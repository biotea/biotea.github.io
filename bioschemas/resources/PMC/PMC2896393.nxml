      <abstract>
        <p>Protein kinase CK2 is frequently up-regulated in human cancers, although the mechanism of CK2 activation in cancer remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of the CK2Î± intronless gene (<italic>CSNK2A1P</italic>, a presumed CK2Î± pseudogene) in the pathogenesis of human cancers. We found evidence of amplification and over-expression of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in non- small cell lung cancer and leukemia cell lines and 25% of the lung cancer tissues studied. The mRNA expression levels correlated with the copy numbers of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene. We also identified a novel polymorphic variant (398T/C, I133T) of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene and showed that the 398T allele is selectively amplified over the 398C allele in 101 non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples compared to those in 48 normal controls (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.013&lt;0.05). We show for the first time CSNK2A1P protein expression in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell lines. Both alleles are transforming in these cell lines, and the 398T allele appears to be more transforming than the 398C allele. Moreover, the 398T allele degrades PML tumor suppressor protein more efficiently than the 398C allele and shows a relatively stronger binding to PML. Knockdown of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene expression with specific siRNA increased the PML protein level in lung cancer cells. We report, for the first time, that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is a functional proto-oncogene in human cancers and its functional polymorphism appears to degrade PML differentially in cancer cells. These results are consistent with an important role for the 398T allele of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> in human lung cancer susceptibility.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the United States <xref rid="pone.0011418-Jemal1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Some of the somatic events involved in lung cancer have been well characterized, but some of them remain unknown <xref rid="pone.0011418-Herbst1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase II) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates more than 300 proteins <xref rid="pone.0011418-Meggio1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It degrades tumor suppressor proteins such as PML <xref rid="pone.0011418-Scaglioni1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and promotes the activity and stability of oncogenic proteins such as AKT <xref rid="pone.0011418-DiMaira1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For instance, CK2 promotes PML degradation and CK2 kinase activity is inversely correlated with PML protein levels in human lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0011418-Scaglioni1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recently, multiple myeloma cell survival was shown to rely on the high activity of protein kinase CK2 <xref rid="pone.0011418-Piazza1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. CK2 also affects several cell signaling pathways, including PI3K, NFkB, and Wnt pathways <xref rid="pone.0011418-Duncan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The level of CK2Î± expression is tightly regulated in normal cells <xref rid="pone.0011418-Olsten1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and increased CK2Î± level and activity has consistently been observed in a variety of human cancers <xref rid="pone.0011418-Sarno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. For instance, the high-level and/or nuclear localization of CK2Î± is a marker of poor prognosis for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer, and squamous cell lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0011418-Sarno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. CK2Î± is the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2 and CK2Î± has been reported to be coded by the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene on chromosome 20p13 <xref rid="pone.0011418-Wirkner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene can serve as an oncogene and its dysregulated expression can induce mammary tumors and lymphomas in transgenic mice <xref rid="pone.0011418-Seldin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-LandesmanBollag1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although the activity of the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene has been shown to be elevated in human cancers, no solid genetic or epigenetic evidence is available regarding the cause of the high-activity of CK2Î± in cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0011418-Sarno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The CK2Î± intronless gene (also known as CK2Î± âpseudogeneâ), <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic>, is located on chromosome 11p15.3 and its sequence is highly homologous (99% identity) to the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> cDNA sequence <xref rid="pone.0011418-Wirkner2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is reportedly expressed in a megakaryocytic cell line <xref rid="pone.0011418-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, its role in cancer cell development remains unknown. We therefore investigated the amplification and expression of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in lung cancer and leukemia cell lines and lung cancer tissues.</p>

        <title>Over-expression and amplification of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in cancer cells and lung cancer tissues</title>
        <p>We focused on the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene because we initially found it was minimally expressed in normal cells, but was predominantly expressed in several types of human cancer cell lines and tumor tissues, including the human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, which is known for its high CK2 activity. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we showed that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is also over-expressed in three NSCLC lines: H1299, H322, and A549, but minimally expressed in normal cells and two lung cancer cell lines H1650 and H460 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> mRNA was overexpressed in lung tumor tissue from seven out of 29 (â¼25%) tumor samples as compared to matched control tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, FISH analysis on the same human cancer cell lines provided solid evidence of the amplification of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene located on chromosome 11p15.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). For example, four copies of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene were found in the human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, and three copies in the lung cancer cell lines H1299, A549, and H322. In contrast, normal lymphocytes and H460 cell line had diploid copies of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Fig. 1C and D</xref>). Importantly, mRNA expression levels correlated with copy numbers of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in these human cancer cell lines (nâ=â8; pearson's Î³â=â0.9346; <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Fig. 1 E</xref>). We further performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the mRNA expression of the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene with specific primers. Overexpression of the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene was also noted in above cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), suggesting that in addition to the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene, the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene also plays important roles in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Alignment of the primers used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR of the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> and <italic>CSNK2A1P genes</italic> were shown in supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011418.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR using CSNK2A1P-specific primers shows the CSNK2A1P mRNA expression level is consistent with the copy numbers detected by FISH (3 for H1299, 4 for Jurkat, 3 for H322 and A549, 2 for WI-38 and CCL-211). (B) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR using CSNK2A1P-specific primers shows the CSNK2A1P mRNA is overexpressed in seven (patient 1 to 7) out of 29 (â¼25%) lung tumors as compared to matched normal adjacent tissue. Patient 8 to 14 represents samples without overexpressed CSNK2A1P mRNA. Other 14 samples with similar results are not shown. (C) The <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is amplified in the human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, and in lung cancer cell lines H1299, A549, and H322. (D) Representative pictures of FISH study results in metaphases of normal lymphocyte, Jurkat, H322 and A549 cell lines. The <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene was labeled with Cy3 (in red). Chromosome 11 centimeter probe was labeled with FITC (in green). (E) Correlation of the copy number and mRNA expression the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene was calculated using pearson correlation. (F) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR using CSNK2A1-specific primers shows the CSNK2A1 mRNA expression level in normal and cancer cell lines mentioned above. All semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments were repeated three times with similar results.</p>

        <title>Allele-specific amplification of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in lung cancer</title>
        <p>To determine whether there are any mutations of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> in human lung cancers, we sequenced the open reading frame of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene. Although we did not find any mutations, we discovered a novel polymorphism within the kinase domain (398T/C, which leads to amino acid change I133T, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) in 18 cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011418-t001">Table 1</xref>) and 101 primary lung cancer tissue samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011418-t002">Table 2</xref>). The specific amino acid change is predicted to affect the protein function when the sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) method is used <xref rid="pone.0011418-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Interestingly, this polymorphism appeared to be evenly distributed in normal tissue, but in tumors, was significantly more frequent at the 398T allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) (Chi-Square test, p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, of the 56 heterozygous lung cancer tissues examined with respect to this polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), 20 (35.7%) samples showed amplification in this region, and in 18 (90%) of those 20 samples, the 398T allele was selectively amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). This selective amplification suggests that the 398T allele might provide a growth advantage over the 398C allele. To further validate the results from DNA sequencing, we investigated the allele-specific amplification of the 398T allele of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> (encoding the Ile133 variant) in human tumors using a quantitative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, i.e., TaqMan-based allelic discrimination assay. The allelic discrimination data is consistent with the sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Of the 101 lung tumor samples typed, 56 were heterozygous with respect to the 398CâT polymorphism, and we analyzed these 56 samples for allele-specific amplification of the 398CâT polymorphism of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> by TaqMan analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Twenty samples showed allelic imbalance between the two alleles, 2 samples showed gain of the 398C allele (encoding Thr133) and 18 samples showed gain of the 398T allele (encoding Ile133). These results show statistically significant allele-specific amplification of the 398T allele (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, Chi-Square test), providing additional evidence for the role of this allele in human lung cancer. These results prompted us to probe more deeply into the role of the variant <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> forms in tumor development.</p>

            <p>(A) Allele-specific amplification of the 398T allele (TTT/C or TT/C) is found in some non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples. The T above the arrowhead (nucleotide 398T, I133,) on the right is the indication of the wild-type gene. (B) Amplification of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> alleles in lung tumors was validated by quantitative allele specific single polymorphism (SNP) analysis. The ratio between the 398T and 398C alleles in heterozygous lung tumors was determined by TaqMan analysis using allele-specific probes and is expressed as differences in CT levels (cycles) with positive or negative ÎCT values indicating amplification of the 398T or 398C allele, respectively. Of 56 samples typed, 2 showed amplification of the 398C allele greater than 0.6 CTs (samples T3â4) and 18 showed amplification of the 398T allele (samples T5â23). Thirty-six samples showed no amplification (represented by T1â2). Normal controls samples showed no amplification (N1â3). The normalized means and standard deviations of three independent experiments are shown. (C, D and E) Allele-specific amplification of the 398T allele significantly increases in non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples. Normal: human adult normal genomic DNA. Tumor: no-small cell lung cancer tissues. * denotes p&lt;0.05 (Chi-square test).</p>

        <p>To test the functional significance of the 398TâC polymorphism in the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene, we cloned the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> and <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes into pcDNA 3.1/myc-His vector and carried out a series of cell growth assays using NIH3T3 cells. In this study, these vectors were transiently transfected into 293T and NIH3T3 cells and western analysis was used to confirm the protein expression of both alleles of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The results show, for the first time, that the expression of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> can produce its proteins.</p>

            <p>(A) The <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> and <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes were transiently transfected into 293T and NIH3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent according to manufacture's protocol. 72 hours after transfection, cells were harvest and total cellular proteins were extracted. Western blot analysis was used to confirm the protein expression in both alleles of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene. Anti-Myc tag antibody was used to detect the CSNK2A1P-Myc tag fusion proteins. (B) Colony formation assay. Transfection of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in NIH3T3 cells results in enhanced anchorage-dependent growth, compared to the empty vector control. The colony numbers of NIH3T3-CSNK2A1 and NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P cells are dramatically higher than those of the NIH3T3-EV cells. (C) Soft agar assay. Stable transfection of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes in NIH3T3 cells results in enhanced anchorage-independent growth. Both the NIH3T3-CSNK2A1 and NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P cells produced significantly more colonies than the NIH3T3-EV cells did (*p&lt;0.05, t-test). Of the two alleles of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene, the 398T allele formed more colonies than the 398C allele did (**p&lt;0.05, t-test). Relative colony formation in both cell lines is expressed as percentage normalized to empty-vector-transfected control group and shown as bar Â± standard deviation in three independent experiments. (D) Kinase assay of the expressed CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A1P proteins in NIH3T3 cells. The expressed proteins were immune-precipitated with Anti-Myc tag antibody and kinase assay was performed. Both the NIH3T3-CSNK2A1 and NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P cells had significantly higher kinase activities than the NIH3T3-EV cells did (*p&lt;0.05, t-test). Of the two alleles of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene, the 398T allele cells had significantly higher kinase activity than the 398C allele did (**p&lt;0.05, t-test). Relative kinase activity is expressed as percentage normalized to empty-vector-transfected control group and shown as bar Â± standard deviation in three independent experiments. EV: empty vector. Wt: CSNK2A1. 398C: CSNK2A1P (I133) 398T: CSNK2A1P (I133T).</p>

        <p>In the colony formation assay, transfection of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes in NIH3T3 (NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P) cells results in enhanced anchorage-dependent growth, compared to the empty vector control (NIH3T3-EV). In addition, we generated NIH3T3 cells with CSNK2A1 (NIH3T3-CSNK2A1) as a positive control. The colony numbers of NIH3T3-CSNK2A1 and NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P cells were dramatically higher than those of the NIH3T3-EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Transfection of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in NIH3T3 cells also resulted in enhanced anchorage-independent growth. When soft agar colony formation assay results were compared, we found that stable transfection of <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes in NIH3T3 cells resulted in enhanced anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Both the NIH3T3-CSNK2A1 and NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P cells produced more colonies than the NIH3T3-EV cells did. Compared to the NIH3T3-EV cells, NIH3T3-CSNK2A1 and NIH3T3-CSNK2A1P cells produced colonies that were mostly bigger and had spread-out shapes. When the two alleles of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes were compared, we found that the 398T allele formed more colonies than the 398C allele did. A kinase assay of the expressed proteins was also performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The 398T gene product has a higher kinase activity than the 398C gene product does. The results from the kinase assay are consistent with the colony formation and soft agar data.</p>

        <title>Functional polymorphism of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes on the degradation of PML tumor suppressor protein</title>
        <p>To determine the potential mechanism by which the 398T allele is preferentially amplified in lung cancer samples, we studied the effects of the two alleles of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene on tumor suppressor PML protein. The <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes were stably transfected into NIH3T3 and NSCLC H1650 cell lines. Western blot analysis showed a reduced PML protein level in the cells transfected with the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> genes. The CSNK2A1P 398T allele, similar to wild-type CSNK2A1, decreased PML protein levels more than the 398C allele did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Second, we determined whether the half-life of PML is differentially regulated by the two alleles. These two cell lines transfected with the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene were treated with cycloheximide for 0, 2, and 6 hours, and the endogenous PML protein levels were examined. The 398T allele decreased the half-life of PML more effectively than the 398C allele did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Third, we used co-immunoprecipitation to show the direct and preferential binding between the 398T protein and PML protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

We chose the H1299 lung cancer cell line because our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g001">Figure 1A and C</xref>) showed that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is amplified and overexpressed in this cell line.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have provided, to our knowledge, the first evidence to show that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is a functional proto-oncogene in human cancers. To support our hypothesis that <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is a functional proto-oncogene, rather than a âpseudogeneâ, we have done extensive DNA, mRNA, protein and siRNA analysis. The results of this analysis provide the first evidence that the mRNA expression level correlates with the copy number of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in several human cancer cell lines. Furthermore, siRNA knock down of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene decreased total CK2Î± protein level in cancer cells, indicating that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is fully translated in cancer cells. Thus, the amplification of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene may play an oncogenic role in these human cancer cell lines. On the basis of our results, we propose that two functional genes may exist in the human CK2Î± family, <italic>CSNK2A1</italic>, which locates on the chromosome 20p13, and <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic>, which locates on the chromosome 11p15.3.</p>
      <p>We also found a novel polymorphism within the kinase domain (398T/C, which leads to amino acid change I133T, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) in 101 primary tumors. This polymorphism appears to be evenly distributed in normal tissue, but in tumors, is significantly more frequent in the 398T allele (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0011418-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The 398T allele was selectively amplified in eighteen of the 101 lung cancer tissues, suggesting it might provide a growth advantage over the 398C allele. The 398C allele amplification was only found in two of the 101 lung cancer tissues, suggesting that it might be a random event. These intriguing genetic results prompted us to probe more deeply into the role of the variant <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> forms in tumor development. Doing so yielded two important findings, first, that the 398T allele is more transforming than the 398C allele, and second, that the 398T allele degrades tumor suppressor PML protein more efficiently than the 398C allele. For instance, the 398T allele showed significantly higher transforming activity in both colony formation and soft agar assays than the 398C allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g003">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). The data of the kinase assay showed that the 398T gene product has higher kinase activity than the 398C gene product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011418-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that the 398T allele is a more transforming allele than the 398C allele. In addition, these data also suggest that the transforming ability of the 398T allele of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> pseudogene is similar to that of the normal <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene product, so the more active allele of the pseudogene appears to have activity comparable to the regular <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene. To date, there is no genetic or epigenetic evidence on the activation of the CSNK2A1 gene in human cancer. Thus our study provides the first evidence that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> 398T allele, which is similar to the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene, is amplified in human lung cancer tissues.</p>
      <p>The PML gene was originally identified at the breakpoint of t(15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia <xref rid="pone.0011418-Melnick1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and was proved to be a tumor suppressor gene <xref rid="pone.0011418-Salomoni1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Loss of PML has been correlated with poor clinical outcome in a variety of human cancers, including lung cancer, supporting its tumor suppressor function <xref rid="pone.0011418-Scaglioni1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-Gurrieri1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. PML promotes the dephosphorylation of pRb and regulates cell fate in the developing neocortex <xref rid="pone.0011418-Regad1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. CK2 regulates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PML in human lung cancer cell lines <xref rid="pone.0011418-Scaglioni1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-Scaglioni2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This may be one the potential mechanisms by which the 398T allele is preferentially amplified in lung cancer samples. This genetic polymorphism is probably a useful marker to detect the amplification of the CK2 intronless gene, because monoallelic amplification is believed to be responsible for gene amplification in cancer <xref rid="pone.0011418-LaFramboise1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This allele-specific amplification also implies that cancer cells may be addicted to the oncogenic CK2Î± <xref rid="pone.0011418-Weinstein1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In short, the amplification of the 398T allele of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene may contribute, at least in part, to the pathogenesis of lung cancer.</p>
      <p>The <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is a processed pseudogene located on the chromosome 11p15.3 and is supposed to be formed by retrotransposition, and characterized by the absence of introns, the presence of flanking directs repeats, and the 3â² polyadenylation tail <xref rid="pone.0011418-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, it has a strong promoter upstream from the initiation codon (14, 15). The expression of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene is potentially more tightly regulated than the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> is. For instance, the promoter region of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene contains two TATA boxes and a CAAT box, while the upstream sequence of <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> displays housekeeping gene characteristics, e.g., high GC content, the presence of several GC boxes and the lack TATA box (14, 15). Moreover, several important transcription factor-binding sites (e.g, CEBP-, GATA-, and SMAD-binding sites) were predicted within the 5â² region (1 Kb) from the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> starting codon, suggesting that the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene may potentially be induced or repressed by several master regulators of developmental pathways. The amplification of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene could result in the overexpression of CSNK2A1P protein in cancer cells. It may also be possible that the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> gene is somehow indirectly regulated by the expression of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene. Future studies are needed to uncover the mechanism through which the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> and the <italic>CSNK2A1</italic> genes are regulated. Until now, around 10,000 processed pseudogenes <xref rid="pone.0011418-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> have been characterized in the human genome, and some of these genes have been reported to be expressed in cancer cells. For instance, the oncogenic <italic>CRIPTO3</italic> pseudogene is expressed in colon, breast and lung cancers <xref rid="pone.0011418-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the human homologue of vaccinia virus H1 phosphotase gene clone 5 (<italic>hVH-5</italic>) pseudogene is expressed in breast cancer cell lines <xref rid="pone.0011418-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and the <italic>rac1</italic> pseudogene is expressed in brain tumors <xref rid="pone.0011418-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Taken together with our results, this suggests a potential oncogenic role of the presumed pseudogenes in some human cancers.</p>
      <p>This study had some limitations. We demonstrated the correlation between <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene and PML protein stability in only two lung cancer cell lines in vitro. Specimens from only 101 lung cancer patients were analyzed, 56 of which were heterozygous with respect to this polymorphism and could be used for the analysis. In future studies, it will be important to include additional cancer cell lines and more cancer tissues.</p>
      <p>Our results provide genetic evidences for activation of the intronless CK2Î± gene in human cancer. Although CK2 was previously known to be a key player in cancer, its mechanism of activation in cancer was not known <xref rid="pone.0011418-Sarno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-Trembley1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Because of this lack of knowledge about the mechanism of CK2 activation and its constitutive activity, CK2 has been mostly neglected as a key target for anti-cancer drugs. Since significant progress has been made on the structural bases of CK2 inhibition, it is now possible to develop potent and selective cell-permeable CK2 inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0011418-Pinna1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-Battistutta1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Understanding the difference in sequences of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene polymorphisms may allow us to design specific diagnostic tests for human cancer. Importantly, our results support the notion that protein kinase CK2Î± is an appealing target for cancer therapeutics such as small-molecule inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0011418-Sarno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011418-Prudent1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 10ÂµM of MG132 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and then harvested in NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1% NP40), protease inhibitor, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Lewes, UK). Immunoprecipitation was performed by the Catch and Release v2.0 Reversible Immunoprecipitation System (Millipore, Bellerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Anti-Myc tag (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-V5 tag (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation respectively.</p>

        <title>Transfection of small interfering RNA</title>
        <p>Pre-designed and validated <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> and universal negative control small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamineâ¢ RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's manual. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in antibiotic-free media and transfection was performed with cells at 60% confluence with a final concentration of 50 nM for each siRNA. At 72 hours after transfection, cells were analyzed for gene and protein expression.</p>

        <title>Allele-specific amplification assays</title>
        <p>The allele-specific amplification was measured using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. PCR reactions for allele-specific expression (5 Âµl) contained 10 ng genomic DNA, 1Ã TaqMan universal PCR master mix, forward and reverse primers (900 nM), 200 nM VIC-labeled probe and 200 nM FAM-labeled probe. Amplification conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 15 s and 63Â°C for 1 min. The data was analyzed using the Allelic Discrimination Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan primers and probes were custom designed using the Primer Express Oligo Design Software (Applied Biosystems). Probes were MGB probes were designed specifically for TaqMan Allelic Discrimination (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-CCGCCTTGGTTTTTGAACAC-3â²</named-content>and <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-GGCCTTCAGAATCTCATACATGTAAA-3â²</named-content>; probe sequences are FAM-CACAGACTATGACTC (398C allele specific) and VIC-TCACAGACTATGATTC (398T allele specific). PCR was done in triplicate for each sample and experiments were repeated at least three times. CT values were normalized to the average normal genomic CT difference in each experiment. The CT value differences between the two probes for the triplicates were then averaged.</p>

        <title>Kinase assays</title>
        <p>For determination of the kinase activity of the expressed CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A1P proteins, Casein Kinase 2 Assay Kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used according to manufacture's protocol. Stable NIH3T3 cells transfected with the CSNK2A1 and CSNK2A1P genes were harvested in NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1% NP40), protease inhibitor, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Lewes, UK). Immunoprecipitation was performed by the Catch and Release v2.0 Reversible Immunoprecipitation System (Millipore, Bellerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Anti-Myc tag (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Kinase assay was carried in a final volume of 50 Âµl containing 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mM Î²-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 15 mM Mgcl<sub>2</sub>, 200 ÂµM for CK2 substrate peptide: RRRDDDSDDD (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and [Î³-33P]-ATP. After incubation in 30Â°C for 20 minutes, assay was stopped by adding of 20 Âµl 4% trichloroacetic acid and transferred 25 Âµl to P81 phosphocellulose squares. After washing with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 6 times and with acetone for 1 time, phosphocellulose squares were dried and transferred to scintillation vials for counting.</p>

        <p>The data are shown as mean values Â± standard deviation (SD). Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare results between control and experimental groups in the colony formation assay. Chi-square test was used to compare the frequency of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> polymorphisms between lung cancer tissues and normal controls. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to access the correlation between mRNA expression and copy numbers of the <italic>CSNK2A1P</italic> gene in cancer cell lines. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (version 10.0, Chicago, IL). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were two-sided.</p>
