      <abstract>
        <p>Human Shugoshin 1 (Sgo1) protects centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion during prophase and prevents premature sister-chromatid separation. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) has been proposed to protect centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion by directly targeting Sgo1 to centromeres in mitosis. Here we show that HP1Î± is targeted to mitotic centromeres by INCENP, a subunit of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). Biochemical and structural studies show that both HP1âINCENP and HP1âSgo1 interactions require the binding of the HP1 chromo shadow domain to PXVXL/I motifs in INCENP or Sgo1, suggesting that the INCENP-bound, centromeric HP1Î± is incapable of recruiting Sgo1. Consistently, a Sgo1 mutant deficient in HP1 binding is functional in centromeric cohesion protection and localizes normally to centromeres in mitosis. By contrast, INCENP or Sgo1 mutants deficient in HP1 binding fail to localize to centromeres in interphase. Therefore, our results suggest that HP1 binding by INCENP or Sgo1 is dispensable for centromeric cohesion protection during mitosis of human cells, but might regulate yet uncharacterized interphase functions of CPC or Sgo1 at the centromeres.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Faithful chromosome segregation is essential for the genomic integrity of eukaryotic cells and requires the proper establishment and resolution of sister-chromatid cohesion (Nasmyth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). The cohesin complex is required for sister-chromatid cohesion and is loaded to chromosomes in telophase and modified during DNA replication to establish functional cohesion (Onn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2008</xref>; Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>; Nasmyth and Haering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2009</xref>). Cohesin removal is a prerequisite for sister-chromatid separation during mitosis and occurs in two steps in vertebrates (Waizenegger <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2000</xref>). In prophase, most cohesin along chromosome arms is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Plk1 (Sumara <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2002</xref>; Hauf <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2005</xref>), and subsequently removed by Wapl (Losada <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2005</xref>; Kueng <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2006</xref>; Shintomi and Hirano, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>). Cohesin at the centromeres (the term âcentromereâ in this article refers to both the core centromere and the pericentric heterochromatin) is, however, protected from the prophase pathway by the Shugoshin 1 (Sgo1)âPP2A complex (Kitajima <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2006</xref>; Riedel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2006</xref>; Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2006</xref>). The centromeric pool of cohesin ensures the biorientation of sister chromatids and is cleaved by separase at the metaphaseâanaphase transition (Hauf <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2001</xref>; Onn <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2008</xref>; Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>; Nasmyth and Haering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2009</xref>).</p><p>Three mechanisms have been suggested to target Sgo1 to centromeres during mitosis of human cells. First, the mitotic kinase Bub1 phosphorylates centromeric histone H2A at its C-terminal tail (Kawashima <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2010</xref>). This phospho-histone mark is required to target Sgo1 to centromeres. Second, PP2A prevents Plk1-dependent removal of Sgo1 from chromosomes (Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2006</xref>). Third, Sgo1 binds to heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and this interaction has been proposed to promote Sgo1 centromeric localization in mitosis (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>).</p><p>Human cells contain three HP1 proteins: HP1Î±, HP1Î², and HP1Î³ (Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>; Maison and Almouzni, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>). Each HP1 protein has an N-terminal chromo domain (CD) that binds to di-/trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9me2/3), a flexible hinge region, and a C-terminal chromo shadow domain (CSD) that interacts with PXVXL/I motifs in a diverse set of proteins (Smothers and Henikoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2000</xref>; Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>; Maison and Almouzni, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2004</xref>; Thiru <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>; Nozawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2010</xref>). In interphase, HP1 is targeted to centromeric heterochromatin through the CDâH3-K9me2/3 interaction and further recruits other proteins to centromeres through the CSDâPXVXL/I interaction. During mitosis, Aurora B in the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) phosphorylates histone H3 serine 10 (H3-pS10), disrupts the HP1 CDâH3-K9me2/3 interaction, and releases HP1 from chromatin (Fischle <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>; Hirota <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2005</xref>; Ruchaud <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). In addition, inactivation of the Suv39h methyltransferases that write the H3-K9me2/3 marks does not cause gross sister-chromatid cohesion defects in mammalian cells (Koch <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2008</xref>). Therefore, inactivation of centromeric targeting of HP1 mediated by the CDâH3-K9me2/3 interaction does not appear to be required for centromeric cohesion protection. These findings have cast doubts about the proposed function of HP1 in recruiting Sgo1 to mitotic centromeres. Nonetheless, HP1Î± can be detected at mitotic centromeres in human cells (Hayakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>). Furthermore, the mitotic centromeric targeting of HP1Î± is independent of its CD (Hayakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>). Thus, it has been suggested that HP1 is recruited to mitotic centromeres through a mechanism distinct from that in interphase and that this pool of HP1 at mitotic centromeres contributes to Sgo1 targeting through a CSD-dependent interaction (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the role of the Sgo1âHP1 interaction in centromeric cohesion protection in human cells, we have determined the mechanism by which HP1Î± is targeted to mitotic centromeres. Consistent with previous observations (Ainsztein <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1998</xref>; Nozawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2010</xref>), we show that HP1 binds to INCENP, a subunit of CPC, and that this interaction involves the binding of HP1 CSD and a PXVXL/I motif in INCENP. We further show that the HP1âINCENP interaction is required for the recruitment of HP1Î± to mitotic centromeres. Because the HP1âSgo1 interaction also requires HP1 CSD and a PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1 (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>), the INCENP-bound centromeric HP1 is incapable of binding Sgo1. Consistently, an INCENP mutant deficient in HP1 binding fully rescues mitotic defects of INCENP RNAi cells. More importantly, a Sgo1 mutant deficient of HP1 binding is fully functional in sister-chromatid cohesion. Therefore, our results indicate that the Sgo1âHP1 interaction is dispensable for sister-chromatid cohesion. Both INCENP and Sgo1 mutants deficient of HP1 binding fail to enrich at interphase centromeres, suggesting that HP1 might regulate yet unidentified interphase functions of Sgo1 and CPC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>HP1 binds to INCENP through its CSD</title><p>To study the potential functions of HP1 in chromosome segregation, we constructed HeLa cell lines that stably expressed HP1-CFP and examined HP1 localization in different cell-cycle stages. Consistent with previous reports (Hayakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>), we observed centromeric localization of HP1Î±, HP1Î², and HP1Î³ during interphase. Most HP1 proteins were released from chromatin in mitosis, but HP1Î± still localized to the centromeres during mitosis (Supplemental Figure S1A). Ectopically expressed HP1Î² and HP1Î³ did not enrich at the mitotic centromeres (Supplemental Figure S1B). In mitotic chromosome spread, the endogenous HP1Î± localized at the inner centromeres (Supplemental Figure S1C), whereas HP1Î² and HP1Î³ did not (unpublished data). Interestingly, a small pool of HP1Î± was also seen at the midbody during telophase (Supplemental Figure S1A).</p><p>Many regulators of cytokinesis, including the CPC, localize to the midbody (Ruchaud <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). CPC consists of four subunits, Aurora B, INCENP, survivin, and borealin (Ruchaud <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). It is critical for several mitotic processes, including chromosome alignment, the spindle checkpoint, and cytokinesis. Consistent with its multiple functions, CPC exhibits a dynamic localization pattern during mitosis. It localizes to centromeres and chromosome arms during prophase, to centromeres during metaphase, to the central spindle and the cleavage furrow in anaphase, and to the midbody during telophase. The midbody localization of HP1Î± suggested to us that HP1 might interact with CPC. Consistently, HP1Î± had previously been shown to interact with INCENP, a CPC subunit, although the function of such an interaction was unclear (Ainsztein <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1998</xref>). We thus decided to further investigate the function of the HP1Î±âINCENP interaction in mitosis.</p><p>We first confirmed the interaction between HP1 and INCENP. Myc-INCENP bound to all three HA-HP1 proteins (Supplemental Figure S1D). The endogenous INCENP bound to HP1Î± during mitosis (Supplemental Figure S2A). Further domain-mapping experiments narrowed the HP1-binding region of INCENP to residues 124â248 (unpublished data). Deletion of this region (referred to as INCENP Î125) greatly diminished the interaction between INCENP and HP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S1D). A previous study showed that the C-terminal region of HP1Î± containing the hinge region and the CSD was sufficient to bind to INCENP (Hayakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>). We tested whether mutation of several conserved basic residues in the HP1Î± hinge region to glutamates (HP1 KE) affected INCENP binding. Mutation of the hinge region disrupted the nuclear localization of HP1Î± (unpublished data), suggesting that this region might contain a nuclear localization signal. GST-HP1Î± KE bound to INCENP slightly less efficiently, as compared with GST-HP1Î± WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>INCENP binding and mitotic centromere localization of HP1 require the CSD. (A) Recombinant purified GST, GST-HP1Î± WT, or GST-HP1Î± hinge mutant (KE; K89E, R90E, and K91E) on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with in vitro translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Myc-INCENP WT or Î125. Bound fractions were analyzed by SDSâPAGE followed by autoradiography and Coomassie blue staining.

DIC, differential interference contrast.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1181fig1"/></fig><p>We next showed that recombinant HP1 CSD alone bound to INCENP efficiently in vitro (unpublished data). HP1 CSD binds to peptide motifs with the consensus of PXVXL/I. The HP1-binding domain of INCENP contains one such motif at residues 167â171. An INCENP mutant with this PVVEI motif mutated to AVAEA (referred to as INCENP 3A) bound to HP1Î± much more weakly than INCENP WT did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that the HP1Î±âINCENP interaction is mainly mediated through HP1 CSD, with the HP1 hinge region playing an auxiliary role.</p></sec><sec><title>The HP1Î±âINCENP interaction is required for targeting HP1Î± to mitotic centromeres</title><p>Centromeric localization of HP1Î± in mitosis was previously shown to be mediated through its C-terminal region, including the hinge region and CSD (Hayakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2003</xref>). We examined the localization of the HP1Î± hinge mutant (KE) and an HP1Î± CSD mutant (W174A) that lost its ability to bind PXVXL/I ligands. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-HP1Î± WT and mCherry-INCENP colocalized to centromeres in both interphase and mitosis. GFP-HP1Î± W174A localized normally to centromeres in interphase but failed to localize to centromeres in mitosis. By contrast, GFP-HP1Î± KE still localized to mitotic centromeres. Therefore, HP1Î± CSD is largely responsible for its centromeric targeting in mitosis. Different mechanisms mediate HP1 centromere targeting during interphase and mitosis.</p><p>We then tested whether the INCENPâHP1Î± interaction regulated each otherâs centromeric localization. Both mCherry-INCENP WT and Î125 localized at the centromeres during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that the INCENPâHP1Î± interaction was not critical for the centromeric localization of INCENP. Consistent with previous reports, depletion of INCENP caused enhanced chromosome arm localization of GFP-HP1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and Supplemental Figure S2B). Ectopic expression of mCherry-INCENP WT restored the centromeric localization of GFP-HP1Î± in mitosis. By contrast, expression of INCENP Î125 (which was deficient in HP1Î± binding) did not restore the centromeric localization of GFP-HP1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and B</xref>) or the endogenous HP1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, C and D</xref>). Therefore, INCENP is critical for HP1Î± centromeric localization in mitosis. Because the mitotic centromeric localization of HP1Î± also requires the ligand-binding activity of its CSD, our results collectively indicate that HP1Î± centromeric targeting in mitosis is mediated by an interaction between HP1Î± CSD and the PVVEI motif in INCENP.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>INCENP recruits HP1Î± to mitotic centromeres.

Neither cell line exhibited gross premature sister-chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar results were obtained for two different clones of each cell line.

We did not observe significant differences in mitotic timing between these two cell lines (Supplemental Figure S5).

Similar nucleolus localization was observed for the INCENP 3A mutant (unpublished data). Therefore the INCENPâHP1 interaction is not required for proper mitotic progression or sister-chromatid cohesion, but regulates the centromeric localization of INCENP and possibly CPC in interphase.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural basis for HP1 CSD binding to the PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1</title><p>HP1Î± has been suggested to contribute to centromeric targeting of Sgo1 in mitosis through a direct interaction between HP1Î± CSD and a PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1 in human cells (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>). In contrast, our results described earlier in the text show that the centromeric targeting of HP1Î± in mitosis requires an interaction between HP1Î± CSD and a PXVXL/I motif in INCENP. The centromeric pool of HP1Î± is thus bound to INCENP and is incapable of simultaneously binding to Sgo1. We therefore decided to further characterize the Sgo1âHP1 interaction.</p><p>Human Sgo1 contains two PXVXL/I motifs that can potentially bind to HP1 CSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We synthesized two peptides (Sgo1P1 and Sgo1P2) containing either motif and tested their binding to HP1Î² CSD by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Sgo1P1 bound to HP1Î² CSD with a dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.18 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas no detectable binding was observed between HP1Î² CSD and Sgo1P2. Mutation of the P1 motif in Sgo1 (P1A) disrupted the Myc-HP1Î±âGFP-Sgo1 interaction in cells, whereas mutation of the P2 motif had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore the P1 motif is necessary and sufficient for HP1 binding.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>Binding Sgo1 to HP1 involves HP1 CSD and a PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1.

As expected, HP1Î² CSD forms a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). One CSD dimer binds to one Sgo1P1 peptide. Each CSD monomer has a mixed Î±/Î² fold, in which a three-stranded antiparallel Î² sheet (Î²1â3) packs against an N-terminal 3<sub>10</sub> helix and two Î± helices (Î±A and Î±B). Î±A and Î±B form the dimer interface. Sgo1P1 is sandwiched between the Î²4 strands of the two CSD monomers. The N-terminal segment of Sgo1P1 (residues 448â452) forms antiparallel Î² sheet interactions with Î²4 of one CSD monomer, whereas the C-terminal segment of Sgo1P1 (residues 453â456) forms parallel Î² sheet interactions with Î²4 of the other CSD monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). P451, V453, and I455 of the PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1P1 form extensive hydrophobic interactions with CSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). R457 packs against CSD W170 (equivalent to W174 in HP1Î±) and also forms an electrostatic interaction with CSD D127. These interactions were similar to those observed in the solution structure of mouse HP1Î² CSD bound to the PXVXL/I motif in chromatin assembly factor-1 (Thiru <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>). Therefore, our biochemical and structural analyses confirm that the Sgo1âHP1 interaction adopts a canonical binding mode between HP1 CSD and the PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1.</p></sec><sec><title>The Sgo1âHP1 interaction is not required for sister-chromatid cohesion</title><p>Our results so far have established that HP1Î± is recruited to mitotic centromeres by INCENP through the CSDâPXVXL/I interaction. Binding of Sgo1 to HP1 requires a similar molecular interaction. The centromeric pool of HP1Î± is thus not expected to bind Sgo1 and is indeed not required for mitotic centromeric localization of Sgo1 or centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion. It has, however, been argued that Sgo1 needs to be recruited to centromeres in interphase to promote centromeric cohesion protection in mitosis (Perera and Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2010</xref>). HP1 might contribute to Sgo1 recruitment to centromeres in interphase. Furthermore, it is possible that the cytoplasmic pool of HP1 might indirectly regulate Sgo1 function at centromeres in mitosis.</p><p>To directly examine the functions of the Sgo1âHP1 interaction, we created HeLa cell lines that stably expressed Myc-Sgo1 WT or the Sgo1 P1A mutant deficient for HP1 binding driven by the tetracycline-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and depleted the endogenous Sgo1 with RNAi from these cells. In the absence of doxycycline and ectopic Myc-Sgo1 WT expression, Sgo1 depletion resulted in premature sister-chromatid separation and mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). Ectopic expression of Myc-Sgo1 WT induced by doxycycline effectively rescued these phenotypes. Surprisingly, doxycycline-induced expression of Myc-Sgo1 P1A also rescued the mitotic phenotypes caused by Sgo1 RNAi. In fact, even the leaky expression of Myc-Sgo1 P1A in the absence of doxycycline greatly reduced the mitotic index and chromosome missegregation caused by Sgo1 RNAi. Two other Myc-Sgo1 P1A-expressing clones exhibited similar phenotypes (Supplemental Figure S6). Therefore, the Sgo1 P1A mutant deficient in HP1 binding is functional in centromeric cohesion protection. Consistently, both Myc-Sgo1 WT and P1A localized properly to centromeres in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">E</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5:</label><caption><p>The Sgo1âHP1 interaction is dispensable for Sgo1 localization and sister-chromatid cohesion.

Moreover, the timing of GFP-Sgo1 P1A localization to the centromeres during mitosis was indistinguishable from that of GFP-Sgo1 WT.

The CD is required for targeting HP1Î± to centromeres in interphase, whereas the CSD mediates HP1Î± centromeric localization in mitosis. Consistent with this finding, Aurora B (as a subunit of CPC) phosphorylates H3-S10 during mitosis and disrupts the interaction between HP1Î± CD and H3-K9me2/3 (Fischle <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>; Hirota <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2005</xref>). These earlier findings suggest that centromeric targeting of HP1Î± in mitosis likely involves the binding of its CSD with centromeric proteins containing PXVXL/I motifs. Intriguingly, two studies have shown that HP1Î± binds to the CPC subunit INCENP through its CSD (Ainsztein <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1998</xref>; Nozawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2010</xref>). In this study, we show that the HP1Î±âINCENP interaction is indeed required for the centromeric localization of HP1Î± in mitosis. Cells expressing an INCENP mutant deficient for HP1Î± binding fail to localize HP1Î± to centromeres in mitosis. Our study has thus identified the major mitotic centromeric receptor of HP1Î±.</p><p>Collectively, these findings establish that distinct mechanisms target HP1Î± to centromeres during interphase and mitosis, and support the following model for HP1 centromeric targeting during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In interphase, HP1 CD binds to H3-K9me2/3 and recruits HP1 to centromeres in interphase. In mitosis, Aurora B phosphorylates H3-S10 and releases most HP1 from chromatin by disrupting the CDâH3-K9me2/3 interaction. HP1Î± CSD binds to a PXVXL/I motif in INCENP, maintaining a pool of HP1Î± at centromeres in mitosis.</p><p>Another recent study has shown that HP1Î± binds to the Mis14 (also known as Nsl1) subunit of the Mis12 kinetochore complex only in interphase, but not in mitosis (Kiyomitsu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2010</xref>). The interphase HP1Î±âMis14 interaction is nonetheless required for the centromeric localization of HP1 in mitosis. Interestingly, mutations of Mis14 that disrupt its binding to HP1Î± in interphase also cause defects in the centromeric localization of CPC (and presumably INCENP) in mitosis. Therefore, the defective HP1Î± mitotic centromeric localization in cells expressing these Mis14 mutants is likely an indirect consequence of the loss of INCENP localization at centromeres. How the HP1Î±âMis14 interaction in interphase promotes the centromeric localization of CPC during mitosis is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>What is the function of centromeric HP1Î± during mitosis?</title><p>As discussed earlier in the text, we have demonstrated in this study that INCENP directly recruits HP1Î± to centromeres in mitosis. Surprisingly, cells expressing an INCENP mutant deficient for HP1 binding undergo proper mitotic progression. They do not exhibit discernible defects in chromosome alignment, sister-chromatid cohesion, cytokinesis, or the spindle checkpoint. Therefore the INCENPâHP1Î± interaction appears to be dispensable for the mitotic processes examined. We cannot exclude the possibility that the residual, undetectable amount of HP1Î± at centromeres is still sufficient for its mitotic functions.</p><p>It has been proposed that centromeric HP1Î± directly recruits Sgo1 to centromeres in mitosis of human cells (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>). We have shown, however, that both Sgo1 binding and INCENP binding to HP1 involve the binding of HP1 CSD to canonical PXVXL/I motifs on Sgo1 or INCENP. The INCENP-bound HP1Î± cannot simultaneously bind to Sgo1, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, the centromeric pool of HP1Î± is unlikely to directly contribute to Sgo1 centromeric recruitment in mitosis. This notion is consistent with the lack of mitotic phenotypes in cells expressing HP1-binding-deficient mutants of INCENP.</p><p>What, then, is the function of centromeric HP1Î± in mitosis? We envision two possibilities. First, HP1-binding-deficient mutants of INCENP fail to localize to centromeres in interphase. HP1 binding of INCENP during mitosis may facilitate the return of INCENP and CPC to centromeres following mitotic exit and Aurora B inactivation. The function of INCENP at interphase centromeres, if any, is unclear at present. Second, a recent study has shown that the POGZ protein releases HP1Î± from mitotic chromosomes by disrupting HP1Î± binding to proteins containing PXVXL/I motifs (Nozawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2010</xref>). Depletion of POGZ from human cells causes mitotic phenotypes similar to those caused by Aurora B inactivation. That study suggests that HP1Î± negatively regulates the functions of CPC during mitosis, although the mechanism of such regulation is not understood. It is thus possible that the HP1Î±âINCENP interaction in mitosis attenuates Aurora B function and might be one of several redundant mechanisms contributing to CPC inactivation during mitotic exit.</p></sec><sec><title>What is the function of the HP1âSgo1 interaction?</title><p>During meiosis in fission yeast, Swi6 (the HP1 orthologue) binds directly to Sgo1 (the meiotic form of shugoshin) and recruits Sgo1 to centromeres (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>). Sgo1 mutations that disrupt Swi6 binding also disrupt the centromeric localization of Sgo1. Therefore, the HP1âshugoshin interaction is clearly critical for meiotic progression in the fission yeast. The mitotic functions of HP1 in Sgo1 regulation and centromeric cohesion in mammalian cells have been murky, however. Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic> first showed that human Sgo1 bound directly to HP1 through a CSDâPXVXL/I interaction (Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2008</xref>). They further showed that depletion of HP1Î± from human cells by RNAi weakened Sgo1 centromeric localization after a prolonged mitotic arrest and caused premature sister-chromatid separation. They concluded that HP1Î± directly recruited Sgo1 to mitotic centromeres and contributed to centromeric cohesion protection in human cells. In contrast, a later study reported that depletion of HP1Î± failed to produce mitotic defects in human cells (Serrano <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>), casting doubts on the original report by Yamagishi <italic>et al.</italic> In addition, our results presented here suggest that the centromeric pool of HP1 bound to INCENP cannot physically interact with Sgo1. Our finding further questions the validity of the proposed, direct contribution of HP1Î± in Sgo1 centromeric targeting during mitosis of human cells.</p><p>To resolve this controversy, we further examined the effects of depleting HP1Î± in human cells. In our experiments, some, but not all, HP1Î± siRNAs that depleted HP1Î± caused loss of Sgo1 localization at centromeres and premature sister-chromatid separation (unpublished results). Ectopic expression of siRNA-resistant HP1Î±, however, failed to rescue the mitotic defects of HP1Î± RNAi cells, raising the possibility that the observed mitotic defects caused by certain HP1Î± siRNAs were due to off-target effects. Furthermore, human cells contain three HP1 isoforms (Î±, Î², and Î³). It is exceedingly difficult to deplete all three isoforms and perform functional rescue experiments to ascertain the specificity of RNAi-mediated depletion.</p><p>To avoid these complications, we have focused on the phenotypes of cells expressing a Sgo1 mutant deficient of HP1 binding in this study. Mutation of the sole, functional PXVXL/I motif in Sgo1 disrupts HP1 binding. Ectopic expression of this Sgo1 mutant fully restores sister-chromatid cohesion and Sgo1 centromeric localization in Sgo1 RNAi cells. This result indicates that the HP1âSgo1 interaction is dispensable for mitotic progression and sister-chromatid cohesion during mitosis in human cells. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that HP1 binding is one of several redundant mechanisms targeting Sgo1 to centromeres in mitosis.</p><p>The HP1Î±-binding-deficient mutant of Sgo1 does not localize to centromeres during interphase, indicating that, like the HP1âINCENP interaction, the HP1âSgo1 interaction is required for the interphase centromeric localization of Sgo1. Consistent with our findings, inactivation of Suv39H also disrupted the centromeric targeting of Sgo1 in interphase (Perera and Taylor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2010</xref>). In contrast, the interphase centromeric localization of Sgo1 does not appear to be critical for centromeric cohesion protection in mitosis, as the HP1Î±-binding-deficient mutant of Sgo1 is functional in sister-chromatid cohesion. Future studies are needed to address the functions of Sgo1 at the interphase centromeres.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, we have shown that HP1Î± is targeted to mitotic centromeres through an interaction between its CSD and a PXVXL/I motif in INCENP.

The bound proteins were resolved by SDSâPAGE followed by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence (IF) and chromosome spread</title><p>For HP1Î± localization, HeLa tet-on cells were grown in six-well plates, trypsinized, resuspended in hypotonic solution (55 mM KCl), spun down onto slides by Shandon Cytospin 4 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with the IF buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing 0.1% Triton X-100), and incubated with Î±-HP1Î± (1 Î¼g/ml) in the IF buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with the IF buffer, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanateâ or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies (4 Î¼g/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the IF buffer containing 3% BSA for 1 h, washed again with the IF buffer containing 1 Î¼g/ml 4â,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and analyzed using a DeltaVision deconvolution fluorescence microscope with a 60Ã objective. In other cases, IF was performed similarly, except that cells were extracted with the IF buffer before fixation. For quantitative analysis, the signal intensities of proteins in five randomly chosen centromeres of a given cell were averaged, subtracted by background, and normalized by the staining intensity of CREST. For chromosome spread, HeLa tet-on cells were grown in six-well plates, trypsinized, treated with hypotonic solution, fixed in the fixative solution (methanol/acetic acid = 3:1 [vol/vol]), dropped on slides, and stained with 5% Giemsa solution in PBS.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro binding assay</title><p>For in vitro binding assays, â¼2 Î¼g of purified GST-HP1Î± was incubated with 5 Î¼l of glutathione beads in 50 Î¼l of Q-A buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were then incubated with 400 Î¼l of blocking solution (25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5% dry milk) for 1 h. Ten microliters of in vitro translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled INCENP was added and incubated for 1 h. After washing with blocking solution without dry milk, the beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDSâPAGE followed by autoradiography.</p></sec><sec><title>ITC</title><p>ITC was performed with a MicroCal Omega VP-ITC titration calorimeter (GE Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) at 20ÂºC. Human HP1Î² CSD was expressed in bacteria and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The Sgo1P1 (residues 425â443) and Sgo1P2 (residues 443â458) were chemically synthesized. For each titration experiment, 2 ml of 50 Î¼M HP1Î² CSD in a phosphate buffer was added to the calorimeter cell. Sgo1P1 or Sgo1P2 (0.4 mM) in the exact same buffer was injected with 28 steps of 10 Î¼l each with an injection syringe. Binding parameters were analyzed as a single binding site model using the Origin 7.0 software package (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>X-ray crystallography</title><p>HP1Î² CSD was concentrated to 14 mg/ml and mixed with SgoP1 at a molar ratio of 1:1.2. Crystals of the HP1Î²âSgo1P1 complex were obtained by adding 1 Î¼l of the above mixture to 1 Î¼l of a crystallization buffer (0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 6.6, 0.2 M NaCl, and 21% [wt/vol] PEG 3350) and incubating for 14 d. The crystals diffracted x-rays to a d<sub>min</sub> of â¼1.9 Ã. X-ray diffraction data were acquired from a single crystal on beamline 19-ID at the Structural Biology Center at Argonne National Laboratories. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1997</xref>). The data were further treated to correct negative intensities (French and Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1978</xref>). Phases for the structure were obtained by molecular replacement using the program Phaser (Read, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2001</xref>; Storoni <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2004</xref>). The HP1Î² CSD subunit from the crystal structure of the HP1Î² CSDâEMSY complex (PDB ID:2FMM) was used as the search model (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2006</xref>). The structure was refined using Phenix (Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2010</xref>) and manually adjusted using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>). Parameters and statistics of the structure determination and refinement are shown in Supplemental Table S1. There were four HP1Î² CSD and two Sgo1P1 molecules in one asymmetric unit. Gel filtration chromatography, however, confirmed that the HP1Î² CSDâSgo1P1 complex in solution contained two HP1Î² CSD and one Sgo1P1 molecules.</p></sec></sec>
