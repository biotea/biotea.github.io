      <abstract>
        <p>Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis triggers the ER stress response (also known as Unfolded Protein Response), a hallmark of many pathological disorders. However the connection between ER stress and inflammation remains largely unexplored. Recent data suggest that ER stress controls the activity of inflammasomes, key signaling platforms that mediate innate immune responses. Here we report that expression of NLRP1, a core inflammasome component, is specifically up-regulated during severe ER stress conditions in human cell lines. Both IRE1Î± and PERK, but not the ATF6 pathway, modulate <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression. Furthermore, using mutagenesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing technology, we demonstrate that ATF4 transcription factor directly binds to <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter during ER stress. Although involved in different types of inflammatory responses, XBP-1 splicing was not required for <italic>NLRP1</italic> induction. This study provides further evidence that links ER stress with innate</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a specialized organelle that controls the biogenesis of membrane-anchored and secreted proteins[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Beyond this biosynthetic role, the ER is also a dynamic cellular compartment that plays critical roles in calcium storage[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and cellular homeostasis[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Perturbations in the ER triggered by increased protein synthesis, accumulation of misfolded proteins, nutrient deprivation, or alterations in the calcium or redox balance can lead to a condition called ER stress[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ER imbalance activates a transcriptional and translational program known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive signaling cascade that primarily acts to restore ER homeostasis[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Specifically, the UPR activates three main signaling pathways initiated by different ER transmembrane sensors: PERK, IRE1Î± and ATF6, which cause initial shutdown in mRNA translation along with up-regulation of genes encoding protein chaperones and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, if ER stress is not mitigated, a cell death program is then initiated[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>In addition to its adaptive role, the UPR also regulates the inflammatory state, a circumstance that is frequently present in many metabolic conditions such as obesity and diabetes[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as well as neurodegenerative diseases[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and a variety of bacterial and viral infections[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The mechanisms linking ER stress to inflammation are only partly understood (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]).</p>
      <p>The pleiotropic transcription factor XBP-1s, generated through unconventional mRNA splicing mediated by IRE1Î±, enhances protein folding and has been shown to control intestinal inflammation in patients affected with inflammatory bowel disease[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. IRE1Î±-XBP-1s signaling is also activated by extracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) during bacterial infections and is responsible for sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to XBP-1 activation, IRE1Î± controls inflammatory cytokine secretion in rheumatoid arthritis through the adaptor molecule TRAF6[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and leads to NF-ÎºB and JNK activation pathways by recruiting TRAF2, an adapter protein and E3 ligase associated with several TNF-family receptors[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, PKR-like ER-resident kinase (PERK)-mediated phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2Î± also contributes to NF-ÎºB activation by repressing the synthesis of the inhibitor IkBÎ±[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. By means of eIF2Î± phosphorylation, PERK promotes translation of ATF4 mRNA, a transcription factor that is a central hub of the more general integrated stress response (ISR)[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and which has been recently implicated in viral infections, Alzheimerâs disease and diabetes[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>Members of the NLR (Nucleotide-binding NACHT domain and Leucine-Rich Repeat containing proteins) family of proteins are critical components of host innate immunity in many species[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Interestingly, IRE1Î± and PERK pathways have recently been shown to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent cell death and IL-1Î² secretion through the thioredoxin-interacting protein TXNIP[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another NLR protein, NLRP1, has also been shown to participate in both cell death[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and IL-1Î² secretion[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but its involvement in UPR signaling has not previously been reported. In this study, we investigated the regulation of NLRP1 inflammasome in response to ER perturbations. We found that both PERK and IRE1Î± stimulate <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene transcription through the transcription factor ATF4, involving a mechanism that is independent of XBP-1 mRNA splicing.</p>

        <p>HeLa cells (~1.2 x 10<sup>6</sup>) were treated overnight with DMSO or 2Î¼M BFA. On the following day the cells were washed twice with PBS and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at RT. Formaldehyde was quenched with 0.2M glycine for 10 minutes at RT. Cells were then lysed for 10 minutes with rotation at 4Â°C in 1ml buffer LB1 (50mM Hepes-KOH pH7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40 and 0.25% Triton X-100). Nuclei were pelleted and washed first with 1ml buffer LB2 (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA pH8.0 and 0.5mM EGTA pH8.0) and then washed and resuspended in 750Î¼l buffer LB3 (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA pH8.0, 0.5mM EGTA pH8.0, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine and protease inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated on ice with 10 seconds burst at 20% amplitude (Branson Sonifier S-450) with a 50 seconds pause between each cycle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. After removing 5% of the volume (input), the remainder was split into two aliquots and incubated overnight with 30Î¼l protein G magnetic beads coated with antibodies. To coat the beads, they were equilibrated and washed in PBS with 0.5% BSA, incubated for 4 hours with ATF4 or control IgG antibody, and resuspended in buffer WB I (50mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA). The beads were then washed once with WB I, once with WB II (50mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA), once with WB III (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 250mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA) and twice with TE buffer. Beads were then eluted with 200Î¼l 10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 0.5% SDS, 300mM NaCl and 5mM EDTA with shaking at 65Â°C for 30 minutes, and then were reverse cross-linked at 65Â°C overnight together with the input. RNA and proteins were removed by digestion with RNase at 37Â°C for 30 minutes and with proteinase K at 55Â°C for 1 hour. Finally, the DNA was purified using QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and resuspended in 40Î¼l water.

        <p>Since ER stress was shown previously to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we explored the effects of ER stress on <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression. Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 with two different ER stress inducers, tunicamycin (TM)âto inhibit N-linked glycosylationâand thapsigargin (TG)âto inhibit the ATP-dependent calcium pump SERCA-, produced marked increases in NLRP1 mRNA expression (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, the well-known NLRP3 inflammasome activator uric acid (MSU)[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] did not. We further tested ER stress-dependent NLRP1 induction in Jurkat cells, a human T cell line that normally does not express NLRP3 but has elevated NLRP1 mRNA basal levels (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). The ER-Golgi transport blocker brefeldin A (BFA) and TG both induced time-dependent increases in NLRP1 mRNA levels in Jurkat cells (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>), while the TLR7 ligand and NLRP3 inflammasome activator R837[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] had no effect on NLRP1 mRNA expression. Similarly, time-dependent NLRP1 up-regulation was observed in HeLa epithelial cancer cells that have very low NLRP1 mRNA basal levels (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Time-course experiments with either BFA or TG showed that ER stress increased NLRP1 expression after 12 or 6 hours respectively (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To test whether ER stress specifically induces <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression, we stimulated HCT116 human colon cancer cells with various inflammatory stimuli and measured mRNA expression of both NLRP1 and NOD1 (NLRC1), which is another human NLR family member. Induction of <italic>NLRP1</italic> but not <italic>NOD1</italic> gene expression was observed only during ER stress conditions induced by BFA treatment but not by other pro-inflammatory stimuli (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Next, to perform a more comprehensive analysis, we stimulated HeLa cells with TM for different times and performed a transcriptome study by total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We focused on all currently known human NLR genes and found that among the 17 NLRs only NLRP1 and NLRC5 were expressed at any time point, while NLRP1 alone showed up-regulation under ER stress conditions (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next investigated whether increased NLRP1 mRNA levels upon ER stress correlate with increased NLRP1 protein expression. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts from BFA-treated HeLa, THP-1 and K562 cells showed up-regulation of a 130 kDa band (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), presumably corresponding to NLRP1 N-terminal autocleaved fragment[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Since a barely visible 130 kDa band was detected in HeLa cells after BFA treatment, we pulled-down endogenous NLRP1 protein. Immunoblot analysis revealed specific up-regulation of both cleaved and un-cleaved (around 165 kDa) fragments of NLRP1 during ER stress conditions in all cell lines, with the addition of an intermediate cleavage product in K562 cells (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). To confirm antibody specificity, we utilized HeLa, THP-1 and K562 cells in which <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene locus was deleted using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results show that perturbations of ER homeostasis in a variety of human cell lines specifically increase NLRP1 expression but not other NLR family genes.</p>

To verify whether these pathways could be involved in NLRP1 regulation, HeLa cells were transfected with a combination of two different siRNA for IRE1Î±, PERK and ATF6 and then stimulated overnight with the ER stress inducer, BFA.

        <p>To confirm these results, we derived HeLa cells wherein shRNA-mediated suppression of IRE1Î±, PERK or ATF6 could be conditionally induced using doxycycline (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Doxycycline-mediated knock-down of IRE1Î± and PERK but not ATF6 decreased NLRP1 mRNA induction upon BFA-induced ER stress, suggesting that a combination of transcription factors downstream of IRE1Î± (such as XBP-1s) and PERK (such as ATF4) activates the <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter during ER stress conditions. The specificity of silencing each of the UPR pathways was verified by evaluating the expression of genes known to be regulated entirely by only one pathway[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], namely ERdj4 by IRE1Î±, ATF3 by PERK, and BIP by ATF6 (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Notably, ATF6 down-regulation resulted in an increased activation of IRE1Î± endoribonuclease activity as demonstrated by the increased XBP-1 splicing (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) and ERdj4 expression (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), which is in agreement with previous studies[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but interestingly did not affect NLRP1 mRNA levels. These results indicate that both IRE1Î± and PERK but not ATF6 contribute to <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene induction during ER stress. However, the observations regarding the indirect effects of ATF6 on XBP-1s imply that XBP-1s is not the downstream mediator of IRE1Î±âs contributions to <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression.</p>

        <title>ATF4 but not XBP-1s stimulates NLRP1 up-regulation during ER stress</title>
        <p>Because ATF4 mRNA is latent in cells, becoming actively translated only after induction of ER stress conditions, we tested whether protein biosynthesis is required for NLRP1 induction. Using cycloheximide (CHX), we found that new protein synthesis is necessary for up-regulating <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression after ER stress induction (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, unconventional splicing of XBP-1 mRNA also required protein synthesis (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>), thus these CHX experiments did not differentiate between the IRE1Î±/XBP-1s versus PERK/ATF4 pathways. Furthermore, two different transcriptional inhibitors, actinomycin D (ActD) and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (DRB), markedly reduced NLRP1 induction during BFA stimulation, suggesting that NLRP1 up-regulation caused by ER stress is due to transcriptional control and not to increased mRNA stability (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because XBP-1s and ATF4 are transcription factors generated downstream of IRE1Î± and PERK, we experimentally determined whether either ATF4 or XBP-1s overexpression is sufficient to induce NLRP1 mRNA transcription. Using murine versions of cDNAs encoding these transcription factors to discriminate them from the endogenous human proteins, we infected HeLa cells with increasing doses of Atf4 or Xbp-1s adenovirus for 24 hours and then analyzed <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression by qPCR. We found that murine Atf4 overexpression was sufficient to stimulate NLRP1 mRNA increases in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, murine Xbp-1s overexpressionâalthough able to induce human <italic>ERdj4</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>)âdid not affect NLRP1 mRNA levels, suggesting that IRE1Î±âs contributions to NLRP1 expression may involve other downstream components of IRE1Î± signaling other than XBP-1s. This possibility was also supported by the lower levels of NLRP1 mRNA up-regulation that are mediated by Atf4 adenovirus compared to BFA induction (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), suggesting that ATF4 may be acting in concert with other transcription factors. It is also possible that phosphorylation, acetylation or other post-translational modifications of ATF4 or other transcription factors are required for their full effects on <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression.</p>

        <p>Although Xbp-1s alone was insufficient to induce NLRP1 expression in HeLa cells, we wondered whether it was necessary for NLRP1 induction by depleting XBP-1s using siRNA (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Down-regulation of XBP-1s expression, in contrast to IRE1Î± reduction, did not affect NLRP1 induction mediated by BFA, confirming that other factors controlled by IRE1Î± activation are required for stimulating <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Collectively, these results showed that XBP-1s is neither sufficient nor necessary for <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene induction.

        <p>We next focused on the genomic locus corresponding to the promoter of the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene and inserted this region into a plasmid containing a luciferase reporter gene. We also generated four different shorter <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter constructs (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) to localize the crucial region that could be responsible for ER stress responsiveness.

In contrast, a remarkable induction was measured after ER stress caused by BFA (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Similar differences between untreated versus BFA treated samples were detected using shorter promoter constructs, in particular with the reporter vectors carrying 2000 and 1500bp segments from the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter. Notably, upon transfection with a 1000bp segment of the <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter, we observed &gt; 70% reduction of the luciferase signal compared to plasmids expressing longer promoter sequences, suggesting that the <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter region between 1500bp and 1000bp upstream of the ATG (green rectangle, <xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) contains a critical ER stress-dependent responsive element. In contrast, while a luciferase reporter construct containing 1000bp upstream of the translation start site retained some ER stress induction (~30% relative to 2000bp construct), no ER stress-inducible luciferase activity was detected using a 500bp luciferase vector, which corresponds to the 5â²UTR region (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

        <p>Since ATF4 overexpression was sufficient to induce <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression, we sought to determine whether ATF4 directly regulates NLRP1 expression. Han <italic>et al</italic>. recently used chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to perform an exhaustive analysis of mouse genes that are regulated by Atf4 during ER stress[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although this study did not identify any significant Atf4 sequencing peak in the promoter regions of mouse <italic>Nlrp1a</italic>, <italic>Nlrp1b</italic> or <italic>Nlrp1c</italic>, we decided to re-analyze their ChIP-seq raw data with the publicly available next-generation sequencing analysis software HOMER[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and confirmed the Atf4 binding motif identified by the nucleotide sequence: TT-A/G-CATCA (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, we searched the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter region for the presence of an Atf4 consensus site. Interestingly, we found only one match in the middle of the region that we identified as containing a putative ER stress-responsive element (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). We therefore used a mutagenesis approach to modify three nucleotides of the Atf4 binding motif in the luciferase vector carrying a 2500bp segment from the <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter. When HeLa cells were transfected with the wild-type or ATF4 consensus mutant luciferase vectors, a significant reduction in the luciferase signal was observed in cells transfected with the mutated <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter as compared to cells carrying the wild-type promoter following ER stress induction by BFA (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm these data, we generated a HeLa <italic>ATF4</italic> knock-out cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). ER stress-mediated luciferase induction of the 1500bp <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter region was significantly reduced in <italic>ATF4</italic>
<sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> HeLa cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). In contrast, the residual luciferase activity induced by ER stress using the 1000bp of <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter was unaffected by loss of ATF4 (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). These data thus identify ATF4 transcription factor as an activator of <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene during ER stress conditions.</p>
        <p>To extend the analysis of ATF4 effects on <italic>NLRP1</italic> expression, we performed ChIP experiments to study stimulation-dependent binding of the ATF4 transcription factor to the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter. Consistent with our previous experiments, we observed substantial recruitment of ATF4 to the <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter only upon BFA treatment, while no <italic>NLRP1</italic> DNA enrichment was detected in the negative IgG control (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>âleft panel). Under the same ER stress conditions, we observed ATF4 binding to the <italic>ATF3</italic> promoter region, which was used as a positive control (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>âright panel).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that upon ER stress the ATF4 transcription factor binds and activates the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter. Other transcription factors or other signaling mechanisms, particularly those acting downstream of IRE1Î±, may also contribute to <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression during ER stress and they are currently under investigation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Multiple members of the NLR family are capable of forming so-called âinflammasomesâ, which are multi-protein complexes that recruit and activate pro-inflammatory caspases and stimulate proteolytic activation of cytokines such as Interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and Interleukin-18 (IL-18). Prior studies have recently demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to ER stress conditions[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, we present the first evidence that expression of the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to perturbations of the ER. The human NLRP1 protein is also capable of forming inflammasomes that stimulate caspase-1 activation and processing of pro-IL-1Î²[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, hereditary polymorphisms in the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene have been associated with vitiligo, autoimmunity, systemic sclerosis, and increases sensitivity of leprosy[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
      <p>We showed that both the IRE1Î± and PERK pathways are important for ER stress-induced <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression. Indeed, we demonstrated that ATF4 transcription factor (which is produced downstream of PERK) binds and stimulates the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> promoter upon ER stress induction. Other transcription factors downstream of the IRE1Î±-TRAF2 pathway, such as <italic>RELB</italic> and <italic>NFKB1</italic>, may also be involved in this process and they are currently under investigation. In contrast, XBP-1s (the best-studied transcription factor produced by IRE1Î±-mediated mRNA splicing during the initial restorative phase of the UPR) did not participate in NLRP1 regulation, even though it has been described to play a role in inflammatory responses[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This finding, together with the observation that NLRP1 expression is induced at later times compared to XBP-1 splicing (<xref rid="pone.0130635.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), suggest that <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression is stimulated during the terminal phase of the UPR.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we observed NLRP1 up-regulation in many different cell lines in which one or more components of the inflammasomes, such as NLRP3 or the adaptor protein ASC, are not expressed (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) and are not induced during ER stress (data not shown). Together with the observation that most of these cell lines also do not express or up-regulate following ER stress the pro-forms of IL-1Î² or IL-18, this finding strongly suggests that NLRP1 function during ER stress is not related to pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion but presumably to other functions such as caspases activation. In this regard, NLRP1 was initially described to be involved in apoptosis[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, the NLRP1-interacting human proteins caspase-4 and caspase-5[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have been shown to become activated during ER stress[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130635.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and were more recently implicated in cell death induced in response to intracellular bacterial components[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Whether the human NLRP1 inflammasome is also involved in ER stress-dependent caspase-4/5 activation and cell death in response to bacterial infections is currently under investigation. Additionally, ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain (which is a known cause of ER stress) has been shown to cause increases in NLRP1 expression under conditions where caspase-1 inhibitors show neuroprotective activity[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
      <p>ATF4 is a member of the ATF/CREB (activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP response element binding protein) family of basic region-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Notably, the transcription factor CREB has been described to induce NLRP1 expression in leukemia cells[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, we did not observe any NLRP1 mRNA induction in HeLa cells upon treatment with the CREB activator forskolin (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A Fig</xref>). In addition, specific siRNA against <italic>CREB1</italic> gene did not affect NLRP1 mRNA induction by BFA (<xref rid="pone.0130635.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8B Fig</xref>), suggesting that CREB does not play a role in human <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene induction during ER stress conditions.</p>
      <p>Genomic variations in the NLR family genes are extensive among mammalian species, suggesting that specialization of these innate immunity genes has occurred during evolution to adapt to differences in the pathogens that various species encounter in their environmental niches. In this regard, the closest analog of the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene in mice is a cluster of genes that vary among mouse strains in the proteins they encode and that lack the N-terminal PYRIN domain found in the human NLRP1 protein[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Whether the murine gene locus showing homology to human <italic>NLRP1</italic> is also subject to regulation by ER stress remains to be determined, however, a murine genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis failed to reveal ATF4 binding sites[<xref rid="pone.0130635.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the human <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene is up-regulated during severe ER stress conditions. Furthermore, we clarified a portion of the underlying mechanism, which involves direct binding of transcription factor ATF4 to the <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene promoter. Future efforts will be directed to identifying the mechanisms by which the IRE1Î± pathway also makes contributions to ER stress-induced <italic>NLRP1</italic> gene expression and to understanding the roles played by the NLRP1 protein in the context of ER stress conditions.</p>
