        <p>The cascade of phosphorylation is a pivotal event in transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) signaling. Reversible phosphorylation regulates fundamental aspects of cell activity. TGFÎ²-induced Smad7 binds to type I receptor (TGFÎ² type I receptor; TÎ²RI) functioning as a receptor kinase antagonist. We found Smad7 interacts with growth arrest and DNA damage protein, GADD34, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holoenzyme, which subsequently recruits catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c) to dephosphorylate TÎ²RI. Blocking Smad7 expression by RNA interference inhibits association of GADD34âPP1c complex with TÎ²RI, indicating Smad7 acts as an adaptor protein in the formation of the PP1 holoenzyme that targets TÎ²RI for dephosphorylation. SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) enhances the recruitment PP1c to the Smad7âGADD34 complex by controlling the specific subcellular localization of PP1c. Importantly, GADD34âPP1c recruited by Smad7 inhibits TGFÎ²-induced cell cycle arrest and mediates TGFÎ² resistance in responding to UV light irradiation. The dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI mediated by Smad7 is an effective mechanism for governing negative feedback in TGFÎ² signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>TGFÎ² superfamily members regulate cell fate by controlling proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and are therefore crucial for the development and maintenance of many different tissues (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Derynck, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heldin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kretzschmar and Massague, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Miyazono, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>). Deregulated TGFÎ² family signaling has been implicated in various human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, vascular disorders, and cancers (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Derynck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>). TGFÎ² superfamily members elicit their cellular response through ligand-induced formation of heteromeric complexes of specific transmembrane types I and II kinase receptors. The type II receptor is a constitutively active kinase, which upon ligand-mediated heteromeric complex formation phosphorylates particular serine and threonine residues in the type I receptor juxtamembrane region (GS domain; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wieser et al., 1995</xref>), resulting in the activation of the type I receptor (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wrana et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">1994a</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Franzen et al., 1993</xref>). The activated type I receptor then transiently associates with and phosphorylates a subclass of a unique family of intracellular signaling molecules called Smad proteins. This subclass of Smads are receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heldin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kretzschmar and Massague, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>). Once phosphorylated by activated type I receptor at their COOH-terminal SSXS motif, R-Smads rapidly dissociate from the receptor to form complexes with common partner Smad, Smad4, and migrate into the nucleus where they regulate transcription of target genes (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Derynck, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heldin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>). Thus, the activity of this pathway is tightly controlled by serine/threonine phosphorylation, which plays a key role in regulating proteinâprotein interactions that are critical in the elaboration of signaling responses (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Derynck, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heldin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Miyazono, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>With no exception, the phosphorylation state of cellular proteins is controlled by the opposing actions of protein kinases and phosphatases. There are two kinds of kinase/phosphatase in the mammalian system: protein tyrosine kinase/protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and serine threonine kinase/protein phosphatase (PP). Receptor protein tyrosine kinases are all type I transmembrane proteins with a cytoplasmic domain that has an intrinsic catalytic activity activated upon ligand binding. These phosphorylated substrates can hence be dephosphorylated by certain PTPs (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Egloff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bollen, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2002</xref>). Mammalian members of the receptor serine threonine kinase family are receptors for ligands of TGFÎ² family. The counterpart of PTP here is protein phosphatase (PP), but no protein phosphatase was found directly involved in the dephosphorylation of major components in the TGFÎ² signaling pathway.</p>
      <p>Here we show that Smad7, an inhibitory Smad whose expression is induced by TGFÎ² (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nakao et al., 1997</xref>), interacts with growth arrest and DNA damage protein (GADD34; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hollander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liebermann and Hoffman, 2002</xref>), a regulatory/targeting subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holoenzyme (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Egloff et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aggen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bollen, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2002</xref>). The catalytic subunit of PP1, PP1c, is recruited to TFGÎ² type I receptor (TÎ²RI)âSmad7âGADD34 complex through this regulatory subunit, GADD34, to dephosphorylate TÎ²RI. Furthermore, GADD34 is induced by UV light irradiation along with Smad7 resulting UV lightâinduced TGFÎ² resistance in Mv1Lu cells. Blockage of GADD34 and Smad7 by RNA interference (RNAi) restores the resistance to TGFÎ². Together, these results indicate that the formation of PP1 holoenzyme mediated by TGFÎ²-induced Smad7 functions as a negative feedback in TGFÎ² signaling pathway by dephosphorylating TÎ²RI. This implies an important mechanism by which TGFÎ² regulates the development, maintenance, and tumorigenesis of different tissues.</p>

        <title>GADD34 functions as a Smad7-interacting protein through its central repeats</title>
        <p>Although the phosphorylation cascade of TGFÎ² signaling is well characterized, little is known about the negative regulatory mechanism by phosphatases. To investigate the possible dephosphorylation mechanism of TGFÎ² signaling, we used the full length of Smad7 cDNA as a bait to screen a human chondrocyte cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. Sequence analysis revealed that two of the positive clones were GADD34 and that both clones contain the GADD34 central repeat region (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hollander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liebermann and Hoffman, 2002</xref>; and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). Î²-Galactosidase liquid assays showed that Smad7 interacts with full-length GADD34, suggesting that the GADD34 central repeats mediate the interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a).</p>

        <p>Flag-tagged Smad7 was then cotransfected with HA-tagged GADD34 in COS1 cells to confirm the interaction in mammalian cells. The cell lysate was subjected to Smad7 immunoprecipitation and the associated GADD34 was immunoblotted. Conversely, GADD34 was immunoprecipitated and Smad7 was immunoblotted. The results showed that Smad7 coprecipitated with GADD34 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>). The interaction was further confirmed with endogenous Smad7 and GADD34 and TGFÎ² significantly enhanced the interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, d and e</xref>). This is likely a result of TGFÎ²-induced Smad7 transcription (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nakao et al., 1997</xref>). To verify that GADD34 central repeats mediate the interaction, a series of truncated GADD34 plasmids were generated in both yeast two-hybrid and mammalian expression vectors. Consistent with library screen results, deletion of the GADD34 multiple 34âaa repeats abolished its interaction with Smad7 and a single repeat was not sufficient to mediate the interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> f). Immunoprecipitation assays with the same deletion constructs indicated that the GADD34 multiple 34âaa repeat mediates the interaction with Smad7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>, last lanes, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> g).</p>

        <title>TGFÎ² regulates the formation of TÎ²RIâSmad7âGADD34 complex via Smad7</title>
        <p>Because Smad7 acts as an antagonist in the TGFÎ² signaling pathway by binding to the TÎ²RI (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wrana et al., 1994a</xref>,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wieser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Feng and Derynck, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>), and GADD34 is a targeting subunit of PP1 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hollander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liebermann and Hoffman, 2002</xref>), the interaction of Smad7 with GADD34 implicates a negative regulatory mechanism via the dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI. Recent studies have revealed that PP1 negatively regulates decapentaplegic signaling in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by affecting the phosphorylation state of TÎ²RI (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Alphey, 2002</xref>). We therefore examined whether TGFÎ² mediates the binding of GADD34âPP1c serine/threonine phosphatase to its substrate, TÎ²RI, because GADD34 is a target regulatory subunit of the PP1 holoenzyme. First, we examined whether GADD34 forms complexes with TÎ²RI and Smad7 in mammalian cells. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed in TGFÎ²-responsive MvlLu cells treated with or without TGFÎ²-1. TGFÎ²-induced endogenous TÎ²RIâSmad7âGADD34 complexes were immunoprecipitated with either anti-TÎ²RI or anti-GADD34 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, a and b). This complex is further confirmed by a sequential immunoprecipitation. COS1 cells were first cotransfected with TÎ²RIâHA and PP1c with or without FlagâSmad7 and GADD34. After 2 h of stimulation with TGFÎ²-1, the cells were lysed, subjected to first immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody, and the resultant precipitates were eluted from the protein GâSepharose bead by Flag peptide competition and then subjected to second immunoprecipitation with HA antibody. The final precipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies against all these components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c). The results indicated that the triple components complex, Smad7âTÎ²RIâGADD34, were formed along with PP1c. To identify the region of Smad7 that binds GADD34, a series of truncated Smad7 truncation constructs were generated for a yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> d). The results indicate that the COOH terminus is responsible for the binding of Smad7 to GADD34. Immunoprecipitation experiments further corroborate the mapping results from yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> e). Together, the results demonstrate that TÎ²RI forms complexes with GADD34 and that TGFÎ² enhances this interaction via Smad7, whose expression induced by TGFÎ² enhances the complex formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, a and b).</p>

        <title>Smad7 regulates recruitment of PP1c to Smad7âTÎ²RIâGADD34 complex</title>
        <p>As a catalytic subunit of PP1, PP1c is recruited to GADD34âSmad7âTÎ²RI based on the sequential immunoprecipitation result (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c). We then investigated how this recruitment is regulated. MvlLu cells were treated with or without TGFÎ²-1. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TÎ²RI antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-PP1, anti-GADD34, and anti-Smad7 antibodies. Conversely, lysates were immunoprecipiated with anti-PP1c antibody and immunoblotted with anti-TÎ²RI, anti-GADD34, and anti-Smad7 antibodies. The results demonstrate that PP1 coprecipitates with the triple complex and that TGFÎ² enhances the coprecipitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, a and b). To determine whether TGFÎ² regulates the interaction through Smad7, we blocked Smad7 expression with Smad7 small interface RNA (siRNA; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hannon, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">McManus and Sharp, 2002</xref>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> c shows that blocking of Smad7 expression inhibits the recruitment of PP1c to the complex.

        <p>Furthermore, we examined the potential dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI by Smad7-recruited PP1 complex.

        <title>Regulation of PP1c intracellular localization close to Smad7âGADD34 complex by Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA)</title>
        <p>While pursuing the potential role of PP1c in TÎ²RI signaling, Bennett and Alphey reported that PP1c binds to SARA and negatively regulates decapentaplegic signaling (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tsukazaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Alphey, 2002</xref>). Expression of dominant-negative SARA with a mutation in the PP1c-binding domain (F678A) resulted in hyperphosphorylation of the type I receptor and stimulated expression of a TGFÎ² signaling target (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Alphey, 2002</xref>). SARA is known to recruit R-Smads to the TGFÎ² receptor by controlling the subcellular localization of R-Smads and by interacting with the TÎ²RI complex (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tsukazaki et al., 1998</xref>). It also functions as an anchor for PP1c via its PP1c-binding motif (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Alphey, 2002</xref>). We first examined whether SARAâPP1c complex is able to dephosphorylate TÎ²RI directly. Purified GSTâTÎ²RIâ<sup>32</sup>P was incubated with anti-Flag immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with FlagâGADD34, FlagâSARA, or FlagâGADD34 with mammalian dominant-negative SARA (F728A) in combination with PP1c and Smad7. SARAâPP1c complex did not show significant dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI in comparison to control and Smad7âGADD34âPP1c complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> a, lanes 1â3). These results suggest that SARA is not likely a targeting subunit for directing the PP1 holoenzyme to dephosphorylate TÎ²RI, as PP1c exhibits phosphatase activity only when it binds to its appropriate targeting subunit for specific substrate. Moreover, overexpression of dominant-negative SARA with mutation of PP1c-binding domain inhibits GADD34 complexâmediated dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, a and b, lane 4) indicating that SARA is likely a membrane anchor protein for PP1c. To investigate the potential role of SARA in recruitment of PP1c to the GADD34 complex, both wild-type and dominant-negative SARA were transfected into COS1 cells. As expected, the amount of PP1c in the complex was increased by addition of wild-type SARA and decreased by addition of dominant-negative SARA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> c). Together, these results suggest that PP1c is handed over to the targeting subunit GADD34 through SARA. In an in vivo phosphatase assay similar to experiment in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c, the effect of SARA on TÎ²RI dephosphorylation was examined. Dominant-negative SARA suppressed the dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, d and e</xref>). SARA appears to facilitate the dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI in the Smad7-negative feedback loop by controlling the specific subcellular localization of PP1c.</p>

        <title>GADD34âPP1c recruited by Smad7 inhibits TGFÎ²-induced cell cycle arrest and mediates TGFÎ² resistance</title>
        <p>Finally, we attempted to characterize cellular function GADD34âPP1c in TGFÎ² signaling. First, we examined the effects of dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI on TGFÎ²-induced gene transactivation. A TGFÎ²-responsive p3TP luciferase reporter construct was cotransfected into Mv1Lu cells with Smad7, GADD34, PP1, and/or dominant-negative SARA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> a). As expected, GADD34 or Smad7 alone inhibited TGFÎ²-induced transcription activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> a, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, transactivation was almost completely blocked when Smad7 was coexpressed with either GADD34 or GADD34 and PP1c or GADD34 and SARA, whereas dominant-negative GADD34, Smad7, and SARA or OA reversed the SmadâGADD34-mediated inhibition to varying extents. As we know, TGFÎ² induces epithelial cell cycle arrest. GADD34âPP1c could inhibit such effect because the complex negatively regulates TGFÎ²-induced gene transcription. We then examined the effect of GADD34âPP1c complex on TGFÎ²-induced epithelium cell cycle arrest. Cells were cotransfected with Smad7, GADD34, PP1, and/or dominant-negative SARA as luciferase assay; GFP was also cotransfected for sorting the transfected cells. After treatment as indicated, cells were first sorted for cotransfected GFP and then DNA contents were quantified by FACS<sup>Â®</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b). These results indicate that GADD34âPP1c inhibits TGFÎ²-induced epithelium cell cycle arrest.</p>

        <p>Considering GADD34 is a growth-arrested and DNA-damaged protein induced by different stresses, such as UV light and unfolded proteins, its involvement in here proposed complex implies that the regulation of TGFÎ² signaling by this PP1 complex may play an important role in stress-induced cell response. Interestingly, GADD34 and Smad7 expression can simultaneously be induced by UV light irradiation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hollander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Quan et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, UV light irradiationâinduced Smad7 is responsible for TGFÎ² resistance in the UV lightâirradiated cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Quan et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore examined whether the resistance to TGFÎ² is correlated with the induction of GADD34 and Smad7. We first transfected the cells with the constructs, including siRNA against Smad7 and GADD34, as indicated, and then exposed the cell to UV light to induce the GADD34 and Smad7 expression, which will cause TGFÎ² resistance in irradiated cells. Our luciferase assay indicates Smad7 and GADD34 are involved in TGFÎ² resistance in responding to UV light irradiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> c) and that blockade of UV lightâenhanced expression of GADD34 restores UV lightâinhibited Smad2 nuclear translocation and downstream PAI-1 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> d).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Precise control of cascade amplification of phosphorylation from receptor to R-Smad is a crucial component of the TGFÎ² signaling pathway (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wrana et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">1994a</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wieser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abdollah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heldin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Attisano and Wrana, 2002</xref>). Here, we proposed a novel mechanism of Smad7-mediated dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI. We first found Smad7 interacts with GADD34, a regulatory/targeting subunit of PP1 holoenzyme, and demonstrated the existence of an endogenous TÎ²RIâSmad7âGADD34 triple complex, whose presence is regulated by TGFÎ² via its induction of Smad7. We then showed that this triple complex recruited a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase1 (PP1c). Both in vitro and in vivo dephosphorylation assays demonstrated that the PP1 holoenzyme dephosphorylates TÎ²RI, down-regulating the TGFÎ² signaling pathway. Smad7 acts as an adaptor protein for the formation of the complex and subsequent TÎ²RI dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI by Smad7-induced PP1c complex explains the central role that Smad7 plays in the negative feedback mechanism.</p>

      <p>SARA was originally known as a membrane-bound anchor protein for the recruitment of R-Smads and PP1c (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tsukazaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Alphey, 2002</xref>). Mutation in SARA's PP1c binding site (F728A) inhibited the recruitment of PP1c to the triple complex. Overexpression of wild-type SARA, however, enhanced the interaction of PP1c with the triple complex, consequently enhancing the dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI. Importantly, we also found that the SARAâPP1c complex is not able to dephosphorylate TÎ²RI directly. SARA is not a targeting subunit of PP1 to dephosphorylate TÎ²RI. GADD34 is the essential targeting subunit of the PP1 holoenzyme, directing PP1c-mediated TÎ²RI dephosphorylation. SARA appears to serve only as an anchor protein to enhance the availability of PP1c to GADD34 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). A previous study has shown that R-Smads interact with and are recruited by SARA, but once phosphorylated by TÎ²RI, they dissociate from SARA to form a complex with Smad4. So, phosphorylated R-Smad is not a component of this PP1 holoenzyme complex.</p>
      <p>It seems that there are three mechanisms by which Smad7 negatively regulates TGFÎ² signaling: (1) mechanical blockage of R-Smad's phosphorylation, (2) proteasomal degradation, and (3) dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI. Smad7 was initially found involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as shear stress in the vascular epithelium (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Topper et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ishisaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kleeff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nakao et al., 1999</xref>). It functions as an intracellular receptor antagonists by binding stably to activated TÎ²RI to prevent phosphorylation of R-Smads. The physical blocking of TÎ²RI requires the interaction between Smad7 and TÎ²RI, which is also the initial step of the PP1c complexâmediated dephosphorylation. This mechanism may explain why Smad7 binds to phosphorylated TÎ²RI with a much higher affinity than to dephosphorylated TÎ²RI. TGFÎ² ignites the phosphorylation TÎ²RI with subsequent signaling and induction of Smad7, which further initiates the formation of GADD34âPP1 complex for TÎ²RI dephosphorylation. Therefore, it is likely that the phosphorylation state of TÎ²RI regulates the interaction between Smad7 and TÎ²RI. So, dominant-negative GADD34 inhibits the dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI, which leads to a longer stable association of Smad7 with phosphorylated TÎ²RI, inhibiting TGFÎ² signaling. This could be the reason that dominant-negative GADD34 with an absent PP1c binding site appears not efficiently rescue the inhibition of TGFÎ² signaling in transcriptional response and cell cycle assays. This observation is further confirmed by the fact that the blocking of GADD34 expression by RNAi eliminates the effect of dnGADD34 in the UV light irradiation experiment. Physical blockage is only one step of Smad7 inhibition, and each Smad7 molecule can only inhibit one TÎ²RI receptor in the physical blockage model. Whereas, the involvement of PP1c dephosphorylation, Smad7 could inhibit TÎ²RI much more efficiently through enzymatic activity. In the third proteasome degradation mechanism, Smad7 was found to act as an adaptor protein to bind to Smurf2 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets TÎ²RI for its degradation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>). This is an irreversible and terminal destruction of TÎ²RI, a different level of regulation.</p>
      <p>Because cytokines such as interferon Î³ and TNFÎ± also induce Smad7 expression, and TÎ²RI is occasionally phosphorylated by constitutively active type II receptor (TÎ²RII; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ventura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1995</xref>) or other kinases in the absence of ligands (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Topper et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ulloa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Derynck, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bitzer et al., 2000</xref>), there is a basal level of induced Smad7 expression. Importantly, the interaction between ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 and Smad7 is induced by IFNÎ³. Therefore, the mechanism by which Smad7 targets TÎ²RI for degradation is important for the turnover of TÎ²RI and IFNÎ³-dependent inhibition of TGFÎ² signaling (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kavsak et al., 2000</xref>). Our data show this basal level Smad7 still mediates the recruitment of PP1 holoenzyme to minimize the background signaling initiated by random, promiscuous phosphorylation of TÎ²RI, which may in turn be important for maintenance of cell function. Taken together, these data imply that Smad7, in different cellular contexts, differentially regulates cellular activity by a preferential mechanism, although all three mechanisms may act simultaneously to contribute to the final response of the cell.</p>
      <p>GADD34 was initially reported to be induced by various types of cellular stress and DNA damage, such as UV light irradiation and unfolded proteins, and its function in overcoming a protein synthesis checkpoint is supported by the fact that the Î³(1)34.5 domain necessary for averting the total shutoff of protein synthesis in herpes simplex virusâinfected cells maps to the COOH-terminal domain of the Î³(1)34.5 protein. This region is highly homologous to the corresponding domains in MyD116 and GADD34 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, GADD34 has been implicated in the dephosphorylation of eIF2Î± in a negative feedback loop that inhibits stress-induced gene expression and that might promote recovery from translational inhibition in the unfolded protein response (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>). The involvement of GADD34 in our proposed complex implies that the regulation of TGFÎ² signaling by this PP1 complex may play an important role in stress-induced cell response. Interestingly, GADD34 and Smad7 expression can simultaneously be induced by UV light irradiation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hollander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Quan et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, cellular stress caused by UV light irradiation has been known to confer TGFÎ² resistance in Mv1Lu cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Quan et al., 2001</xref>). UV lightâinduced TGFÎ² resistance in Mv1Lu cells is likely attributable to up-regulated expressions of Smad7 and GADD34 and that disruption of this up-regulation will resensitize the cell to TGFÎ² signaling. Blocking expression of GADD34 and Smad7 with RNAi not only restored TGFÎ² signaling in UV lightâirradiated cells, but rescued the suppressed expression of downstream gene, PAI-1. Dephosphorylation of TÎ²RI by Smad7-mediated PP1 complex is a quick reversible mechanism and it plays a very important role in regulating TGFÎ² signaling in certain cellular context, such as cellular stress, DNA damage, and induced growth arrest, which further indicates the diversity of cell growth regulation under different cellular context. It will be of substantial interest to investigate the role of our proposed complex in the tumorigenesis of some TGFÎ²-resistant tumors, developmental events, and other TGFÎ²-mediated disorders.</p>

        <p>Cells transfected by LipofectAMINE (GIBCO BRL) were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (as described above for cell homogenization) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 Î¼M OA, and 50 mM sodium Î²-glycerophosphate). Lysates were immunoprecipiated by incubation with the appropriate antibodies, followed by adsorption to protein G Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF (Bio-Rad Laboratories) membrane, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Kit; Amersham Biosciences). For mapping the interaction domains between Smad7 and GADD34 in mammalian cells, a series of different deletion constructs were epitope tagged with Flag or HA and subcloned into pcDNA3. All immunoprecipitation and blotting antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: monoclonal antiâFlag M2 and antiâÎ²-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA (Babco), polyclonal anti-TÎ²RI (Genex Bioscience, Inc.), polyclonal goat anti-Smad7, polyclonal anti-GADD34, and monoclonal anti-PP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).</p>

        <p>To silence endogenous Smad7 and GADD34 expression, single-stranded 21-nt RNAs directed against Smad7 and GADD34 were chemically synthesized and purified (Ambion). The target sequences were 5â²-AGGUCACCACCAUCCCCACUU-3â² and 5â²-GUCAAUUUGCAGAUGGCCAUU-3â², respectively. siRNA duplexes were generated and transfected into cells using the Silencer<sup>TM</sup> siRNA transfection kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of transfected siRNA was kept constant by addition of scrambled dsRNA provided by the manufacturer.</p>

        <p>GST-TÎ²RI was purified from bacterial lysates by absorption to glutathioneâagarose beads as described elsewhere (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 1996</xref>). GSTâTÎ²RI beads were washed with phosphorylation buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF, 5 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 10 Î¼M ATP) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 Î¼g/ml antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). 50 Î¼Ci of [Î³<sup>32</sup>P]ATP was then added to the mixture and incubated for 20 min at 30Â°C with anti-HA precipitates of TÎ²RIIâHA-transfected cells and protein GâSepharose beads. The protein GâSepharose beads and particulate material were pelleted at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, washed again with dephosphorylation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.8 mM ATP), and incubated in the same buffer with different precipitates from cells transfected with the indicated genes in the presence or absence of 0.05 Î¼M recombinant PP1 catalytic subunit (Î³ isoform from rabbit; Sigma-Aldrich) or its inhibitors (1.0 Î¼M OA and 50 nM I-1; Sigma-Aldrich). Phosphorylation status was analyzed on an 8.5% SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiography. Phosphatase activity of the precipitates was determined by phosphorylation status of the supposed substrate, TÎ²RIâHA.</p>

        <p>36 h after transfection with different combination of genes, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free DME containing 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum, incubated in the same medium for 4 h, and then labeled with 1 mCi/ml [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer) for an additional 2 h at 37Â°C in the absence or presence of TGFÎ²-1. The cells were washed again with the same medium and incubated with regular DME/ 2% FBS for another 2 h with or without PP1 inhibitor treatment. The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. TÎ²RIâHA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA as described above. The resultant precipitates were separated by 8.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to Biomax <italic>M</italic>
<sub>r</sub> or MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). After autoradiographic analysis, dried gels were rehydrated with transfer buffer, and transferred onto PVDF membranes.

        <title>UV light irradiation</title>
        <p>Subconfluent cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight. The next morning, the media were removed and cells were covered with a thin layer of PBS and irradiated with UV light (20 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) using four FS24T12UVB-HO bulbs. A Kodacel filter was used to eliminate wavelengths below 290 nm (UVC). The irradiation intensity was monitored with an IL400A radiometer and a SED240/UVB/W photodetector (International Light). After irradiation, the PBS was replaced with the original media. Cellular viability 24 h after UV light irradiation was near 100% based on cell morphology and number. For luciferase assay, the day before UV light irradiation, cells were transfected with 3-TP luciferase reporter construct and TGFÎ²-1 (4 ng/ml) was added after UV light irradiation overnight before luciferase activity assay. siRNA was transfected the day before UV light irradiation.</p>

        <title>Immunolocalization</title>
        <p>After UV light irradiation and ligand stimulation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice in blocking buffer (10%BSA in PBS), and labeled with antibodies in PBS with 2% BSA. GADD34 was visualized by immunostaining with rabbit antibody against GADD34 (Santa Cruz) and goat antiârabbit Texas redâconjugated IgG (Amersham Biosciences). For Smad2 translocation observation, TGFÎ²-1 (4 ng/ml) was added for 2 h after UV light irradiation, and phosphorylated Smad2 was visualized by immunostaining with rabbit antibody against phosphorylated Smad2 at 465 and 467 residues (Biosource International) and goat antiârabbit fluorescein-conjugated IgG. For PAI-1 induction observation, immunostaining performed with antibodies (rabbit antiâPAI-1 from Santa Cruz; goat antiârabbit fluorescein-conjugated IgG from Amersham Biosciences) 24 h after UV light irradiation. Digital pictures were taken with an Olympus, IX TRINOC camera under Olympus, IX70 Inverted Research Microscope (Olympus) with objective lenses of Hoffman Modulation Contrast <sup>Â®</sup>, HMC 10 LWD PL FL, 0.3NA â/1, OPTICS INC at room temperature, and proceeded with MagnaFire<sup>Â®</sup> SP imaging software (Optronics).</p>
