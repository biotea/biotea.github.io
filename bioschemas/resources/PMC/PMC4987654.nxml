      <abstract>
        <p>Cellular exposure to hypoxia results in altered gene expression in a range of physiologic and pathophysiologic states. Discrete cohorts of genes can be either up- or down-regulated in response to hypoxia. While the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) is the primary driver of hypoxia-induced adaptive gene expression, less is known about the signalling mechanisms regulating hypoxia-dependent gene repression. Using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that equivalent numbers of genes are induced and repressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We demonstrate that nuclear localization of the Repressor Element 1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST) is induced in hypoxia and that REST is responsible for regulating approximately 20% of the hypoxia-repressed genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrate that REST-dependent gene repression is at least in part mediated by direct binding to the promoters of target genes. Based on these data, we propose that REST is a key mediator of gene repression in hypoxia.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Hypoxia is a feature of a range of physiological and pathophysiological conditions including embryonic development, exercise, cancer, ischemia and inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Throughout evolution, adaptive pathways have developed to help an organism cope with hypoxia. The best-described transcriptional adaptive response in cells is mediated by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signalling pathway, which up-regulates genes which restore oxygen and energy homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In normoxia, HIFÎ± is hydroxylated by the prolyl-hydroxylase domain (PHD) family of dioxygenases targeting it for ubiquitylation by the von Hipple Lindau E3 ligase complex and subsequent proteosomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. This process is reversed in hypoxia and HIFÎ± is stabilized, dimerises with HIFÎ² and binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) in the regulatory regions of target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. HIF drives an adaptive response to hypoxia by promoting the expression of genes that regulate erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and glycolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However in cancer, HIF signalling can be maladaptive and contribute to tumour survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>Microarray studies of mammalian cells exposed to hypoxia have shown that approximately the same numbers of genes are repressed and induced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. While HIF has been described as a master regulator of gene expression in hypoxia, a significant number of other transcription factors are also hypoxia-sensitive and control HIF-independent gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Microarray data combined with siRNA against HIF-1/-2 indicate that there are HIF-dependent and HIF-independent genes which are differentially expressed in hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. ChIP-seq and microarray data indicate that while HIF is enriched in the promoters of genes induced in a HIF-dependent way, it is not enriched in the promoters of genes that are repressed in hypoxia, thus indicating the presence of HIF-independent and/or indirectly HIF-dependent mechanisms governing gene repression in hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. While HIF is well known to regulate gene induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, the mechanisms underpinning transcriptional repression of genes in hypoxia remain poorly understood and is the topic of the current study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Transcriptional repressors are a large and diverse group of proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Mechanistically repressors can act by inhibiting the basal transcription machinery, ablation of activator function and remodelling of chromatin. They can be further classified into DNA-binding proteins (Class I) like KrÃ¼ppel zinc fingers, proteins that bind DNA-binding proteins (Class II) such as the DNA-methyltransferase Dnmt3, or proteins that target activators, reducing their activity, such as IÎºB that sequesters NFÎºB in the cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
    <p>The Repressor Element 1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) is a C2H2- or KrÃ¼ppel-type zinc finger, one of the largest classes of transcription factors in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It binds to the 21 base pair Repressor Element 1 (RE1) on the promoter of target genes and inhibits transcription by regulating chromatin structure or by inhibiting the basal transcriptional machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Proteosomal REST degradation is induced during neuronal differentiation, resulting in the promotion of the expression of the genes which confer the unique neuronal phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Thus, REST was initially regarded as a master regulator of neurogenesis and as the first example of a vertebrate transcription silencer protein that regulates a large repertoire of cell type-specific genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, REST has since being shown to be implicated in the regulation of non-neuronal biological processes in a variety of cell types, including cardiac myocytes, immune, vascular and tumour cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In the aging human brain, REST is induced to protect against oxidative stress and brain neurodegeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Of particular interest for our study, ischemia and/or oxygen-glucose deprivation have previously been shown to induce REST nuclear protein and mRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and to modulate the expression of target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Furthermore, we have recently shown that REST represses the HIF-1Î± mRNA expression and contributes to the resolution of the HIF response during prolonged hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. This led us to explore the global response of REST to cellular hypoxia, with the aim of developing our understanding of the signalling mechanisms underpinning hypoxia-dependent transcriptional repression.</p>
    <p>Using an unbiased, high-throughput approach combined with biochemical analysis, we demonstrate that REST accumulates in the nucleus of cells exposed to hypoxia and acts as a key repressor of the hypoxic transcriptome, regulating approximately 20% of the hypoxia-repressed genes. Furthermore, hypoxia leads to a change in the target gene repertoire of REST, from the repression of neuronal genes in normoxic/basal conditions, to the repression of metabolic, cell cycle and proliferation related genes in hypoxia. Together these findings indicate a previously unknown key role for the tumour suppressor REST in hypoxic signalling.</p>

        <title>High-throughput analysis of the transcriptional responses to hypoxia</title>
        <p>Previous microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of changes in global mRNA expression in response to hypoxia revealed that down-regulated genes reach their maximal repression following prolonged hypoxic exposure, while induced transcripts generally reach their maximum induction at earlier time-points<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Here we used human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 24âhours as a cell model to investigate the processes associated with gene repression. High-throughput sequencing of poly(A)+ RNA (RNA-Seq) was performed on samples collected and transcript analysis revealed the presence of almost 2000âgenes that were differentially expressed in hypoxia, with similar numbers of genes being induced (green; 851) and repressed (red; 1013) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These data are quantitatively consistent with previously published transcriptomic studies of human cells exposed to hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Importantly, cohorts of well-characterized hypoxia-induced genes were up regulated including <italic>LDHA, HK2, SLC2A1</italic>, <italic>EGLN1</italic> and <italic>BNIP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, a number of previously characterized hypoxia-repressed genes were present in the down-regulated cohort including <italic>RRS1</italic> (involved in ribosome biogenesis) and <italic>MTHFD1</italic> (involved in <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Therefore, hypoxia had comparable effects on global gene induction and repression in HEK293 cells.</p>
        <p>Using PANTHER ontological analysis, we classified hypoxia-induced and repressed genes according to gene ontology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/">http://www.pantherdb.org/</ext-link>). Our analysis revealed that hypoxia-induced and repressed genes could be associated with either similar or distinct processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>). For example, the glycolytic pathway, known previously to be induced in response to hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, was identified only on the list of hypoxia-induced metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1G</xref>) while genes encoding proteins associated with intercellular junctions were identified only in the hypoxia-repressed gene cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1F</xref>). Although both induced and repressed gene cohorts included genes involved in the regulation of transcription, metabolism and development, only the repressed cohort contained an overrepresentation of genes involved in mRNA processing and splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that hypoxia alters the expression of an equivalent number of increased and decreased genes which have both common and distinct roles in regulating cell responses.</p>

REST was initially identified as a regulator of neuronal gene expression, but was subsequently shown to have non-neuronal roles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Using publically available microarray datasets, we confirm that REST is extensively expressed in multiple tissue types and cell lines, being highly expressed in HEK293 cells used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). HEK293 cells have been instrumental for the discovery of various aspects of REST biology: transcriptional networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, phosphorylation and the proteasome system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and regulation of HIF-1Î± in hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Similar levels of REST could be detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm of normoxic HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>). In response to hypoxia, there was a more pronounced increase in REST levels in the nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>) than in either the cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>) or whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2F,G</xref>), suggesting nuclear accumulation as the major response of REST to hypoxia. This nuclear accumulation was also observed in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>). We investigated the effect of re-oxygenation on nuclear REST levels, and found that accumulation in hypoxia was reversible within one hour of re-oxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2H</xref>), strongly supporting an oxygen-regulated post-translational control mechanism of REST cellular localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back.</p>
        <p>The increase in nuclear REST protein was associated with an increase in REST-dependent repressor activity, as measured using by a repressor element-1 (RE1)-luciferase assay developed to measure REST transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S5</xref>). REST mRNA expression during hypoxic exposure was modestly and transiently increased, and was statistically significant only at the 2âhours time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2J</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assess the effect of hypoxia on REST protein stability, HEK293 cells were exposed to 24âhours of either normoxia (21% oxygen) or hypoxia (1% oxygen), followed by cycloheximide treatment in normoxia and protein stability was monitored by western blot. REST displayed a long half-life that was not increased by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figures S6A,B</xref>). In contrast, HIF-1Î± in the same cells exhibited a short half-life, with hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1Î± being completely degraded within 1âhour of culture in normoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S6C</xref>). Î²-Actin exhibited a long half-life that was also not affected by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S6D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results suggest that hypoxia leads to REST nuclear translocation, through a post-translational oxygen regulated mechanism, with a modest increase in transcription and, unlike HIF, independent of altered protein stability.</p>

        <title>Role of REST in basal gene expression in hypoxia</title>
        <p>The observation that nuclear REST expression and activity are increased led us to hypothesize that REST may play a broad role in regulating gene repression in hypoxia. To address this, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of hypoxic cells in the presence of scrambled or REST-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). An overview of the different steps performed to identify differentially expressed genes is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S7A</xref>. All quality control checks are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figures S7BâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S8</xref>. As described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), a cohort of known hypoxia-inducible genes served as positive experimental controls. REST-RNAi treatment led to a decrease in REST mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S9A</xref>) and protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9B,C</xref>) and a resultant increase in a number of previously identified REST target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> in 21% oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>), thus validating the effectiveness of the REST-RNAi knockdown.</p>
        <p>Among the genes whose basal expression was reduced in hypoxia (1013 genes represented by blue and red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>), 201 (~20%) were found to be REST-Dependent (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>), i.e. they were not significantly repressed by hypoxia when REST was silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). On the other hand, 812âgenes repressed in hypoxia were found to be REST-Independent, suggesting alternative gene regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). An ontological and clustering analysis of the hypoxia-repressed genes showed that metabolic processes and other energy demanding processes including transcription, proliferation and cell cycle were heavily over-represented in the cohort repressed in a hypoxia and REST-Dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). Analysis of cell death in hypoxic cells treated with RNAi targeting REST did not reveal any effect of REST on cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S10</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that REST is an important transcriptional repressor in hypoxia, whose major function is beyond the control of cell survival in hypoxia.</p>

        <title>REST regulates specific gene cohorts in normoxia and hypoxia by direct binding to gene promoters</title>
        <p>Comparison of the REST-dependent genes repressed in hypoxia to the REST-Dependent genes repressed in normoxia revealed a limited overlap (5âgenes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S3</xref>). Ontological analysis revealed well characterised neuronal genes regulated by REST in normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> black circle and 4B). A different subset of genes were found for REST-repressed genes in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> red circle and 4C), with ontological analysis showing an enrichment for metabolic and cell adhesion processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Among the 10âgenes most sensitive to REST regulation in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), <italic>RAB3C</italic> (encoding for RAB3C GTPase), is predicted to be regulated by REST in normoxia and hypoxia, while <italic>CYP1B1</italic> (encoding for cytochrome P450 1B1) is predicted to be regulated only in hypoxia. Using qRT-PCR we tested and validated these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). 29 genes were further induced by REST siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Together, these results indicate that hypoxia leads to the recruitment of REST to a largely different set of genes from those regulated by REST in normoxia. We tested a further group of 6âgenes for their regulation by REST in hypoxia. While we observed a similar trend in the rescue of repression by siREST, only 1âgene, <italic>GANAB</italic> (encoding for the neutral alpha-glucosidase AB in the glycan metabolism pathway) was significantly de-repressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S11</xref>). Overall, we confirmed that 3 out of 8âgenes were bona fide REST target genes in hypoxia, from which so we could assume a similar percentage of the 201 newly identified REST target genes in hypoxia to be similarly genuine (38%, about 75âgenes).</p>
        <p>In order to test if the REST regulation of hypoxia repressed gene is direct or indirect, we searched for the consensus RE1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>) in the region from â2 kilobase pairs to +1âkilobase pairs from the transcription start site in the cohort of genes repressed by REST in hypoxia. In this search, we found high stringency consensus RE1 sites in just 12âgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B,C</xref>). This indicates that, in the majority of cases, REST is binding to distant or non-consensus sites. ChIP assays were performed to validate REST binding to the RE1 site on the promoters of <italic>SYNJ1</italic> (encoding for synaptojanin 1) and <italic>GANAB</italic>, two of the identified REST target genes in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B,D</xref>). For both <italic>SYNJ1</italic> and <italic>GANAB</italic>, we detected REST binding to their promoters in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). For SYNJ1, we could observe a significant recruitment of REST in hypoxia over normoxia. We have also investigated whether the hypoxic REST-repressed genes from our RNA-seq are similar to published REST ChIP-Seq datasets from 4 different cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We found that, out of our list of 201âgenes identified as REST-repressed in hypoxia, 36 were also REST target genes from the published ChIP-sequencing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). This probably is still an under-estimation as there are no publically available REST ChIP-seq data performed on hypoxic cells.</p>
        <p>Thus our unbiased approach using RNA-Seq revealed a previously unknown aspect of REST repression and identifies an extensive repertoire of genes regulated by REST in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), providing new insight into the mechanisms of gene repression in hypoxia.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>While HIF is considered to be the master regulator of increased gene expression in hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, the mechanisms of transcriptional repression in hypoxia are poorly understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Our current study identifies REST as a key negative regulator of gene expression in hypoxia. We show it accumulates in the nucleus in response to hypoxia, and is responsible for the repression of approximately 20% of genes downregulated in hypoxia, thus acting as a counter-regulator to HIF-dependent gene expression.</p>
      <p>REST is a phosphoprotein whose protein stability is tightly regulated during development. REST levels are reduced during neuronal development to allow the expression of REST target genes, while outside the nervous system, REST levels remain high to repress neuronal specific genes outside the nervous systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. REST protein was stabilised in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of ischemia (typically 10 to 30âminutes of glucose/oxygen deprivation followed by re-oxygenation, typically for 24âhours) due to an inhibition of its degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Our pulse-chase experiments with cycloheximide showed that hypoxia did not affect the stability of REST. Instead, there was increased nuclear localisation. We also noticed that nuclear REST seemed to run at a smaller size. As REST is known to be phosphorylated and ubiquitylated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, it is possible that post-translational modifications also control its translocation to the nucleus.</p>
      <p>Our experiments using REST siRNA in normoxic cells show that, in the basal state, only 164âgenes of the detected normoxic transcriptome (23,284âgenes) are repressed by REST (equivalent to approximately 0.7% of the total transcriptome detected). Of the total of genes repressed in hypoxia (1013), we found that 201âgene are significantly repressed by REST in hypoxia (equivalent to approximately 20% of the total), placing REST as a significant repressor of gene expression in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Using qRT-PCR, we had a 38% validation rate, suggesting about 75 of the 201âgenes are expected to be <italic>bona fide</italic> REST targets in hypoxia. Furthermore, we found a small overlap (5âgenes) between the REST-dependent genes in normoxia compared with the REST-dependent genes in hypoxia, indicating that REST regulates context-specific transcriptional networks. This has been previously described in other systems: for example REST was shown to regulate different target genes in neuronal stem cells versus embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, embryonic stem cells vs epiblast stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and in response to ischemia in hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The factors leading to this differential recruitment are only starting to be uncovered, and may involve different co-factors, e.g. mSin3A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and differences in the REST binding sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. When we compared our normoxic/hypoxic REST target genes dataset with published ChIP-seq datasets, we found similarities of about 64% with the normoxic genes and 18% with the hypoxic genes. This difference in proportions could be due to REST in hypoxia regulating more genes indirectly than by direct binding. This simple analysis reveals that there are layers of regulations in the control of gene expression and could open new research avenues into direct and indirect REST regulation.</p>
      <p>Our ChIP and qRT-PCR experiments reveal two distinct binding patterns in 2 identified REST target genes <italic>SYNJ1</italic> and <italic>GANAB</italic>. While REST was bound to both of their promoters in normoxia, we observed significant increased binding of REST to only the <italic>SYNJ1</italic> promoter in hypoxia. We propose that, while REST recruitment is correlated to gene repression in hypoxia for some REST target genes (e.g. <italic>SYNJ1</italic>), for other genes (e.g. <italic>GANAB</italic>) REST might be already bound to the target gene in a low affinity state, âpoised to act,â with its repressive activity triggered only in hypoxia, possibly by co-factor recruitment. This is similar to the findings of Otto and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, which show that many of their identified REST target genes were still expressed while others were repressed, potentially due to their functional relevance to the cell. Interestingly <italic>SYNJ1</italic> encodes for synaptojanin, a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It could be speculated that this ATP-intensive process is marked for repression as soon as cellular levels of ATP become scarce.</p>
      <p>Our RNA-seq experiment was performed on cells in hypoxia for 24âhours (to maximise gene repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and we did not observe as dramatic an increase in HIF and its target genes as what we have previously reported in cells exposed to 8âhours of hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Thus our experiments demonstrate the temporal nature of HIF signalling and its tight regulation by multiple transcription factors such as REST, NFÎºB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (which promotes <italic>HIF1A</italic> mRNA expression), or miR-155<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> (which de-stabilizes <italic>HIF1A</italic>). Of note, our previous study showed that NFkB is recruited to the <italic>HIF1A</italic> promoter with maximal binding at 8âhours in hypoxia and back to normoxic level after 24âhours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It is thus possible that in the absence of REST (the repressor), we see increased <italic>HIF1A</italic> mRNA at 8âhours, but not at 24âhours, because one of the activators NFÎºB is less bound, or less active at this particular time point. The HIF signalling network is ripe for mathematical modelling to unravel its regulatory pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>
      <p>Gene ontology analysis suggests that REST plays an important role in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia by supressing genes involved in proliferation (<italic>DLX5, PRKCB</italic> and <italic>MET</italic>), cell cycle progression (<italic>TBX3, CABLES1, ARID3A</italic> and <italic>ARAP1</italic>) and transcription, with transcription factors (TF) (<italic>TCF12</italic> and <italic>LBX1</italic>), regulators of TF activity (<italic>MYCBP</italic> and <italic>ATF7IP</italic>) and general transcription apparatus (<italic>MMS19, CDK19</italic> and <italic>MED12</italic>), consistent with our hypothesis that direct and indirect mechanisms contribute to REST gene repression in hypoxia. In addition REST also seems to regulate important metabolic processes including the biosynthesis of lipids (<italic>MBOAT2, GPAM, PIGN</italic>, <italic>AGPS</italic> and <italic>ACACA</italic>) and nucleic acids (<italic>PARP4, SKIV2L2, PLRG1 and DHX37</italic>). Interestingly REST also represses genes involved in protein catabolism (<italic>FBXO18, NEDD4</italic>, <italic>ERLIN2</italic> and <italic>TRIP12</italic>). Our own ChIP experiments confirmed the hypoxic regulation of SYJN1 encoding synaptojanin 1, a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus repressing ATP-intensive processes in hypoxia is a plausible function for REST. Our lab has also shown a role for REST in the regulation of HIF-1Î±, and thus could impact on HIF-regulated genes as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Thus our transcriptomic analysis of hypoxic cells indicates that REST might play a key role in the regulation of proliferation and metabolic processes in hypoxia.</p>
      <p>Some of the REST functions may be maladaptive in cancer. For example, REST-Dependent repression of cell adhesion genes in hypoxia (<italic>ICAM5, ITGA8, SORBS1, LAMA4, LAMC1, LAMB1, COL14A1</italic> and <italic>COL4A5</italic>) might be of importance for metastasis as hypoxic suppression of adhesion molecules in cancer cells has been proposed as a mechanism to allow hypoxic cancer cells to escape their stressed environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Some of the previously described genes are part of cancer pathways (<italic>RB1, MET, MYCBP, WNT5A, HDAC1, PRKCB, LAM4A, LAMC1 and LAMB1</italic>). The significance of the hypoxic repression of these genes by REST will be context- and cell-specific as REST may play both tumour suppressor and oncogenic roles, a feature it shares with NOTCH signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, E-cadherin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and MYC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Indeed, a recent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> showed that knockdown of REST in normoxic prostate cancer cells can induce HIF signalling pathway, itself also implicated in cancer. In neuronal cancer, REST expression is high and has oncogenic properties by being anti-apoptotic and pro-tumorigenic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. We speculate that the hypoxic microenvironment present in these tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> could be a potential mechanism explaining REST over-expression. This is further supported by the observation that hypoxic neuroblastoma tumours and cells exposed to hypoxia (1% oxygen) down-regulate neuronal markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. REST is also implicated in stem cell renewal, and has been recently reported to accumulate in the nucleus of Marrow-isolated multilineage inducible (MIAMI) cells exposed to 3% oxygen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite being widely regarded as an activator of gene expression in hypoxia, there are a few genes reported to be directly repressed by HIF-1Î± in hypoxia (e.g. <italic>CFTR</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, <italic>ADK</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and <italic>APC</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Other examples of hypoxia-induced transcriptional repressors include DEC1 (differentially expressed in chondrocytes protein 1) which represses MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> and Bach1 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 1) which represses HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. However, none of these appear to regulate as broad a range of genes in hypoxia as REST. Indeed, our data indicates that REST regulates 20% of genes repressed in hypoxia, which may be a key and previously unappreciated feature of the hypoxic response. REST-repressed genes regulate biosynthetic metabolism, cell cycle and proliferation indicating a major role in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia. The whole set of 201âgenes repressed in hypoxia holds exciting possibilities regarding the discovery of novel mechanisms in the hypoxic response mediated by transcriptional repression. In summary, our findings have identified REST as a key regulator underlying gene repression and cellular adaptation in hypoxia.</p>

        <p>HEK293 (100 thousand cells) were seeded on 6 well plates, transfected the next day with REST-RNAi or Ctrl-RNAi in 1âÎ¼L of Lipofectamine 2000. In the day after transfection cells were exposed to 1% oxygen using pre-conditioned media for 24âhours. RNA was isolated using QIAgen RNeasy columns as per supplier instructions. Total RNA electropherograms were used to evaluate RNA integrity, with integrity number for all samples being of the highest quality, RINâ=â10, before being sent to the sequencing facility. Library construction began with 1âÎ¼g of total RNA. Since the protocol utilized was based on polyA capture, RNA was visualized on a BioRad Experion to insure RNA Quality Index values were greater than 8. For library construction the Illumina TruSeq v2 mRNA kit was utilized. This included also the poly(A)+ RNA isolation and DNase treatment. The protocol was followed according to manufacturerâs instructions except the final number of PCR cycles was 12 and not 15. Fifty base pare single end reads were prepared. Following construction, libraries were visualized by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the High Sensitivity Chip and quantified for pooling and sequencing using Kapa Biosystems qPCR quantitation kit according to manufacturerâs instructions. For sequencing libraries were diluted to 16âpM then applied to a V3 flowcell using the Illumina cBot according to manufacturerâs instructions. Sequencing was carried out on the Hi-Seq 2000 using HSCS v 1.5.15.1. Image analysis and base calling were carried out using RTA 1.13.48.0, and deconvolution and fastq file production were performed with CASAVA 1.8.2.

        <title>Analysis of the promoter of REST-Dependent hypoxia repressed genes</title>
        <p>Genomic sequences of genes identified as differentially regulated (âREST-Dependent genes repressed in hypoxiaâ) were extracted from the USCS Genome Browser database, selecting 2000 bases upstream (5â²) of the transcriptional start site (TSS) and 1000 bases 3â² of the TSS. When multiple TSS sites were annotated for a single gene, the 3âKb region was selected for all of them. The motif for the RE1 site from the JASPAR database (MA0138.2) was used as a frequency matrix and compared to the 3âKb sequences by the pssm.search method using the Biopython Bio.motifs module, with a pseudocount of 0.5 and Normal background (equal frequency of G:A:T:C bases). The log odds threshold was set to 15, which would yield an expected false positive rate of approximately 0.05 against random background sequences. The sensitivity of this method was calibrated against equal sized sets of 3âKb random sequences (using RSA-Tools) and against the target sequences with the RE1 motif bases shuffled (using EMBOSS).</p>
        <p>We found 12 high stringency RE1 motifs (log odds score of 15) in the promoter region (â2âKb/+1âKb) of REST-dependent genes repressed in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This number of hits is much higher than what could be found in control experiments, when the RE1 motif was searched against an equal sized set of random sequences (2.0034âÂ±â0.54âgene hits, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>) or randomly shuffling the promoter sequences from the REST genes (0.4âÂ±â0.54âgene hits, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This analysis strengthen the point that the REST-dependent genes repressed in hypoxia have consensus RE1 motifs in the â2âKb/+1âKb region of their promoter in a greater frequency than one would expect by chance.</p>

        <p>Our analysis showed that REST repressed 20% of the hypoxia-repressed genes, and only 0.7% of all genes repressed in normoxia. Furthermore there is only a limited overlap between the 2 transcriptional networks (5âgenes), and most of the genes repressed by REST in normoxia are still repressed by REST under hypoxia. Thus, rather than a shift on the transcriptional repertoire of REST target genes from normoxia to hypoxia, we show that there is a recruitment to new target genes in hypoxia.</p>
