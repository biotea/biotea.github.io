      <abstract>
        <p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and members of the proinflammatory interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) family are dependent on the presence of MyD88 for efficient signal transduction. The bipartite nature of MyD88 (<italic>N</italic>-terminal death domain [DD] and COOH-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor [TIR] domain) allows it to link the TIR domain of IL-1R/TLR with the DD of the Ser/Thr kinase termed IL-1Râassociated kinase (IRAK)-1. This triggers IRAK-1 phosphorylation and in turn the activation of multiple signaling cascades such as activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB. In contrast, expression of MyD88 short (MyD88s), an alternatively spliced form of MyD88 that lacks only the short intermediate domain separating the DD and TIR domains, leads to a shutdown of IL-1/lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Here, we provide the molecular explanation for this difference. MyD88 but not MyD88s strongly interacts with IRAK-4, a newly identified kinase essential for IL-1R/TLR signaling. In the presence of MyD88s, IRAK-1 is not phosphorylated and neither activates NF-ÎºB nor is ubiquitinated. Thus, MyD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL-1R/TLR/MyD88-triggered signals, leading to a transcriptionally controlled negative regulation of innate immune responses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>IL-1Râassociated kinase (IRAK)-1 was originally identified as a protein kinase that associates with the IL-1Rs (a heterocomplex composed of the IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP) after IL-1 stimulation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is now known to play an important role in the activation of NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades initiated by IL-1Î² and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Stimulation triggers the rapid recruitment of IRAK-1 to an activated receptor resulting in IRAK-1 hyperphosphorylation. Phosphorylation of IRAK-1 appears necessary for signal transduction. It is required for binding to TNFR-associated factor 6 and for the formation of a multiprotein signalosome that is crucial for driving the activation of the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1) and nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Phosphorylation of IRAK-1 also leads to its proteasome-mediated degradation, the function of which is unclear but might be a means of switching off or terminating the signal (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>The MyD88 short (MyD88s) protein (MyD88 without the intermediary domain (ID), amino acids 110â157) can be detected only after continuous stimulation with bacterial products (i.e., LPS) or proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNFÎ±; reference <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This inducible expression hints to its role as a negative regulator of Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) signaling that we previously proposed based on its ability to block IL-1/LPS-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Like MyD88, MyD88s binds both the IL-1R and IRAK-1, but in contrast to MyD88, ectopic expression of MyD88s does not induce IRAK-1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This suggested a potential mechanism for the inhibitory effect of MyD88s and that MyD88 via its ID might activate and/or bind a kinase required for IRAK-1 phosphorylation.</p>

IRAK-4 was PCR amplified from an expressed sequence tag (EST) clone and inserted into pCRIII containing an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Flag or a VSV tag, or inserted into pGAD10. Kinase-dead mutants of IRAK-4 (IRAK-4KK213AA or IRAK-4D311N) were generated by double PCR and inserted into a pCRIII vector with an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal tag. pGBT9 MyD88, pGBT9 MyD88-N (amino acids 1â172), and pGBT9 MyD88-TIR (amino acids 161â296) expressing pGALDB (the GAL4 DNA-binding domain) fused to full-length MyD88 or the indicated deletion mutants have been described previously (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). pGBT9 MyD88-ID (amino acids 110â157) and pGBT9 MyD88-death domain (DD; amino acids 1â110) were prepared by inserting PCR-generated fragments into pGBT9. The sequence of all PCR-generated cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGAD10 IRAK-4âexpressing Gal4AD-IRAK4 (a fusion protein of GAL4 transcription activation with full-length IRAK-4) was made by inserting IRAK-4 cDNA as an EcoRI fragment into pGAD10.</p>

Transformation efficiency was verified by growth on appropriate synthetic media using Trp and Leu selection markers. Protein interaction was revealed by His auxotrophy and assessed by Î² galactosidase expression filter assays. ++ indicates strong color development within 60 min of the assay and â indicates no development of color within 24 h.

        <p>For the kinase assays, transiently transfected HEK 293T cells were lysed in 500 Î¼l of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. IRAK-1KD was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4Â°C with an antiâIRAK-1 antibody (Qbiogene), followed by the addition of protein A trisacryl (Pierce Chemical Co.). Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. After the last wash, immune complexes were resuspended in 40 Î¼l kinase buffer. For each kinase reaction 10 Î¼l of the respective immune complexes were mixed with 5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 25 Î¼l. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30Â°C and then directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

        <title>The ID of MyD88 Is Critical for IRAK-1 Phosphorylation.</title>
        <p>Initially, to prove that MyD88's ID is indeed crucial for IRAK-1 phosphorylation, a MyD88<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cell line was generated and stably reconstituted with MyD88- or MyD88s-expressing vectors, referred to here as MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88 or MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s. The cells were stimulated with IL-1Î² and IRAK-1 levels were monitored (as a readout for phosphorylation-induced degradation) in total cell extracts by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). As previously reported, IRAK-1 was not activated in MyD88<sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, activation of IRAK-1 was restored in the MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88 cells as evidenced by the disappearance of IRAK-1 in an IL-1Î²âdependent manner. Even in the unstimulated MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88 cells, very little IRAK-1 was detected demonstrating the effect that MyD88 overexpression alone has on IRAK-1 stability. In contrast, IRAK-1 levels in MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s cells were comparable to those in control cells, confirming that expression of MyD88s does not trigger IRAK-1 phosphorylation and that the ID is essential for IRAK-1 phosphorylation. The ID of MyD88 is also essential for IL-1Î²âinduced NF-ÎºB activation, based on the absence of IÎºB degradation in MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s cells stimulated with IL-1Î² (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B).</p>

Reconstituted populations of cells are referred to as MEF<sup>+</sup> vector, MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88, and MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s and were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1Î² for 0.5 or 16 h. Total cell lysates were prepared and IRAK-1 levels were monitored by Western blotting with antiâIRAK-1 antibodies. The levels of MyD88 or MyD88s in MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88 and MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s cells were confirmed by Western analysis with anti-MyD88 antibodies (middle).

(B) MEF<sup>+</sup> vector, MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88, and MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s cells were stimulated with IL-1Î² or TNFÎ± for the indicated times.

In both MEF<sup>+</sup> vector and MEF<sup>+</sup> MyD88s cells the IÎºB degradation machinery is intact as evidenced by treatment with TNFÎ±.</p>

        <title>MyD88 Is Required for IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1 Phosphorylation.</title>
        <p>For sometime it was speculated that IRAK-1 was phosphorylated via its own kinase activity. However, this idea was challenged by the discovery that a kinase-dead mutant of IRAK-1 (subsequently referred to as IRAK-1KD) was phosphorylated in an IRAK-1âdeficient cell line (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A second kinase was postulated to phosphorylate IRAK-1 and perhaps to activate IRAK-1's own kinase activity. Recently, IRAK-4, so called for its homology to other members of the IRAK-1 family (other members include the kinase-inactive IRAK-2 and IRAK-M/3), was identified as a candidate for the IRAK-1 kinase (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This was based on in vitro kinase assays and the observation that IL-1âinduced degradation of IRAK-1 was partially blocked by overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of IRAK-4 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). IRAK-4âdeficient mice confirm that IRAK-4 is critical for signaling of IL-1 and TLR ligands (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and in contrast to other IRAKs, IRAK-4 appears to require its kinase activity for signal transmission (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
        <p>To obtain additional evidence that IRAK-4 is a kinase for IRAK-1, we developed a simple coexpression assay in HEK 293T cells. IRAK-4 was cotransfected with IRAK-1KD (IRAK-1D340N; used because it cannot self-phosphorylate like overexpressed wild-type IRAK-1) and phosphorylation monitored by the appearance of a slower migrating species in SDS-PAGE. As predicted, IRAK-4 induced phosphorylation of IRAK-1KD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). That phosphorylation was specifically induced by IRAK-4 was confirmed by the observation that coexpression of IRAK-1KD with two different IRAK-4 kinase-dead mutants, IRAK-4KD (IRAK-4KK213AA or IRAK-4D311N), did not similarly induce IRAK-1KD phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A and unpublished data). Although coexpression of IRAK-4 clearly induced IRAK-1 phosphorylation, only a partial conversion to the phosphorylated species was observed. The addition of MyD88, however, significantly enhanced IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1KD phosphorylation, suggesting that MyD88 stimulates IRAK-4's activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). This was confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B) performed on immunoprecipitated IRAK-1KD showing significant phosphorylation of IRAK-1KD when immunoprecipitated from cell extracts coexpressing MyD88 and IRAK-4, but not IRAK-4KD (compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 5).</p>

Total cell lysates were prepared, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with antiâIRAK-1 antibodies.

        <p>As MyD88 binds to IRAK-1KD (MyD88 does not bind the hyperphosphorylated form of IRAK-1 induced by its overexpression; references <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and was recently reported to bind IRAK-4 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the simplest explanation for the observed finding was that MyD88 modulates contact of IRAK-1 and IRAKâ4. To test this, IRAK-1KD and IRAK-4 interactions were analyzed in the presence or absence of MyD88 and/or MyD88s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). As previously reported, IRAK-4 and IRAK-1KD do not directly associate (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, the addition of MyD88 but not MyD88s (discussed below) permitted assembly of a complex containing both IRAKs. MyD88 thereby appears to act like a hinge inducing the proximity of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4. Interestingly, phosphorylated IRAK-1 is stably detected together with MyD88, IRAK-1, and IRAK-4, suggesting that MyD88âIRAK-1 interactions are destabilized only after multiple sites are phosphorylated on IRAK-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C).</p>

        <title>MyD88s Blocks IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1 Phosphorylation.</title>
        <p>Unlike MyD88, MyD88s does not stimulate IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1KD phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In fact, in vitro phosphorylation of IRAK-1KD induced by IRAK-4 coexpression was completely inhibited when MyD88s was coexpressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B, compare lanes 2 and 4). In addition, MyD88s inhibited MyD88's stimulatory effect on IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1KD phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A).</p>

        <title>MyD88s Does not Bind to IRAK-4 and Blocks Recruitment of IRAK-4 to the IL-1Rs.</title>
        <p>To characterize the underlying mechanism by which MyD88s blocks IRAK-1 phosphorylation, we initially analyzed if MyD88 and IRAK-4 associate. We did not expect the contrary, considering that MyD88 binds IRAK-1 primarily through DDâDD interactions (19, 22, and unpublished data). Surprisingly, MyD88sâIRAK-4 complexes were not detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, left), despite the strong association of MyD88s and IRAK-1KD under similar conditions of coimmunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, right). Therefore, this suggested that the ID of MyD88 is required for this association with IRAK-4. To confirm this, the precise region of MyD88 mediating its interaction with IRAK-4 was mapped by yeast 2 hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation binding assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B and unpublished data). These assays confirm that MyD88 does, and MyD88s does not, interact with IRAK4. However, the ID in itself is insufficient, suggesting that MyD88 interacts with IRAK-4 via a peptide spanning both the ID and adjacent amino acids in the DD (we cannot exclude that the first 17 amino acids of the TIR are important for binding) or that the ID induces a conformation of MyD88, exposing residues in the DD that are critical for interactions between the two proteins.</p>

Interaction of the proteins was assessed by Î² galactosidase expression filter assays. ++ indicates strong color development within 60 min of the assay and â indicates no development of color within 24 h. All pGBT9 fusion proteins were checked for autoactivation and found to be negative. (C) Flag-tagged IL-1Rs were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies from lysates of 293T cells cotransfected with the indicated expression plasmids and immunoblotted with an anti-Xpress antibody to detect IRAK-4KD association. The same blot was reprobed with anti-Flag, anti-E, and antiâIRAK-1 antibodies to monitor IL-1Rs, MyD88, and IRAK-1KD levels, respectively.

        <p>Taken together, the results described above suggested that MyD88s acts as a negative regulator by its incapacity to bind to IRAK-4 and thus prevents IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1 phosphorylation. IRAK-4 is presumably recruited to the activated IL-1R complex raising the question of whether MyD88s also blocks IRAK-4 recruitment to the activated receptors. To address this question, coimmunoprecipitation of the IL-1Rs with associating proteins (MyD88, IRAK-1KD, and IRAK-4-KD) was performed in the presence or absence of MyD88s and/or Tollip, which we have previously shown to be important for IRAK-1 recruitment to the IL-1Rs (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). More IRAK-4 was found to associate with the IL-1Rs in the presence of Tollip, suggesting that Tollip may also be involved in IRAK-4 recruitment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). However, despite Tollip, the presence of MyD88s dramatically inhibited IRAK-4 but not IRAK-1 association with the IL-1Rs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C).</p>
        <p>In summary, we have demonstrated why the ID of MyD88 is critical for the activation of NF-ÎºB. Via this domain, MyD88 plays an active role in the phosphorylation and activation of IRAK-1. Our results are compatible with the following sequence of events (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) . After their recruitment to the IL-1RâTLR complexes, MyD88, most probably as a dimer (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), binds IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, inducing the close proximity of the IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 kinase domains. This in turn allows IRAK-4 to phosphorylate critical residue(s) in the kinase activation loop of IRAK-1, triggering IRAK-1's own kinase activity. Threonine-387 and Serine-376 are potential phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of IRAK-1 based on the reduced ability of IRAK-4 to phosphorylate short peptides with mutations at these residues (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Once activated, IRAK-1 likely autophosphorylates residues in its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus resulting in the hyperphosphorylated form detected after stimulation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is this multiphosphorylated form of IRAK-1 that is likely targeted for degradation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Under chronic conditions of inflammation or after prolonged exposure to LPS MyD88s is expressed (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As a result, the above sequence of events is halted. IRAK-4 is not recruited to the IL-1Rs/TLRs and therefore IRAK-1 is not phosphorylated/activated and as a consequence signal transmission is interrupted. In conclusion, MyD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL-1Î²/LPS-induced NF-ÎºB activation by preventing IRAK-4's access to its substrate.</p>

            <p>Model for MyD88/MyD88s regulation of IRAK-4âinduced IRAK-1 phosphorylation. On the left, MyD88 links IRAK-1 with IRAK-4âactivating NF-ÎºB. IL-1 stimulation of the IL-1Rs induces assembly of a signaling complex containing MyD88 and IRAK-1 and IRAK-4. Dimers of MyD88 bind IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 bringing the respective kinase domains in close association (step 1). This results in the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 by IRAK-4, which in turn likely induces the kinase activity of IRAK-1 leading to its autophosphorylation (step 2). IRAK-4 is depicted activated at the IL-1Rs but this has not been formally demonstrated. Phosphorylated IRAK-1 first binds TNFR-associated factor 6 (not depicted) activating NF-ÎºB and then is ubiquitinated (multiple arrows attached to IRAK-1) and degraded. For simplicity, other adaptor molecules such as Tollip have been omitted (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). On the right, inhibition of IL-1 signaling by MyD88s is shown. MyD88s (depicted as a shorter molecule missing the ID) does not interact with IRAK-4. IRAK-4 is not recruited to the IL-1Rs, thereby preventing the association of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 and thus the phosphorylation of IRAK-1. As a result, there is no NF-ÎºB activation.</p>

        <p>Septic shock is characterized by tissue and organ damage resulting from hyperproduction of cytokines. Septic shock survivors have an increased incidence of bacterial infections and suppressed monocyte responses to LPS. This âendotoxin toleranceâ is a transient state of LPS refractoriness after the initial, nonlethal exposure to LPS. An understanding of the mechanisms that elicit endotoxin tolerance is critical for unraveling the molecular basis of the septic shock syndrome, yet despite numerous studies these mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that IRAK-3 (IRAK-M) is a key component of this important control system (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). IRAK-3 lacks kinase activity, is only expressed upon prior endotoxin treatment, and blocks TLR-induced signaling. IRAK-3âdeficient cells, however, still retain some capacity to develop LPS tolerance, indicating the presence of additional control mechanisms. Aside from the proposed down-regulation of TLR4 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), MyD88s also appears to be a likely candidate for tolerance induction as the expression of MyD88s is inducible by LPS and TNF (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, MyD88s and IRAK-3 might both contribute to endotoxin tolerance.</p>
