      <abstract>
        <p>Akt/protein kinase B is a pivotal component downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, whose activity regulates the balance between cell survival and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Akt occurs at two key sites either at Thr308 site in the activation loop or at Ser473 site in the hydrophobic motif. The phosphorylated form of Akt (pAkt) is activated to promote cell survival. The mechanisms of pAkt dephosphorylation and how the signal transduction of Akt pathway is terminated are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel protein phosphatase CSTP1(complete s transactivated protein 1), which interacts and dephosphorylates Akt specifically at Ser473 site <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, blocks cell cycle progression and promotes cell apoptosis. The effects of CSTP1 on cell survival and cell cycle were abrogated by depletion of phosphatase domain of CSTP1 or by expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (S473D), suggesting Ser473 site of Akt as a primary cellular target of CSTP1. Expression profile analysis showed that CSTP1 expression is selectively down-regulated in non-invasive bladder cancer tissues and over-expression of CSTP1 suppressed the size of tumors in nude mice. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that decreased expression of CSTP1 implicated significantly reduced recurrence-free survival in patients suffered from non-invasive bladder cancers.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bladder cancer is the second most common malignancy in the genitourinary tract, with 350,000 newly diagnosed cases and over 145,000 deaths each year worldwide <xref rid="pone.0065679-Ploeg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Because long-term surveillances of the patients are necessary, together with possible tumor recurrences and other complications, treatments of bladder cancers usually cost a lot of money. According to the differences in clinical developments, pathology and molecular alteration profiles, bladder cancers are classified into two types of carcinomas: the non-muscle invasive superficial, papillary carcinomas and the muscle invasive carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0065679-Margaret1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The non-muscle invasive superficial, papillary carcinomas are usually low life-threatening, but with high incidences and high recurrences, while the muscle invasive carcinomas often cause distant metastasis and quick deaths <xref rid="pone.0065679-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Multiple signaling pathways are implicated in initiation and progression of bladder cancers, including mutations in PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK oncogenic path way components and alterations in the tumor suppressors, such as p53 and Rb. There is increasing evidence indicating that alterations in these pathway components are not only associated with initiation of bladder cancers, but also strongly correlated with disease recurrence, progression and survival. For example, gain of function mutations of Ras, FGFR3, PIK3CA are frequently implicated in the non-muscle invasive superficial, papillary carcinomas, whereas loss of function alterations of p53 and Rb genes are found more frequently in aggressive, muscle invasive carcinomas<xref rid="pone.0065679-Mitra1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0065679-Bakkar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) pathway regulates the balance between cell survival and apoptosis, and this balance is often disrupted in many types of human cancers, including the human urothelial bladder cancers <xref rid="pone.0065679-Margaret1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Akt is a pivotal downstream component of the PI3K pathway, which can be activated by sequential phosphorylation at two sites conserved in the AGC kinase family <xref rid="pone.0065679-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For example, an upstream kinase PDK-1 can phosphorylate the Thr308 site in the activation loop of Akt1 <xref rid="pone.0065679-Alessi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065679-Stephens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which triggers the autophosphorylation of Akt1 at its C-terminal Ser473 <xref rid="pone.0065679-Toker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and thus fully activates Akt1. Akt signaling can be terminated by two mechanisms: removal of the active lipid second messenger that is catalyzed by the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) <xref rid="pone.0065679-Maehama1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and dephosphorylation of the activated Akt. Akt can also be directly dephosphorylated by the PP2A-type phosphatases <xref rid="pone.0065679-Andjelkovic1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or other protein phosphatases such as PHLPP1(PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1) and PHLPP2 <xref rid="pone.0065679-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065679-Brognard1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we reported a novel protein phosphatase, termed the complete s transactivated protein 1(CSTP1) <xref rid="pone.0065679-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, whose expression was selectively reduced in non-muscle invasive bladder cancers. To make a further understand of the significance of CSTP1 in bladder carcinogenesis, in this study, we will go deep insight into i. the effects of CSTP1 on bladder cancer cell cycle, apoptosis and tumor formation in vivo and the underlined molecular mechanisms; ii. the molecular mechanisms through which CSTP1 exerts its biological function; iii. the significance of decreased expression of CSTP1 on the recurrence and prognosis of non-invasive bladder cancers.</p>

(D) Western blot analysis of CSTP1 expression in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1 Myc/His C-CSTP1 plasmid, 48 h later, the level of CSTP1-Myc fusion protein was tested by anti-Myc antibody. Actin was used as internal control. (E) CSTP1 displayed a PP2B-like protein phosphatase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1Myc/His C-CSTP1, 48 h later, the CSTP1-His fusion protein was purified for phosphatase assay. The release of Pi was determined in the presence of 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> and 250 Âµg/ml calmodulin. 200 nM trifluoroperazine or 0.5 Âµmol of Okadaic Acid was also added to abrogate the phosphatase activity of PP2B or PP2A.</p>

        <p>Finally, we determined if CSTP1 protein displayed a Serine/Threonine phosphatase activity in vitro. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1myc/his C-CSTP1 plasmids and the CSTP1-His fusion protein were purified for phosphatase assay. The enzymatic activity was determined by measuring the release of Pi from the commercial synthetic peptide substrate containing a phosphothreonine residue [RRA(pT)VA]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, CSTP1 protein catalyzed Pi released from RRA(pT)VA peptides, furthermore, PP2B specific inhibitor, trifluoroperazine almost abrogated its phosphatase activity, while PP2A specific inhibitor Okadaic Acid did not affect CSTP1 activity.</p>

        <title>CSTP1 Over-expression Suppresses Bladder Cancer Cell Proliferation and Colony Formation, but not Invasion</title>
        <p>Given the observation that CSTP1 mRNA was decreased in bladder cancer tissues, we presumed that CSTP1 may function as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancers. To investigate the role of CSTP1 in cell function, we first analyzed the effect of CSTP1 overexpression on cell proliferation. CSTP1 was stably overexpressed in EJ bladder cancer cells via lentiviral infection and cell proliferation was assessed by MTT method. Overexpression of CSTP1 inhibited the proliferation of EJ cells by 50% after a 5-daysâ culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) , while, depletion of PP2Ac domain impaired the growth-inhibition ability of CSTP1 on EJ Cells by 80%( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistent with the results of MTT assay, overexpression of CSTP1 decreased the colony formation capacity of EJ cells, and depletion of PP2Ac domain rescued the colony formation ability of EJ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

        <p>To explore the effect of CSTP1 on cell cycle, lentivirus transduced EJ cells were synchronized at G0/G1 phase by two rounds of thymidine treatment and cell cycle were analyzed by FACS at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h after releasing from G0/G1 phase by the addition of complete medium.

Furthermore, a lower percentage of G2/M phase cells at 8 h after released from cell cycle blocking were also observed in CSTP1-overexpressing cells, while cells overexpressing CSTP1 ÎPP2Ac did not show delayed cell cycle progression.

        <title>CSTP1 Interacts with and Dephosphorylates pAkt at Ser473 Site</title>
        <p>To explore the underlined mechanisms responsible for the elevated apoptosis and retarded cell cycle of bladder cancer cells mediated by CSTP1, we seek to find signaling pathways downstream of CSTP1 overexpression. Signaling pathways that usually involved in cancer biology, cell cycle control or cell proliferation were examined in CSTP1-overexpressing EJ cells by analysis of luciferase activity using Cignal Reporter Assay Kit. Results shown that FOXO factor had a more robust transcriptional activity in CSTP1-overexpressing cells(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). The increase of FOXO activity was further demonstrated by reduction in the phosphorylation state of FOXO3A at Thr32 site after CSTP1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Since Akt kinase is the primary negative regulator upstream of FOXO factor, we supposed that Akt kinase activity could decreased in CSTP1-overexpressing cells. To confirm this hypothesis, the phosphorylated Akt at Thr308 or Ser473 site, which represents the activation state of Akt, were detected. Western blot results shown that overexpression of CSTP1 decreased the level of phosphorylated Akt at Ser473 site, but the level of phosphorylated Akt at Thr308 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Since CSTP1 is downregulated in bladder cancer tissues, so we asked whether loss of CSTP1 expression in urothelial cells could result in the activation of Akt kinase and inactivation of FOXO factor. Consistent with the CSTP1 overexpression assay, knockdown of CSTP1 in SV-HUC1 increased the phosphorylation level of Akt at Ser473 site and FOXO3A at Thr32 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). To further investigate the effect of CSTP1 overexpression on the activity of Akt, we also examined other four well-known proteins that dependent on Akt for phosphorylation, GSK3Î±, GSK3Î², p70S6K, and TSC2. To our surprise, CSTP1 overexpression did not affect the phosphorylation status of GSK3Î±, GSK3Î², p70S6K, and TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Next, we tested if CSTP1 could directly bind to and dephosphorylate phosphorylated Akt at Ser473. CSTP1 and Akt expression plasmids, harboring Myc and Flag tag respectively, were cotransfected into 293T cells. Total protein was extracted and immunoprecipitated with antibody against Flag tag, and western blots were performed using anti-CSTP1 antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>, CSTP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Flag-tagged Akt(up panel), the same result was obtained when the whole protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-CSTP1 antibodies and immunobloted with anti-Flag antibodies(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065679-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>, low panel). These results indicated that Akt interacts with CSTP1 in intact cells. To further explore whether purified CSTP1 can dephosphorylate Akt in vitro, full-length CSTP1 was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, and Akt dephosphorylation assay was performed as described by Tianyan Gao <xref rid="pone.0065679-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Just as in many other types of cancers, Akt kinase is often aberrantly activated in bladder cancers <xref rid="pone.0065679-Margaret1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Activated Akt kinase plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth, proliferation and survival <xref rid="pone.0065679-Cantley1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Several molecular mechanisms have been identified to aberrantly activate the Akt kinase signaling pathway in bladder cancers, including: (1) mutations of upstream activators, such as p110Î± (PIK3CA), FGFR3 and Ras<xref rid="pone.0065679-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0065679-Billerey1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>; (2) activating mutations of the Akt kinase <xref rid="pone.0065679-Askham1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and (3) loss of heterozygosity (LOH), homozygous deletion and inactivating mutations of the negative regulator PTEN<xref rid="pone.0065679-Cappellen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0065679-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although great progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms leading to Akt phosphorylation and activation, little is known about the mechanisms terminating Akt signaling. In 2005, a model was proposed by Tianyan Gao <xref rid="pone.0065679-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> that the termination of Akt signaling was controlled by two key proteins, PTEN and PHLPP. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that prevents activation by removing the second messenger that activates Akt. PHLPP is a protein phosphatase that inactivates Akt by direct dephosphorylation of Ser473 site in the hydrophobic motif. In this study, we identified a novel protein phosphatase, CSTP1, which catalyzed dephosphorylation of phosphothreonine residue [RRA(pT)VA] in vitro, and PP2B specific inhibitor can abrogated its phosphatase activity, suggested that CSTP1 protein displayed a PP2B-like phosphatase activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that CSTP1 can interact and selectively dephosphorylate Akt at S473 site, suggesting a possibility that each phosphorylation sites on Akt can be targeted by more than one phosphatase.</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that many oncogenes and proto-oncogenes are phosphorylated protein kinases <xref rid="pone.0065679-Hanahan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065679-Broach1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In most cases, their activation contributes to tumorigenesis, therefore, protein phosphatases which exhibite the opposite activity of kinases may serve as tumor suppressors, with the PP2A protein phosphatase as an example <xref rid="pone.0065679-Janssens1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Consistent with this knowledge, our study showed that the expression of CSTP1 mRNA dramatically decreased in 80% of bladder cancer tissues. Overexpression of CSTP1 inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation, colony formation in vitro and bladder xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. This suggests that protein phosphatase CSTP1 could function as a tumor suppressor, at least, in human bladder cancers. Blocking cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis are two important mechanisms for anti-proliferative gene to suppress cancer cells growth. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis revealed that CSTP1 overexpression inhibited cancer cells to go through the cell cycle and sensitized bladder cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs, and depletion of PP2Ac domain abrogated the growth-inhibition and death-promotion ability of CSTP1, suggesting that CSTP1 exerted its tumor suppression function through inhibiting cell cycle progression and promoting cell apoptosis., and that protein phosphatase activity of CSTP1 plays a crucial role in its tumor suppression activity. Expression profile analysis revealed that CSTP1 mRNA was selectively decreased in non-invasive bladder cancer tissues, suggesting that CSTP1 plays an important role mainly in bladder carcinogenesis, and it may be used as a potential target for bladder cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>Since complete activation of Akt requires the phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 <xref rid="pone.0065679-Alessi2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> site, and phosphorylation at Ser473 appears to be critical for the regulation of Akt activity because selective dephosphorylation of Thr308 does not significantly affect the activity of Akt <xref rid="pone.0065679-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, our results showed that Ser473 dephosphorylation of Akt by CSTP1 did not affect the phosphorylation levels of Akt targets GSK3, p70S6K and TSC2, although the phosphorylation level of FOXO3A could be regulated. This was in accordance with published data reported by Jacinto <xref rid="pone.0065679-Jacinto1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> that defective Ser473 phosphorylation affected only a subset of Akt targets in vivo, including FOXO1/3A, while other Akt targets, TSC2 and GSK3, and the TORC1 effectors, S6K and 4E-BP1, were unaffected. Therefore, dephosphorylation at S473 determines the specificity of Aktâs function rather than its absolute activity.</p>
      <p>Bladder cancers can be divided into two major groups: non-invasive papillary tumors and muscle-invasive tumors. In the majority of cases, these two groups of carcinomas do not represent a developmental continuum <xref rid="pone.0065679-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065679-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> , and are thought to arise from at least 2 separate mechanisms. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2âT4) is thought to develop via flat dysplasia and carcinoma in situ(CIS) and these tumours are usually of non-papillary architecture. Non-invasive(Ta) tumours are believed to arise via flat urothelial hyperplasia followed by development of an exophytic papillary architecture <xref rid="pone.0065679-Margaret1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A more prevalent decrease of CSTP1 expression was found in non-invasive bladder cancer tissues than that in the muscle-invasive tissues, provides a new strong evidence to this point of view. The major problem in the clinical treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder is the frequent recurrence. Much research has focused on the identification of the molecular or epigenetic markers to precisely predict the clinical outcome of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, but little progress has been made. In our study, expression levels of CSTP1 are positively correlated to the recurrence-free survival of patients with Ta and T1 bladder cancers, indicate it may be a useful marker for prognostic prediction of non-muscle invasive bladder cancers.</p>
      <p>Taken together, we have identified a novel protein phosphatase targeting Akt protein kinase, CSTP1, which dephosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt specifically at the Ser473 site, blocks cell cycle progression, promotes cell apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth in nude mice. CSTP1 expression was selectively reduced in bladder cancer tissues and its expression level is positively correlated to the recurrence-free survival of patients with Ta and T1(non-invasive) bladder cancers, and may serve as a prognostic marker for non-muscle invasive bladder cancers.</p>
