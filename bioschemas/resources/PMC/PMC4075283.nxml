      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that functions in sensory and signaling pathways. Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic syndromes known as ciliopathies<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary ciliogenesis in normal and cancer cells are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a ciliopathy protein OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1) at centriolar satellites promotes primary cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged organelles, and protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy upon serum starvation. In autophagy-deficient <italic>Atg5</italic> or <italic>Atg3</italic> null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Ofd1 accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia and a defective recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These defects are fully rescued by Ofd1 partial knockdown that reduces the population of Ofd1 at the centriolar satellites. More strikingly, OFD1 depletion at centriolar satellite promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and transformed breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that removal of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to promote ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized role of autophagy in organelle biogenesis.</p>

    <p id="P2">During autophagy, the membrane anchored LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) interacts with cargo and cargo-adaptor proteins, recruiting cargoes to the autophagosome for subsequent degradation upon fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. We carried out a tandem-affinity purification using tagged LC3 as bait to search for its interacting proteins (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition to known LC3-interacting proteins (MAP1B, FYCO1, p62, and Keap1<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>), we identified a set of centriolar satellite proteins, including PCM1, OFD1 and CEP131, that had not previously been shown to associate with LC3. PCM1 was also pulled down by LC3 orthologs, GATE16 and GABARAP (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). PCM1, OFD1 and LC3 co-immunoprecipitated with each other, suggesting that they are in the same complex (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1bâ1d</xref>). PCM1 likely enhances the interaction between LC3 and OFD1, as the OFD1-LC3 interaction is compromised in PCM1-depleted cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e, f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">Depletion of PCM1 by RNA interference had no significant effect on autophagy activity as determined by LC3 lipidation and p62 degradation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). We then examined if any of these centriolar satellite proteins is an autophagy substrate. Ofd1 protein levels were reduced by serum starvation and this reduction was compromised in autophagy-deficient <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs, whereas PCM1, IFT88 and BBS4 protein levels were not altered by serum starvation or in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). The messenger RNA levels of Ofd1 were not significantly changed upon serum starvation in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that Ofd1 protein level reduction upon serum starvation is through protein degradation rather than transcriptional downregulation. Blocking autophagic flux by lysosomal inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (Baf) or chloroquine (CQ) resulted in increased Ofd1 accumulation upon serum starvation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Ofd1 is degraded via the autophagy-lysosome pathway upon serum starvation.</p>
    <p id="P4"><italic>OFD1</italic> is the gene underlying the human disease oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1), an X-linked ciliopathy characterized by morphological abnormalities and renal cysts, as well as Joubert syndrome and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. OFD1 localizes to the distal ends of centrioles and is necessary for distal appendage formation, IFT88 recruitment, and primary cilium formation<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. OFD1 also localizes to centriolar satellites, interacting with proteins associated with human ciliary disease, PCM1, Cep290, BBS4<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, the function of this OFD1 population remains unclear.</p>
    <p id="P5">The centriolar satellite localization of OFD1 is determined by PCM1, since OFD1 was lost from satellites when PCM1 was depleted (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). LC3 partially colocalized with PCM1 upon serum starvation in a majority of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, but rarely in unstressed cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d</xref>). LC3 also partially colocalized with endogenous OFD1 when lysosome activity is blocked by Baf or CQ treatment (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a, b</xref>). This colocalization was limited to the centriolar satellites, as LC3 did not colocalize with the centriole marker Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c, d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">OFD1 was present at both the centrioles and the centriolar satellites in untreated RPE cells. Remarkably, the centriolar satellite pool of OFD1 was dramatically reduced upon serum starvation, while the population of OFD1 at the centrioles remained unchanged (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). This serum starvation- induced OFD1 degradation from centriolar satellites was blocked in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs treated with the lysosome inhibitor CQ (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Notably, PCM1 protein levels are not controlled by autophagy and the centriolar satellite distribution of PCM1 is not altered upon serum starvation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4câe</xref>), suggesting that the autophagic degradation is specific to OFD1 at centriolar satellites rather than centriolar satellites as a whole. This notion is further supported by our observation that Ofd1 remained at centriolar satellites upon serum starvation in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs but was lost from centriolar satellites in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">The loss of Ofd1 from centriolar satellites was significantly faster than the loss of Ofd1 from centrioles, and the rate of loss of Ofd1 in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs was slower than that in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). The centriolar satellite pool of Ofd1 in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells was lost within six hours of serum starvation, whereas this pool of Ofd1 in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells remained stable even after twenty-four hours of serum starvation (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). These data confirm that Ofd1 at centriolar satellites has a faster turnover rate than Ofd1 at centrioles, and this serum starvation induced accelerated degradation is controlled by autophagy.</p>
    <p id="P8">We next sought to understand how OFD1 regulation might affect ciliogenesis. We observed that the percentage of <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells that form a primary cilium, as compared to <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells, was significantly reduced and the cilia that did form were shorter (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This difference was not due to cell cycle regulation (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Lysosome inhibition also compromised primary ciliogenesis in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6bâd</xref>). The defective ciliogenesis phenotypes were not limited to <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs, as similar phenotypes were also observed in MEFs lacking another essential autophagy gene, <italic>Atg3</italic> (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6eâg</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">We next investigated if the ciliary recruitment of BBS4, a critical event for ciliogenesis<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, is affected in autophagy-deficient cells. We observed that BBS4 accumulated at centriolar satellites in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs; more than 50% of cilia had detectable BBS4 in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs, whereas only about 10% of cilia were positive for BBS4 in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). These data indicate that BBS4 recruitment to cilia is also defective in autophagy deficient cells.</p>
    <p id="P10">If Ofd1 accumulation at centriolar satellites is responsible for the ciliary defects in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs, we would expect that depletion of Ofd1 by RNA interference might rescue these defects. In <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs stably expressing Ofd1 shRNA, with about 50% efficiency of overall depletion of Ofd1 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>), Ofd1 remained at centrioles but was lost from centriolar satellites (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8bâd</xref>). Primary cilium formation upon serum starvation was fully restored in these cells; nearly 70% of cells formed a cilium and the length of these cilia was comparable to those formed in <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Hence, the centriolar satellite pool of Ofd1 indeed plays a key role in suppressing primary ciliogenesis in <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs. Strikingly, with Ofd1 knockdown, nearly 35% of the <italic>Atg5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells formed cilia even without serum starvation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that Ofd1 degradation is likely required for serum starvation-induced primary ciliogenesis. This notion is supported by the observation that primary cilia formed efficiently even in the cycling <italic>Atg5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs depleted of Ofd1 without serum starvation (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). The presence of cilia in MEFs was further confirmed by the positive staining of the cilium marker Arl13b (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>), which specifically decorates the ciliary membrane<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P11">Primary cilia are formed in normal breast epithelial cells but not detected in breast cancer cell lines such as MCF7<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Restoration of primary cilia in human cancer cells might be beneficial to reduce malignancy, since cilia are required for proper functions of several signaling pathways (hedgehog etc.) that play crucial roles in many types of cancers<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We further tested if OFD1 reduction could restore primary ciliogenesis in MCF7 cells. We generated an OFD1 stable knockdown clone (C19) in MCF7 cells, which exhibited 44% ODF1 depletion efficiency (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Similar to OFD1 knockdown MEFs, the centriolar satellite population of OFD1 in C19 cells was dramatically reduced, while the centriole pool remained stable (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10aâc</xref>). Remarkably, primary cilia formed in about 20% C19 cells upon serum starvation, but were completely absent in parental MCF7 cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). The length of these cilia ranged from 2 Î¼m to 6 Î¼m (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). As expected for normal primary cilia, these cilia extended from basal bodies and were positive for Arl13b, acetylated-tubulin, and the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10dâf</xref>). Finally these cilia could be directly visualized under the scanning electron microscope (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, by manipulating the expression of one protein, OFD1, it is possible to reverse the cilia-defective phenotype of a transformed breast cancer cell line. Primary ciliogenesis remains inefficient in C19 cells, suggesting that addition factors are required to reach full capacity. Nevertheless, these data confirm that OFD1 at the centriolar satellite functions as a crucial suppressor of primary ciliogenesis in human cancer cells.</p>
    <p id="P12">We show here that autophagy is linked to primary ciliogenesis, by controlling the degradation of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. We propose that autophagy deficiency serves as a potential underlying mechanism of ciliopathies, and that autophagy modulation might provide a novel means of ciliopathy treatment. We demonstrate that OFD1 at centriolar satellites plays a crucial role in suppressing primary ciliogenesis, which is different from OFD1 at centrioles that has been shown to be essential for ciliogenesis. Removing OFD1 from centriolar satellites promotes ciliogenesis in autophagy-deficient cells, wild-type MEFs without serum starvation, and human breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally completely lack cilia, suggesting a general role of OFD1 in suppressing ciliogenesis. Primary ciliogenesis is defective in human breast and pancreatic cancer cells, but activated in the corresponding normal tissues/cells<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The contribution of primary cilium function to tumorigenesis is complex<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, however our results suggest that dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of OFD1 will provide insight into these functions and potentially offer new therapeutic tools for treatment of ciliopathies and cancers.</p>
