      <abstract>
        <p>The recently described junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) in man and mice are involved in homotypic and heterotypic intercellular interactions. Here, a third member of this family, human JAM-3, was identified and described as a novel counterreceptor on platelets for the leukocyte Î²2-integrin Mac-1 (Î±MÎ²2, CD11b/CD18). With the help of two monoclonal antibodies, Gi11 and Gi13, against a 43-kD surface glycoprotein on human platelets, a full-length cDNA encoding JAM-3 was identified. JAM-3 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing two Ig-like domains. Although JAM-3 did not undergo homophilic interactions, myelo-monocytic cells adhered to immobilized JAM-3 or to JAM-3âtransfected cells. This heterophilic interaction was specifically attributed to a direct interaction of JAM-3 with the Î²2-integrin Mac-1 and to a lower extent with p150.95 (Î±XÎ²2, CD11c/CD18) but not with LFA-1 (Î±LÎ²2, CD11a/CD18) or with Î²1-integrins. These results were corroborated by analysis of K562 erythroleukemic cells transfected with different heterodimeric Î²2-integrins and by using purified proteins. Moreover, purified JAM-3 or antibodies against JAM-3 blocked the platelet-neutrophil interaction, indicating that platelet JAM-3 serves as a counterreceptor for Mac-1 mediating leukocyteâplatelet interactions. JAM-3 thereby provides a novel molecular target for antagonizing interactions between vascular cells that promote inflammatory vascular pathologies such as in atherothrombosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Multicellular interactions between leukocytes and the vessel wall play a pivotal role in inflammatory processes or vascular remodeling. Leukocyte recruitment to vascular endo-thelium requires multistep adhesive and signaling events including selectin-mediated rolling, leukocyte activation, and integrin-mediated firm adhesion and diapedesis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). On the leukocytes, members of the Î²2-integrin family, LFA-1 (Î±LÎ²2, CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (Î±MÎ²2, CD11b/CD18), and p150.95 (Î±XÎ²2, CD11c/CD18), as well as Î²1-integrins interact with endothelial counterligands such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), surface-associated fibrinogen (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), or vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, to mediate the described paracellular interactions. At sites of vascular injury, where the endothelial cell lining has been denuded, leukocyte infiltration can occur through interactions with deposited platelets and fibrin (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In vivo studies indeed demonstrated colocalization of both cell types within atherosclerotic and postangioplasty restenotic lesions, or in areas of ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Reminiscent of the leukocyteâendothelium interactions, a sequential adhesion process including leukocyte attachment to and transmigration across surface-adherent platelets, has been proposed: Platelet-P-selectinâmediated initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes through their P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is followed by Mac-1âdependent firm adhesion and transplatelet migration (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Recent data indicated glycoprotein (GP) IbÎ± on platelets as a potential counterreceptor for Mac-1 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, ICAM-2 and Î±IIbÎ²3-associated fibrinogen have also been proposed to mediate Mac-1âdependent plateletâleukocyte interactions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); however, the exact contribution of each system remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Recently, new members of the Ig-superfamily named junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), which mediate cell-to-cell adhesion have been identified on several blood cell populations. JAM-1 is a transmembrane protein which possesses two V-type immunoglobulin domains and is found on endothelial and epithelial cells at sites of cellâcell contacts in particular within tight junctions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). JAM-1 was shown to participate in monocyte transmigration across endothelial cells, and blocking mAbs against JAM-1 were able to inhibit monocyte infiltration and attenuate cytokine-induced meningitis in mice (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Platelet JAM-1 might also be involved in primary hemostasis (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), as cross-linking of JAM-1 with FcÎ³RII resulted in platelet aggregation. Interestingly, human platelet antibodies against JAM-1 were reported in patients with thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Human JAM-1 is also constitutively expressed on circulating monocytes, neutrophils, erythrocytes, and lymphocyte subsets (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Finally, JAM-1 has been described as a receptor for reovirus (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In contrast, JAM-2 (also referred to as VE-JAM) is prominently expressed at intercellular boundaries of the endothelium, particularly in venules (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). JAM-2 is also involved in adhesive processes of lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new member of the JAM family, namely JAM-3, expressed on human platelets, and provide evidence that JAM-3 is a novel counterreceptor for the integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) thereby playing a critical role for plateletâleukocyte interactions.</p>

        <title>Isolation of Gi11 Antigen from Human Platelets.</title>
        <p>Outdated platelet concentrates were used as source for purification of Gi11 antigen. Washed platelets were centrifuged with 3,700 <italic>g</italic> at 4Â°C for 45 min, and the pellet was resuspended to 10<sup>10</sup> platelets/ml in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2% NP-40, 2 mM Pefabloc, pH 7.8). After solubilization (at 4Â°C for 1 h) cell debris was removed by centrifugation with 17,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4Â°C for 45 min. From the supernatant the solubilized Gi11 antigen was isolated by sequential antibody adsorption steps on nonimmune mouse IgG, mAb w6/32, and mAb Gi11, coupled to Sepharose. Affinity columns were washed with 100 ml washing buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.1% NP-40, pH 7.8; flow rate 50 ml/h) and 270 ml cell supernatant was applied onto the first column with a flow rate of 5â10 ml/h. After sequential washing with (a) 50 ml 0.1 M Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, pH 7.8, (b) 50 ml 1.0 M Tris, 0.1% NP-40, pH 7.8, and (c) 50 ml 0.1 M Tris, 0.1% NP-40, pH 8.0, antigens were eluted from the mAb Gi11 affinity column with 0.05 M diethylamine, 0.1% NP-40, pH 11.5, in 3.0 ml fractions into tubes containing 1 ml 1M Tris, 0.1% NP-40, pH 6.8.

        <title>Generation of JAM-3 Construct.</title>
        <p>30 Î¼l of platelet mRNA were heated to 68Â°C for 10 min and quickly cooled on ice water. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 Î¼l pd(N)<sub>6</sub> primer and first-strand beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of 20 Î¼l were preheated to 90Â°C for 5 min and digested with 2U RNaseH enzyme (GIBCO BRL) at 37Â°C. 20 Î¼l cDNA were diluted with 10Ã PCR buffer, and 3 Î¼l (5 Î¼M) GSP-3 (5â²-<sup>1</sup>ATGGCGCTGAGGCGGCCA<sup>18</sup>-3â²), 3 Î¼l (5 Î¼M) GSP-4 (5â²-<sup>933</sup>TCAGATCACAAACGATGAC<sup>915</sup>-3â²), 8 Î¼l (1.25 mM) dNTP and 2 U Taq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer) were added in a total volume of 50 Î¼l. Amplification was performed on a DNA thermal cycler 480 (PerkinElmer) for 32 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 95Â°C for 30 s, annealing at 50Â°C for 30 s, and extension at 72Â°C for 60 s. In the final cycle, the samples were kept at 72Â°C for 10 min and then chilled to 4Â°C. Amplified JAM-3 cDNA was purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN) and subcloned into the T/A cloning site of the plasmid vector pcDNA4His/Max-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then transformed into the DH5Î± high-efficiency competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (GIBCO BRL).

        <p>CHO cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycine and were transfected with JAM-3 construct by the use of Lipofectamine (GIBCO BRL). In brief, 1 Î¼g of the JAM-3 construct was mixed with 15 Î¼l lipofectamine in 200 Î¼l OptiMEM and then added to subconfluent CHO cells. After 5 h, 2 ml Ham's F12 medium containing 10% FCS was added and the incubation was continued for 48 h. After splitting, stable transfectants were selected with Zeocin (final concentration 200 Î¼g/ml; Invitrogen) for 2 wk and subcloned. Transfectants expressing recombinant JAM-3 were identified by flow cytometry analysis using mAb Gi11. A positive clone was enriched by the use of MACS MicroBeads coupled with goat antiâmouse IgG (Miltenyi Biotec).</p>

        <p>Cell adhesion to JAM-3, fibrinogen (Kabivitrum) or BSA (as control) coated plates was tested as described previously (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 10 Î¼g/ml JAM-3 or fibrinogen (in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6), respectively, and blocked with 3% BSA solution. U937 cells, which had been differentiated for 24 h in the presence of vitamin D3 (100 nM; Biomol) and transforming growth factor-Î² (2 ng/ml; R&amp;D Systems), or K562 cells were washed in serum-free RPMI and plated onto the precoated wells (10<sup>5</sup>/well) at 37Â°C for 60 min in the absence or presence of inhibitors. After the incubation period, the wells were washed and adherent cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at 4Â°C for 30 min.

Briefly, nontransfected CHO or JAM-3âtransfected CHO cells were grown to confluency onto 96-well plates. Human platelets (1.5 Ã 10<sup>7</sup>/well) were added to microtiter plates precoated with 0.2% gelatin. After 1 h at 37Â°C unbound platelets were removed. Fluorescence labeled neutrophils (10<sup>5</sup>/well), differentiated U937 cells or K562 cells were washed twice followed by no pretreatment or stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 50 ng/ml) or the Î²2-integrin stimulating mAb Kim127 (10 Î¼g/ml). Cells were washed and added to immobilized JAM-3, platelets or to CHO cells at 37Â°C for 60 min in the absence or presence of inhibitors. After washing, adhesion of neutrophils, U937, or K562 cells was quantified as the percentage of total cells added using a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek). When purified JAM-3 was used as a competitor in both adhesion assays the final concentration of NP-40 in the buffer was less than 0.005% and did not affect the assay at all.</p>

Binding of ICAM-1 (10 Î¼g/ml), JAM-3 (0â15 Î¼g/ml), or biotinylated fibrinogen (2 Î¼g/ml) to the immobilized integrin was performed in a final volume of 50 Î¼l (HEPES buffer supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. After incubation at 22Â°C for 2 h and a washing step, bound JAM-3 was detected by biotinylated mAb Gi11 and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:2,000 dilution; Dako), bound ICAM-1 was detected by appropriate mAb and peroxidase-conjugated goat antiâmouse immunoglobulin (1:2,000 dilution; Dako). Biotinylated fibrinogen was detected directly with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (see above). Bound antibodies or streptavidin were quantified using 2,2â²-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate(6)] as substrate (Boehringer Mannheim) in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as blank and was subtracted to calculate specific binding.</p>

        <title>Analysis of the Platelet JAM-3 Amino Acid Sequence.</title>
        <p>Platelet JAM-3 is encoded by a mRNA of 1740 bases that encodes a protein of 310 amino acids with a signal sequence corresponding to amino acids 1â31. JAM-3 is a type I integral membrane protein with an extracellular amino-terminus (residues 32â310), a transmembrane domain (residues 245â267), and a cytoplasmic oriented carboxy-terminus (residues 268â310). Furthermore, the protein contains two potential N-glycosylation (Asn<sub>104</sub>, Asn<sub>192</sub>) sites and one potential O-glycosylation site (Thr<sub>60</sub>). The cytoplasmic tail contains three potential phosphorylation sites (Tyr<sub>270,282, 293</sub>) and a putative phosphorylation site for casein kinase II (Thr<sub>296</sub>) or protein kinase C (Ser<sub>281</sub>). At the extreme carboxy-terminus, a potential binding motif for PDZ domains is apparent. JAM-3 exhibits two regions (amino acids 44â122 and 151â226) of high homology to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Based on the analysis using the SMART program these two regions represent C2-type immunoglobulin domains.</p>

Human JAM-3 is more closely related to murine JAM-2 than to murine JAM-1 or murine JAM-3. Murine JAM-3 is related to human JAM-2 (79% homology), whereas murine JAM-1 is related to human JAM-1 (67% homology).

        <p>To examine the expression of JAM-3 in various peripheral blood cells, the surface expression of JAM-3 on platelets, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes isolated from healthy blood donors was analyzed by flow cytometry using mAb Gi11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>)

Quantitative determination demonstrated that platelets possess 1594 Â± 303 copies (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of JAM-3 on their surface. Analysis with myeloid cell lines (K562, U937, HL-60, HEL VJ20, MEG-01, KG1a, and Dami) indicated that JAM-3 is only expressed on megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01, Dami, and KG1a cells, but not on K562 and U937 cells (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).

This adhesion was abolished by an antibody against JAM-3 and a blocking mAb against Î²2-integrin, whereas a blocking mAb against Î²1-integrin had no effect. Moreover, U937 cell adhesion to immobilized JAM-3 could be inhibited by a blocking mAb against Mac-1 or by the Mac-1 ligand fibrinogen, whereas a blocking mAb against LFA-1 or p150.95 did not affect cell adhesion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>

The same pattern of interaction between JAM-3 and Mac-1 was identified when the adhesion of U937 cells to JAM-3 transfected CHO cells was tested. The efficiency of cell-to-cell adhesion was almost doubled in the presence of PMA, a known activator of integrins, and adhesion was inhibited by mAb against the common Î²2-subunit or Mac-1, but not by mAbs against LFA-1, p150.95, or Î²1-integrins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C). In any case, nontransfected CHO cells did not present any appreciable adhesion. In these experiments, cell adhesion was not only inhibited by the blocking Mac-1 mAb LPM19c, but also by the mAb CBRM1/5, as the CBRM1/5 activation-dependent epitope was expressed on differentiated and PMA-stimulated U937 cells (unpublished data).

Whereas nontransfected K562 cells or LFA-1 transfectants did not show any significant adhesion to JAM-3 both under unstimulated or stimulated conditions (with PMA or the stimulating antibody Kim127), K562 cells expressing Mac-1 or p150.95 adhered to immobilized JAM-3 especially in the presence of the Î²2-integrin stimulating antibody Kim127 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>

        <title>JAM-3 Directly Binds to Mac-1.</title>
        <p>As the previous observations suggested a direct molecular interaction between the Î²2-integrin Mac-1 and JAM-3, the direct binding of JAM-3 to immobilized purified Mac-1 in comparison to LFA-1 was analyzed. JAM-3 directly bound to Mac-1, and this binding was similar in its extent to the binding of ICAM-1 or fibrinogen, which both are known ligands for Mac-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>
A). Moreover, binding of JAM-3 to Mac-1 presented a saturable dose-dependency (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B) and was inhibited by a mAb against Mac-1 and a mAb against JAM-3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). In contrast, no specific binding of JAM-3 to immobilized LFA-1 was identified, whereas the expected binding of ICAM-1 to LFA-1 was apparent (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). As fibrinogen was shown to inhibit the Mac-1âdependent adhesion of U937 cells to immobilized JAM-3 (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A), the possibility that the two Mac-1 ligands, fibrinogen, and JAM-3, may compete for each other was tested. Fibrinogen inhibited the binding of JAM-3 to immobilized Mac-1, and vice versa, JAM-3 blocked the interaction between fibrinogen and Mac-1, indicative for overlapping binding sites of both ligands on Mac-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). This observation was further strengthened by demonstrating a direct interaction between JAM-3 and the purified I-domain of Mac-1 (unpublished data), which also constitutes the major binding site for fibrinogen.</p>

        <p>In a recent report, Simon et al. (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) demonstrated that platelet GPIbÎ± serves as a potential counter-receptor for leukocyte Mac-1. However, the presence of additional Mac-1 ligands on the surface of platelets was not ruled out. To establish that JAM-3 can facilitate the interaction between platelets and leukocytes, the adhesion of neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers or U937 cells to surface-adherent platelets was analyzed. PMA- or fMLP-stimulated neutrophil adhesion to surface-adherent platelets was abolished in the presence of a mAb against Mac-1 but not mAb against LFA-1 or p150.95 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>
A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Individual antibodies against JAM-3, mAb Gi13, or rabbit antiâJAM-3, or anti-GPIbÎ± antibody partially reduced adhesion of neutrophils to platelets, and the combination of both antibodies completely abolished binding of neutrophils to platelets, suggesting that JAM-3 and GPIbÎ± on the platelet surface together serve as the predominant counterreceptors for Mac-1. Moreover, the addition of purified JAM-3 could completely inhibit binding of neutrophils to surface-adherent platelets (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), an effect that appeared to be comparable to the inhibitory capacity of soluble glycocalicin in the same system. Blocking other potential Mac-1 ligands such as Î±IIbÎ²3-bound fibrinogen or ICAM-2 had no effect on the neutrophilâplatelet interaction (unpublished data). Similar results were obtained when adhesion of U937 cells to platelets was examined (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>To further define the contribution of JAM-3 in mediating plateletâleukocyte interactions, the binding of neutrophils or U937 cells to surface-adherent platelets from a patient with Bernard-Soulier-Syndrome (BSS) was assessed. The particular patient has a homozygous Asn45Ser mutation in the GPIX gene leading to only 20% GPIb/IX surface expression compared with normal subjects (unpublished data). Adhesion of neutrophils to BSS-platelets was significantly reduced as compared with normal platelets (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B). In this case the inhibitory capacity of mAb against GPIbÎ± was hardly discernible, whereas the blocking mAb against JAM-3 abolished the Mac-1âdependent adhesion of neutrophils. Also, purified JAM-3 blocked the neutrophil interaction with BSS-platelets. Similar results were obtained with U937 cells (unpublished data). Taken together, these data indicate that JAM-3, by binding to Mac-1, facilitates the heterotypic interaction between leukocytes and platelets. Thus, JAM-3 and GPIbÎ± together serve as the major Mac-1 counterreceptors on the platelet surface.</p>

        <title>Relevance of JAM-3 in PlateletâLeukocyte Aggregates in Whole Blood.</title>
        <p>To further substantiate the physiological relevance of the interaction between JAM-3 and Mac-1 the ex vivo detection of plateletâneutrophil aggregates from whole blood was performed in a micro-couette both under conditions of low and high shear. The formation of these aggregates was almost completely abolished in the presence of antibody against P-selectin. Soluble glycocalicin reduced the aggregate formation under both conditions of low and high shear rate, whereas purified JAM-3 provided a significant inhibition only under conditions of low shear (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>)

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Leukocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation or infection depends on the interactions of these mobile cells with the vessel wall, reactions which are largely controlled by the degree and duration of adhesive contacts of the involved cell types. In particular, leukocytes interact with the intact endothelium or with deposited platelets and fibrin at sites of vascular injury after denudation of the endothelial cell lining. Upon certain pathological conditions leukocytes and platelets colocalize in the vessel wall (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A sequential adhesion model of leukocyte attachment to and transmigration across surface-adherent platelets has been proposed, including P-selectin-mediated initial rolling (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and the subsequent Mac-1âdependent firm adhesion and transplatelet migration (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, the potential platelet counterreceptors for Mac-1 are only partially identified. In this study, a third member of the family of junctional adhesion molecules, JAM-3, was characterized as a novel counterreceptor on platelets for leukocyte Mac-1. Together with GPIbÎ±, JAM-3 serves as the major heterotypic adhesion receptor responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion between platelets and leukocytes.</p>
      <p>In particular, two mAb Gi11 and Gi13 had been raised against a 43-kD glycoprotein on human platelets and these tools allowed the identification of a full-length cDNA encoding a 279-amino acid mature protein. This type I integral membrane glycoprotein reveals two domains with intrachain disulfide bonds at the extracellular region, typical for Ig-loops of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is identical with the very recently described human JAM-3 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Multiple sequence alignments of the protein revealed the highest amino acid identity (86%) with murine JAM-2 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), whereas the homology between murine JAM-3 and human JAM-2 was 79%. Thus, murine JAM-2 represents the mouse counterpart of human JAM-3 and vice versa, murine JAM-3 is the mouse counterpart of human JAM-2. The analysis of different peripheral blood cell populations and cell lines indicated that JAM-3 is exclusively expressed on platelets or megakaryoblastic cell lines.</p>
      <p>A possible engagement of JAM-3 in homophilic cellular interactions could hardly be identified, as opposed to the properties of two previously described members of the JAM family (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the following features of JAM-3 are consistent with a specific heterophilic interaction with leukocyte Î²2-integrin Mac-1: (a) Myelomonocytic U937 cells adhered to immobilized JAM-3 or JAM-3 transfected cells and this interaction was attributed to Mac-1. (b) Analyzing adhesion of K562 cells transfected with different Î²2-integrins to either immobilized JAM-3 or JAM-3-transfected cells further established that JAM-3 interacts with Mac-1 but not with LFA-1. K562 cells bearing a third Î²2-integrin, p150.95, also interacted with JAM-3, which is not surprising as p150.95 and Mac-1 share many similarities in ligand binding (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Although U937 cells and neutrophils express p150.95 integrin, the adhesion of U937 cells to immobilized JAM-3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), the adhesion of neutrophils to purified JAM-3 (unpublished data), or the adhesion of neutrophils to surface-adherent platelets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) was not affected by a blocking mAb against p150.95. Similarly, anti-p150.95 did not impair adhesion of U937 cells to fibrinogen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These observations indicate that p150.95 is not sufficient to mediate adhesion to JAM-3 when coexpressed with Mac-1. Thus, Mac-1 serves as the predominant counter-receptor of JAM-3. (c) In a purified system, a direct binding between JAM-3 and Mac-1 was observed. JAM-3 was particularly found to recognize the I-domain of Mac-1 (unpublished data) and JAM-3 and fibrinogen competed with each other for binding to Mac-1, suggesting overlapping binding sites on the Î²2-integrin. Conversely, the exact binding epitope(s) for Mac-1 on JAM-3 remain to be identified. (d) A major consequence for JAM-3 binding to Mac-1 is a firm plateletâleukocyte interaction. In this respect, antibodies to both JAM-3 and GPIbÎ±, each partially inhibited the interaction of human neutrophils with surface-adherent platelets, whereas a combination of both antibodies totally abolished the cellâcell interaction. In addition, either purified JAM-3 or GPIbÎ± alone almost completely inhibited the platelet-leukocyte interaction, probably because each ligand may block binding sites on Mac-1 for both JAM-3 and GPIbÎ±. Furthermore, neutrophil interaction with platelets derived from a BSS-patient was markedly reduced, compared with normal platelets, and interestingly, neutrophil adhesion to BSS-platelets was almost completely blocked by the antibody against JAM-3. Thus, under our experimental conditions, JAM-3 and GPIbÎ± are the major mediators of neutrophil-platelet adhesive contacts. (e) The physiological relevance of our findings was substantiated by identifying a role for JAM-3 in mediating plateletâleukocyte aggregates in whole blood. Whereas soluble glycocalicin blocked aggregate formation under both low and high shear rate, purified JAM-3 was effective only under low shear rate. Hence, JAM-3 mediates adhesion of neutrophils to platelets under low shear conditions; i.e., it might strengthen the neutrophil-platelet interaction already mediated by other Mac-1 ligands on platelets. However, a potential contribution of JAM-3 in the accumulation of neutrophils to surface-adherent platelets under physiological flow conditions cannot be excluded from the data presented here.</p>
      <p>Although we found no participation of other adhesionâreceptor systems in firm adhesion of neutrophils to platelets, the possibility of additional Mac-1âdependent and âindependent binding sites on platelets cannot be ruled out. Other potential Mac-1 ligands present on the platelet membrane include fibrinogen (bound to GPIIb-IIIa; reference <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), ICAM-2 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), high molecular weight kininogen (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), or glycosaminoglycans (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In particular, the functional relevance of fibrinogen and ICAM-2 as Mac-1 counterreceptors appears to increase with higher shear (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Further detailed functional analysis of the contribution of each platelet associated Mac-1 ligand in platelet/neutrophil interactions under different shear conditions will provide clarification in this respect. Interactions contributing to Mac-1âindependent leukocyteâplatelet aggregate formation include thrombospondin bridging between GPIV receptors on platelets and monocytes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) or binding of P-selectin on activated platelets to leukocyte PSGL-1 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to mediating the accumulation of leukocytes at sites of platelet deposition within regions of the injured vasculature, the juxtacrine interaction between neutrophils and platelets can induce upregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) or promote integrin activation (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), chemokine synthesis (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and induction of the respiratory burst (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Interestingly, both neutrophilâplatelet and monocyteâplatelet aggregates have been identified in the peripheral blood of patients with coronary artery disease and may be markers of disease activity (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Thus, the possibility that the described interaction between JAM-3 and Mac-1 contributes to such processes is intriguing and is currently under investigation.</p>
      <p>Recently, evidence is accumulating that JAM family members possess important features for cellular communications between endothelium and leukocytes during the inflammatory process. For example, JAM-1 was shown to facilitate the transmigration of neutrophils and monocytes across the vessel wall (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). JAM-1 is also proposed to modulate paracellular permeability (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), as it associates with the tight junction components ZO-1 and AF-6 via their PDZ domains (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). As the PDZ binding motif is conserved in JAM-3, future investigations will focus on a putative role for JAM-3 in endothelial barrier function. In contrast to JAM-1, which has already been implicated in single patients with immune thrombocytopenia, JAM-3 does not represent a major target for platelet antibodies as almost 1,000 patients with various forms of immune thrombocytopenia were negative for JAM-3âreactive antibodies (unpublished data).</p>
      <p>Due to the fact that JAM-1 has been shown to undergo homophilic binding interactions, the propensity of dimerization (or multimerization) has been suggested. However, a recent report points to the role of JAM-1 also in heterophilic interactions by demonstrating its binding to the Î²2-integrin LFA-1 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The observation that JAM-1 and JAM-3 can independently function as counterreceptors for the Î²2-integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1, respectively, provides a completely new perspective in understanding alternative processes responsible for the (patho-)physiology of inflammatory cell recruitment.</p>
      <p>Taken together, this study reports the characterization of a novel member of the JAM family, JAM-3 from human platelets, which constitutes a specific counterreceptor for leukocyte Mac-1 and thereby contributes as a major adhesion molecule in the plateletâleukocyte interaction. Future studies will also aim to further characterize the molecular anatomy of the JAM-3/Mac-1 interaction and to identify novel strategies that could disrupt plateletâleukocyte complexes in order to device therapeutic interventions in atherothrombosis and postangioplasty restenosis.</p>
