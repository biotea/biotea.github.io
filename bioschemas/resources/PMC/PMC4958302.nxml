        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Centriole duplication is a tightly ordered process during which procentrioles are assembled in G1-S and elongate during S and G2. Here, we show that human CEP295 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Ana1) is not essential for initial cartwheel assembly, but is required to build distal half centrioles during S and G2. Using super-resolution and immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrate that CEP295 is recruited to the proximal end of procentrioles in early S phase, when it is also localized at the centriolar microtubule wall that surrounds the human SAS6 cartwheel hub. Interestingly, depletion of CEP295 not only inhibits the recruitments of POC5 and POC1B to the distal half centrioles in G2, resulting in shorter centrioles, it also blocks the post-translational modification of centriolar microtubules (e.g. acetylation and glutamylation). Importantly, our results indicate that CEP295 directly interacts with microtubules, and that excess CEP295 could induce the assembly of overly long centrioles. Furthermore, exogenous expression of the N-terminal domain of CEP295 exerts a dominant-negative effect on centriole elongation. Collectively, these findings suggest that CEP295 is essential for building the distal half centrioles and for post-translational modification of centriolar microtubules.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Centrioles are microtubule-based cylinders that form centrosomes, which are the major microtubule organizing centers of animal cells, and are vital for many cellular and developmental processes. Centriole duplication comprises three major steps; initiation, elongation, and maturation (<xref rid="JCS186338C2" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C17" ref-type="bibr">Jana et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have identified a number of conserved proteins, e.g. PLK4, human SAS6 (also known as SASS6 and hereafter referred to as hSAS6), STIL, CEP135, CPAP (also known as CENPJ) and CEP120, which are essential for cartwheel formation and procentriole assembly during the early stage of centriole duplication in mammalian cells (<xref rid="JCS186338C7" ref-type="bibr">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C24" ref-type="bibr">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C25" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>,<xref rid="JCS186338C26" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C20" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C22" ref-type="bibr">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C31" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C33" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="JCS186338C34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, we do not yet understand the molecular mechanism through which a full-length centriole is generated, nor do we know the hierarchical order of the proteins that participate in the later stages of centriole elongation.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein, Ana1, is reportedly required for centriole duplication (<xref rid="JCS186338C4" ref-type="bibr">Blachon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C8" ref-type="bibr">Dobbelaere et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C12" ref-type="bibr">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>). Its possible human homolog, CEP295 (also known as KIAA1731), shares 15% amino acid identity (27% similarity) throughout the primary sequence (<xref rid="JCS186338C21" ref-type="bibr">Knorz et al., 2010</xref>), and was recently reported to be required for centriole-to-centrosome conversion in mitosis (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C16" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). However, the role of CEP295 in centriole duplication remains obscure. Here, we report a newly identified role for CEP295 in centriole duplication, and offer a mechanistic basis for this effect. We demonstrate that CEP295 directly interacts with microtubules and that excess CEP295 could induce overly long centrioles. Furthermore, we show that CEP295 is essential for building the distal half centrioles and required for post-translational modification of centriolar microtubules during centriole assembly.</p>

        <title>Depletion of CEP295 produces shorter centrioles</title>
        <p>CEP295 is reportedly essential for centriole formation (<xref rid="JCS186338C21" ref-type="bibr">Knorz et al., 2010</xref>) and for the centriole-to-centrosome conversion (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C16" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, the loss of CEP295 seemed to have no effect on initial cartwheel assembly in interphase cells (<xref rid="JCS186338C16" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this finding, our results showed that CEP295 depletion did not inhibit the early recruitment of centriolar proteins (e.g. hSAS6, STIL, CPAP, CP110 and centrin) to new-born procentrioles in U2OS cells in early S phase (data not shown). Thus, we examined whether the loss of CEP295 might affect centriole elongation during late S/G2 phase. CEP295-depleted (siCEP295) or control (sicontrol) U2OS cells were synchronized at G2 phase (when the duplicated centrosomes could be clearly visualized as separate from each other) and immunostained with antibodies against acetylated-tubulin (Ac-tub, a stabilized centriole marker; <xref rid="JCS186338C29" ref-type="bibr">Piperno et al., 1987</xref>) and CEP162 (a known centriole distal-end marker; <xref rid="JCS186338C36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Our results revealed that depletion of CEP295 did not affect the localization or intensity of CEP162 at the centrioles during G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>A) (<xref rid="JCS186338C16" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the intensity of Ac-tub at the nascent centrioles was substantially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>A, arrow). We then measured the distance between two CEP162 dots located at the distal ends of paired centrioles (one on the mother centriole, the other on the procentriole) in G2-stage cells using the method described by <xref rid="JCS186338C3" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh et al. (2009)</xref>. The mean distance between the two CEP162 dots in CEP295-depleted cells (meanÂ±s.d.; 0.54Â±0.10âÎ¼m) was significantly less than that of control cells (0.80Â±0.05âÎ¼m), indicating that the procentriole length was reduced in CEP295-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B). Consistent with this finding, CEP295 depletion also produced multiple shortened centrioles in PLK4-inducible cells, which were treated as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>C and examined by immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>D) and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>E). Further electron microscopy analysis showed that the average length of a procentriole in sicontrol cells was 224.0ânm, whereas that in CEP295-depleted cells was 107.3ânm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>F). The diameter of the mother centriole was not significantly different between sicontrol cells (â¼188.3ânm) and CEP295-depleted cells (â¼189.6ânm), whereas the diameter of the procentriole (daughter) was much smaller in CEP295-depleted cells (â¼145.9ânm) compared with control cells (â¼176.3ânm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>G). We also generated U2OS-derived cell lines expressing a full-length siRNA-resistant GFPâCEP295R construct (hereafter referred to as G-CEP295R) under the control of doxycycline (Dox). Our results showed that the phenotype of shorter centrioles in CEP295-depleted cells could be effectively rescued by exogenous expression of a G-CEP295R construct (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S1</uri>). Together, our results suggest that CEP295 is not essential for initial cartwheel assembly during procentriole formation, but that its depletion could produce shortened centrioles with reduced diameters.

        <title>CEP295 is located at the microtubule wall and enriched at the proximal ends of centrioles</title>
        <p>To finely map the localization of CEP295 and examine its spatial correlation with other centriolar proteins during centriole elongation, we performed three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and immunogold electron microscopy. U2OS cells were synchronized at early S or G2 phase and analyzed by 3D-SIM using the indicated antibodies. The top-down views of early S- or G2-centrioles showed CEP295 forming a ring-like pattern that embraces the cartwheel protein, hSAS6, at the proximal end of the procentriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>A, arrow). Meanwhile, side-view images of CEP295 often revealed a two-dot shape with hSAS6 in the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>A, arrowhead). Further immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the CEP295 signals were concentrated in regions surrounding the centriolar cylinder, as assessed by labeling with Ac-tub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>B), glutamylated tubulin (Glu-tub; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>C), and CPAP (an inner centriolar lumen marker; <xref rid="JCS186338C20" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>D). Consistent with our findings, <xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al. (2016)</xref> also reported that CEP295 closely surrounds the proximal part of the microtubule wall. Interestingly, centrobin, a known daughter-centriole-enriched protein (<xref rid="JCS186338C37" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2005</xref>) was localized distal to CEP295 on growing centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>E, arrow). Notably, our immunogold electron microscopy analysis directly demonstrated that the CEP295-specific gold particles clustered largely at the proximal end of centriolar microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>F). Collectively, our results indicate that CEP295 is localized at the centriolar microtubule wall and is especially enriched at the proximal ends of the centrioles.

To examine whether CEP295 is required for the process of centriole elongation, we treated CPAP- or CEP120-inducible cells with sicontrol or siCEP295 (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S2</uri>).

Intriguingly, nearly 44.0% of CEP295-depleted cells presented with a single mature mother centriole that was positive for CEP164 (a distal appendage marker; <xref rid="JCS186338C13" ref-type="bibr">Graser et al., 2007</xref>) (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S2Bii</uri>), whereas the remaining cells contained either two short centrioles (â¼47.9%; <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S2Biii</uri>) or a single long CEP164-labeled centriole (â¼0.6%; <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S2Biv</uri>).

        <title>CEP295 is required for the construction of full-length centrioles and the post-translational modification of centriolar microtubules</title>
        <p>Recent work showed that POC5 is recruited to centrioles during G2/M and is essential for building the distal portions of centrioles (<xref rid="JCS186338C3" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we examined whether CEP295 depletion affected the localization of POC5 to the distal half centrioles. U2OS cells were treated using the protocol as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig. 3</xref>A. Our results showed that depletion of CEP295 substantially inhibited the targeting of POC5 to nascent centrioles in G2-phase U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>B, arrow). Moreover, these effects were rescued by exogenous expression of a siRNA-resistant G-CEP295R construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig.Â 3C-3F</xref>). A similar phenotype with loss of POC5 was also observed in siCEP295-treated PLK4-inducible cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>Gi). Interestingly, CEP295 depletion also suppressed the recruitment of POC1B, a possible later-born centriolar protein that might control centriole length (<xref rid="JCS186338C19" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2009</xref>), to the G2-nascent centrioles of PLK4-inducible cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>Gii). The relative intensities of POC5 and POC1B at the new-born centrioles in siCEP295-treated PLK4-inducible cells are shown in <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S3A and B</uri>, respectively. Furthermore, the post-translational modification of centriolar microtubules (e.g. acetylation and glutamylation), which is believed to stabilize centrioles, is known to occur during centriole assembly (<xref rid="JCS186338C5" ref-type="bibr">Bobinnec et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C18" ref-type="bibr">Janke, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C29" ref-type="bibr">Piperno et al., 1987</xref>).

        <title>Characterizing the functional domains of CEP295: microtubule interaction and centrosome targeting</title>
        <p>Our immunogold results showing that CEP295 is located at the centriolar walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>F) led us to speculate that CEP295 might associate with microtubules. To test this possibility, we transfected GFP-tagged full-length CEP295 into HEK 293T cells and performed immunofluorescence microscopy using the indicated antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>, exogenously expressed GFPâCEP295 colocalized with CEP135 at the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>A, arrow). A substantial portion of the highly expressed GFPâCEP295 was strongly associated with not only interphase microtubules (in 46/67 transfected cells, 68.6%), but also mitotic spindles (15/15, 100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>A). A microtubule co-sedimentation assay demonstrated that endogenous CEP295 co-sedimented with microtubules <italic>in vivo</italic> in the presence of Taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>B). To determine the possible microtubule-associating region of CEP295, we transfected HEK 293T cells with various GFP-tagged CEP295 fragments (Fig. 4D) and conducted the microtubule co-sedimentation analyses. Unexpectedly, we did not find evidence of a single specific microtubule-associating region in CEP295; instead, we found two such regions. Both N-terminal (GFPâK1, residues 1â560) and C-terminal (GFPâK6, residues 2055â2601) fragments of CEP295 were efficiently co-precipitated with microtubules and detected in the pellet fractions, whereas the middle regions (K3, K4 and K5) showed only partial associations with microtubules and were found in both supernatant and pellet fractions in the presence of Taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>C). Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that GFPâK1 (50/119, 42%) and GFPâK6 (125/130, 96%), but not the middle fragments, colocalized with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>E). These results suggest that the major microtubule-associating regions of CEP295 are located in the N-terminal K1 fragment and the C-terminal K6 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>D). Furthermore, in agreement with Knorz's report (<xref rid="JCS186338C21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), we also mapped the centrosome-targeting region of CEP295 to the N-terminal region, which colocalized with the centrosome marker, CEP192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>E, arrow).

        <p>To more precisely map which regions of K1 and K6 could directly bind to microtubules, we subdivided K1 into the K1N and K1C sub-fragments, and K6 into the K6N and K6C sub-fragments (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4A</uri>). We generated GST-fused constructs, affinity purified the GSTârecombinant proteins, and performed microtubule sedimentation assays as previously described (<xref rid="JCS186338C15" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 2008</xref>). Of the tested fragments, only GSTâK6C bound to and co-sedimented with polymerized microtubules in the pellet fraction (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4Biii</uri>). In agreement with this, GFP-tagged K6C also showed a strong association with microtubules in transfected cells (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4C</uri>). Unexpectedly, GSTâK1N (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4Bi</uri>), GSTâK1C (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4Bi</uri>), and GSTâK6N (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4B-ii</uri>) were prone to auto-precipitating in tubulin-free solution, so we were unable to determine whether their microtubule interactions were direct or indirect. Nonetheless, our findings clearly demonstrate that the C-terminal CEP295-K6C fragment (residues 2472â2601) could directly interact with microtubules (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4A,Biii</uri>). Intriguingly, CEP295-K6C harbors a conserved ALMS motif (<xref rid="JCS186338C6" ref-type="bibr">Collin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C21" ref-type="bibr">Knorz et al., 2010</xref>) of unknown function. We thus speculate that the ALMS motifs of CEP295 and other ALMS-containing proteins (e.g. ALMS1 and C10orf90) might mediate an interaction with microtubules. Furthermore, a modified (nt 1â2472) G-CEP295R construct lacking the ALMS motif (G-CEP295R<sup>1â2472</sup>) could not fully rescue the phenotype of short-length centrioles in siCEP295-treated cells (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S1A,C</uri>), implying that the ALMS motif is essential for the full activity of CEP295-mediated centriole elongation.</p>
        <p>To examine whether the microtubule interaction or the centrosomal localization regions of CEP295 are essential for centriole elongation, we transiently transfected vectors encoding full-length GFPâCEP295, GFPâK1, GFPâK2â5, or GFPâK6 into CEP120-inducible cells. We observed that the CEP120-induced formation of overly long centrioles was substantially inhibited in cells expressing GFPâK1, but not GFPâK2â5 or GFPâK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>A). Interestingly, excess GFPâK1 also substantially suppressed the recruitment of endogenous CEP295 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>B), CEP120 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F5">(Fig. 5C)</xref> and CPAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>D) to centrioles. Based on these findings, we conclude that the N-terminus of CEP295 (K1 fragment) is essential for its centriole-elongating activity. We further speculate that excess K1 might exert a dominant-negative effect by competing with endogenous CEP295 for proper localization and microtubule association.

        <p>Recently, several centriolar proteins (CPAP, CEP120, SPICE, CEP135 and centrobin) were reported to play essential roles in centriole duplication and elongation (<xref rid="JCS186338C7" ref-type="bibr">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C14" ref-type="bibr">Gudi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C22" ref-type="bibr">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C25" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>,<xref rid="JCS186338C26" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C31" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C33" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2009</xref>).

However, the rosettes seemed smaller than those in control cells, possibly reflecting the shortening centrioles observed in CEP295-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>F). Importantly, we found that depletion of CPAP, but not CEP120, centrobin or SPICE, substantially blocked the targeting of CEP295 to centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>D). Furthermore, our results showed that depletion of CEP135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>A,C) perturbs the recruitment of CEP295 to the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>A) and CEP295 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>B,C) also perturbs CEP135 targeting to the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>B). A similar finding has independently been reported by <xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al. (2016)</xref>. Unexpectedly, our co-IP experiments did not reveal a strong association between CPAP and CEP295 (data not shown). In contrast, it was reported that CEP135 could directly bind to CEP295 and CEP135 seems to load slightly ahead of CEP295 in interphase centrosomes (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, our results strongly support a model that CPAP and CEP135 might serve as upstream effectors that are required for the recruitment of CEP295 to procentrioles, whereas CEP295 recruitment is possibly mediated by a direct interaction with CEP135.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>We and others have previously shown that CEP135 is required for centriole duplication and that depletion of CEP135 significantly reduced centriole numbers in human cells (<xref rid="JCS186338C20" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C25" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>). We further demonstrated that CEP135 binds to hSAS6 and CPAP, and is required for centriole assembly (<xref rid="JCS186338C25" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>). Interestingly, CEP295 was reported to be directly interacted with CEP135 and CEP152, and such an interaction is essential for centriole-to-centrosome conversion (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), yet the role of CEP295 in centriole assembly is not clear.</p>
      <p>We herein show that CEP295 directly interacts with microtubules through its ALMS-containing domain, K6C (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.186338.supplemental">Fig.Â S4A</uri>), localizes to the centriolar microtubule wall at the proximal ends of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>F), and is required for the generation of the distal half centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>). Our data and that from other groups collectively suggest a possible role for CEP295 in the centriole assembly of vertebrate cells. In this proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>D), centriole assembly starts during late G1/early S phase after PLK4âSTIL activation, which initiates the assembly of the cartwheel with hSAS6 at the central hub (<xref rid="JCS186338C1" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C9" ref-type="bibr">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C20" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C23" ref-type="bibr">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C27" ref-type="bibr">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C32" ref-type="bibr">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C34" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C35" ref-type="bibr">Vulprecht et al., 2012</xref>). CEP135 directly binds to hSAS6 and CPAP, linking the cartwheel to the outer microtubules (<xref rid="JCS186338C25" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>). CPAP then cooperates with CEP120 to promote the assembly of nine triplet microtubules and the extension of procentrioles during S/G2 phase (<xref rid="JCS186338C7" ref-type="bibr">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C22" ref-type="bibr">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C26" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C31" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C33" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). During early S phase, CEP295 is possibly recruited in a CPAP- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>D) and CEP135-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>A) manner to the proximal end of procentrioles at the centriolar microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>F), possibly through direct interaction with CEP135 (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Our results showed that CPAP and CEP135 might act as upstream effectors of CEP295, as loss of either CPAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>D) or CEP135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>A) (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>) seem to suppress the recruitment of CEP295 to centrioles. Depletion of CEP295 blocks the incorporation of POC5 and POC1B into the distal portion of centrioles and suppresses the post-translational modification of centriolar microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>G). Our study thus uncovers a new role for CEP295 during centriole elongation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, CEP295/Ana1 was also reported to be required for centriole-to-centrosome conversion during mitotic progression in flies and humans (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="JCS186338C16" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). It seems that CEP295 might play two distinct roles during cell cycle progression. In interphase (early S phase), CEP295 is first recruited to the proximal end of procentrioles in a CPAP- and CEP135-dependent manner. The successful loading of CEP295 to the procentrioles is required for building the distal half of centrioles in late interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F3">Fig. 3</xref>G). While in mitosis, CEP295/Ana1 could directly recruit CEP152 or its <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog, Asl, to new centrioles for the conversion of centrioles to centrosomes (<xref rid="JCS186338C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the architectural network of CPAPâCEP135âCEP295 is essential for building distal half centrioles in interphase, whereas the CEP135âCEP295âCEP152 network is essential for centriole-to-centrosome conversion in mitosis. Finally, the overly long centriole-like filaments induced by overexpression of CEP295, or CPAP and/or CEP120 exhibit both common and different patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS186338F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>D), implying that CEP295 has a unique role for the later process of centriole elongation. The underlined mechanism is currently under investigation.</p>

        <p>The cDNA encoding full-length CEP295, which was obtained from Dr Thomas Hearn (<xref rid="JCS186338C21" ref-type="bibr">Knorz et al., 2010</xref>), was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). To generate the siRNA-resistant CEP295 construct, the siRNA-targeted nucleotides within wild-type CEP295 (5â²-G ACT GTT AGT GAA ATT GAG AGT AAA) were partially replaced without changing the amino acid sequence (to 5â²- G ACT GTT AGC GAG ATA GAA TCT AAA) using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To construct the various truncated mutants of CEP295, we generated cDNAs encoding various portions of CEP295 and fused them in-frame to pEGFP-C1 or pGEX4T-1.</p>
        <p>To produce a rabbit polyclonal antibody against CEP295, we generated a cDNA encoding amino acids 2092â2430 of CEP295 and inserted it in-frame into the GST cassette of pGEX4T-1. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against CEP295 was raised using recombinant GSTâCEP295 (residues 2092â2430) and affinity purified using CEP295 (2092â2430)âHis.
