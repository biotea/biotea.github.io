      <abstract>
        <p>The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway plays important roles in the progression of colon cancer. <italic>DACT1</italic> has been identified as a modulator of Wnt signaling through its interaction with Dishevelled (Dvl), a central mediator of both the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. However, the functions of <italic>DACT1</italic> in the WNT/Î²-catenin signaling pathway remain unclear. Here, we present evidence that <italic>DACT1</italic> is an important positive regulator in colon cancer through regulating the stability and sublocation of Î²-catenin. We have shown that <italic>DACT1</italic> promotes cancer cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and enhances the migratory and invasive potential of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the higher expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> not only increases the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of Î²-catenin, but also increases its membrane-associated fraction. The overexpression of <italic>DACT1</italic> leads to the increased accumulation of nonphosphorylated Î²-catenin in the cytoplasm and particularly in the nuclei. We have demonstrated that <italic>DACT1</italic> interacts with GSK-3Î² and Î²-catenin. <italic>DACT1</italic> stabilizes Î²-catenin via <italic>DACT1</italic>-induced effects on GSK-3Î² and directly interacts with Î²-catenin proteins. The level of phosphorylated GSK-3Î² at Ser9 is significantly increased following the elevated expression of <italic>DACT1</italic>. <italic>DACT1</italic> mediates the subcellular localization of Î²-catenin via increasing the level of phosphorylated GSK-3Î² at Ser9 to inhibit the activity of GSK-3Î². Taken together, our study identifies <italic>DACT1</italic> as an important positive regulator in colon cancer and suggests a potential strategy for the therapeutic control of the Î²-catenin-dependent pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mutations and the dysregulated expression of components of the ancient Wnt signaling pathway are linked to oncogenesis in multiple systems, and have been particularly implicated in the initiation of colon cancer <xref rid="pone.0034004-Giles1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Korinek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Malanchi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Morin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Tetsu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Over 90% of colorectal cancers originate from active mutations in the Wnt pathway <xref rid="pone.0034004-Giles1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Mutations have been described in the adenomatous polyposis coli (<italic>APC</italic>) gene in cases of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and this mutation also occurs in a high proportion of sporadic colorectal cancers <xref rid="pone.0034004-AshtonRickardt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Groden1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>APC</italic> mutations represent an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis <xref rid="pone.0034004-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Î²-catenin (official symbol CTNB1) is considered to be a central player in the Wnt signaling pathway. Although Wnt activation can occur through mutations that affect phosphorylation sites within exon 3 of Î²-catenin in a minority of colorectal tumors <xref rid="pone.0034004-Hamada1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Polakis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, many other components of the Wnt signaling pathway contribute to colorectal cancer via dysregulating the activity or localization of Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0034004-Cheon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Moon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The <italic>DACT1</italic> (Dapper1/Dpr1) gene, located at chromosome 14q22.3, encodes a 836 amino acid protein with a putative leucine zipper (LZ) domain in the amino-terminal end and a consensus PDZ binding (PDZ-B) motif in the carboxy-terminal end that allows the <italic>DACT1</italic> protein to interact with the Dishevelled (Dvl) PDZ domain <xref rid="pone.0034004-Cheyette1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Bioinformatic analyses have revealed that <italic>DACT1</italic> mRNA is expressed in the amnion, fetal brain, eye, heart, adult brain medulla, gastric cancer (signet ring cell features), RER+ colon tumor, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, germ cell tumor, chondrosarcoma, and parathyroid tumors <xref rid="pone.0034004-Katoh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, based on the evolutionary and functional conservation of Wnt signaling molecules, as well as the human chromosomal localization of DACT1, the <italic>DACT1</italic> gene is also predicted to be a potent cancer-associated gene <xref rid="pone.0034004-Katoh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. <italic>DACT1</italic> has been reported to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yau1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A recent report identified a correlation between <italic>DACT1</italic> expression in lung cancer and poor histological grade, large tumor size, extent of tumor invasion, and lymph node metastasis <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although some studies have shown associations between <italic>DACT1</italic> expression and cancer, the function of <italic>DACT1</italic> in the WNT/Î²-catenin signaling pathway remains unclear. One possible mechanism is that Dpr stabilizes GSK-3Î² and axin in the APC complex, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation studies <xref rid="pone.0034004-Cheyette1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Another possibility is that Dpr competes with Fz for binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl, thereby blocking the signal transduction via Dvl, and hence inhibits the Dvl-mediated stabilization of Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0034004-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Yau et al. reported that human Dpr1 was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and this downregulation was correlated with the cytoplasmic accumulation of Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yau1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, in this report, we have found that <italic>DACT1</italic> is overexpressed in colon cancer, and it acts to enhance cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in colon cancer cell lines. We have shown that <italic>DACT1</italic> interacts with GSK-3Î² and Î²-catenin. We have further demonstrated that <italic>DACT1</italic> stabilizes Î²-catenin via <italic>DACT1</italic>-induced effects on GSK-3Î² and directly interacts with Î²-catenin. We have also demonstrated <italic>DACT1</italic> inhibits the activity of GSK-3Î² via increasing the level of phosphorylated GSK-3Î² at Ser9, which alters the subcellular location of Î²-catenin. It particularly promotes Î²-catenin levels at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus.</p>

<italic>DACT1</italic> is overexpressed in human colon carcinoma</title>
        <p>To identify the potential roles of <italic>DACT1</italic> in the development and progression of colonic carcinoma, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess the level of gene expression. We compared the expression in six cancer tissues to those in six paired samples of normal control colonic mucosa. The results showed that the level of <italic>DACT1</italic> mRNA was significantly elevated in all six samples of colon cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The gene expression data were further confirmed by Western blotting, which were performed with the use of soluble cell lysates prepared from surgical colectomy specimens. The results confirmed that high levels of <italic>DACT1</italic> protein are present in colon cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To understand the function of <italic>DACT1</italic> in colon cancer, we explored the effect of ectopic <italic>DACT1</italic> expression on cellular growth in vitro in cell lines with different levels of endogenous <italic>DACT1</italic> expression. Following transfection with a <italic>DACT1</italic> cDNA expression construct, SW480 colon cancer cells, which express very low endogenous levels of <italic>DACT1</italic>, demonstrated a significant increase in cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, cellular proliferation decreased when endogenous <italic>DACT1</italic> expression was silenced by stable transfection with siRNA vectors that targeted <italic>DACT1</italic> in the HCT116, LoVo and HT29 colon cancer cell lines, which have much higher endogenous levels of <italic>DACT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g002">Figure 2BâD</xref>). To confirm these results, endogenous <italic>DACT1</italic> expression was silenced by stable transfection with another siRNA vectors (<italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA1) that targeted distinct regions of <italic>DACT1</italic> in the HCT116 cells and the same results were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034004.s001">Figure S1AâB</xref>).</p>

        <p>To examine the effects of the silencing of <italic>DACT1</italic> on colon tumor growth in vivo, HCT116 cells that stably expressed a control siRNA or <italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA were used. Cells (5Ã10<sup>6</sup>) were injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the nude mouse (nâ=â8 animals per group). Tumors were measured weekly with a vernier caliper, and their volumes were calculated according to the following formula: Ï/6ÃlengthÃwidth<sup>2</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0034004-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. All of the animals injected with HCT116 cells that expressed control siRNA developed tumors by 14 days after injection, while only 75% (6/8) of the <italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA animals developed tumors. Fifty-six days after injection, the tumors of the control siRNA animals were significantly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The mean tumor volume was 2,068.78Â±561.57 mm<sup>3</sup> in mice injected with HCT116 cells that expressed control siRNA, compared to the mean tumor volume in mice injected with HCT116 cells that expressed <italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA (503.46Â±178.90 mm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

<italic>DACT1</italic> enhances the migration and lack of anchorage of colon cancer cells</title>
        <p>Anchorage-independent proliferation is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation and is regarded to be conducive to the proliferation of cancer cells away from their original site. With this knowledge, we examined the capacity of <italic>DACT1</italic> to drive the anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells by soft agar colony formation assays. The overexpression of <italic>DACT1</italic> enhanced the anchorage-independent proliferation of SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>The most dangerous feature of malignancy is the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells.

Fifty-six days later, the tumors of six out of eight control siRNA-transfected nude mice had invaded into the musculature, while only two of the tumors in <italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA-transfected animals had invaded into the musculature.

        <p>Considering that cyclin D1 and c-Myc are related to cell cycle regulation, we examined the effect of <italic>DACT1</italic> overexpression and silencing on cell cycle regulation in colon cancer cells. In these experiments, all of the cells were synchronized at the G0/G1 phases by serum starvation. Cell cycle profiling by FACS indicated that the overexpression of <italic>DACT1</italic> in SW480 cells was associated with an increase in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

These results suggest that the S+G2/M accumulation of cells after <italic>DACT1</italic> silencing is specifically associated with the loss of <italic>DACT1</italic> protein. Collectively, these results indicate that <italic>DACT1</italic> promotes the proliferation of colon cancer cells by facilitating the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle.</p>
        <p>Besides cyclin D1, CDK4 is another key factor that facilitates the G1/S transition.

Then, the relative abundance of Î²-catenin in these fractions was analyzed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g006">Figure 6E and F</xref>).

<italic>DACT1</italic> interacts with Î²-catenin and the components of the Î²-catenin destruction complex to stabilize Î²-catenin</title>
        <p>We were interested in clarifying the mechanism by which elevated levels of <italic>DACT1</italic> resulted in increased Î²-catenin expression. In the absence of Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic levels of Î²-catenin are regulated by the destruction complex that contains axin, APC, and glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²), where Î²-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3Î² at multiple serine and threonine residues in its N terminus. Phosphorylated Î²-catenin is then ubiquitinated, leading to its rapid proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0034004-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Aberle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Marikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Salomon1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yanagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To determine whether <italic>DACT1</italic> increases Î²-catenin levels by influencing Î²-catenin stability, HCT116 cells (with or without <italic>DACT1</italic> silencing) were incubated with 10 Âµg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent new Î²-catenin synthesis. Then, Î²-catenin levels were measured by Western blotting to reflect the rate of Î²-catenin protein degradation. Silencing of <italic>DACT1</italic> expression significantly increased the Î²-catenin degradation rate, resulting in an evident reduction in the levels of remaining Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

        <title>Increased expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> has oncogenic functions in colon cancer</title>
        <p>Our studies have shown that <italic>DACT1</italic> is overexpressed in human colonic adenocarcinomas. This result is consistent with previous observation that <italic>DACT1</italic> was upregulated in invasive breast tumors <xref rid="pone.0034004-Schuetz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our studies have also revealed that Î²-catenin and Dvl-2 are upregulated along with <italic>DACT1</italic>, and demonstrate that there is a trend toward poor survival in patients with tumors that have higher scores for <italic>DACT1</italic> expression in colon adenocarcinomas <xref rid="pone.0034004-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These results suggest that the higher expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> may have oncogenic functions in colon cancer. However, <italic>DACT1</italic> has also been reported to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yau1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which suggests that the function of <italic>DACT1</italic> may be dependent on cellular context. Here, our observations show that the expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> enhances cellular proliferation and promotes tumor growth and metastasis in the SW480, HCT116, LoVo and HT29 cell lines with or without APC or Î²-catenin mutations.</p>

<italic>DACT1</italic> upregulates Î²-catenin levels in colon cancer cells</title>
        <p>Xenopus Dpr, the ortholog of <italic>DACT1</italic>, was found to be a negative regulator in both Dvl-mediated canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathway by Cheyette et al. in 2002 <xref rid="pone.0034004-Cheyette1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Concurrently, Gloy et al. demonstrated that Fordo, another ortholog of <italic>DACT1</italic> promotes Wnt signaling in axis formation and in eye and neural development in Xenopus embryos <xref rid="pone.0034004-Gloy1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. To date, the function of DACT proteins in the regulation of signaling pathways remains ambiguous, but it is very clear that <italic>DACT1</italic> not only regulates embryonic development but may have an important role in tumorigenesis. Indeed, one study demonstrated that <italic>DACT1</italic> was downregulated in hepatocarcinoma, and this downregulation was associated with the methylation of its promoter-associated CpG island and significantly correlated with the cytoplasmic accumulation of Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yau1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, Jiang et al. reported that the expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> did not differ significantly between human colorectal tumors and control tissues, and the <italic>DACT1</italic> promoter was partially methylated <xref rid="pone.0034004-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. <italic>DACT1</italic> expression in lung cancer was downregulated <xref rid="pone.0034004-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We found that <italic>DACT1</italic> upregulated Î²-catenin in colon cancer cell lines. The higher expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> not only increased the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of Î²-catenin, but also increased its membrane-associated fraction. In mammals, Î²-catenin is originally identified as a component associated with cadherins, which are Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules <xref rid="pone.0034004-Hulsken1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Besides its function in the cadherin complex, Î²-catenin has an essential role in the Wnt signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0034004-Cadigan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our results showed that the E-cadherin expression pattern in colon cancer cells was unaltered by <italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA or <italic>DACT1</italic> overexpression. These results suggest that <italic>DACT1</italic> affects the level of Î²-catenin through the Wnt signaling pathway. Cyclin D1 and c-Myc are Wnt target genes. They can regulate the cell cycle and promote cell proliferation. We found that increased level of <italic>DACT1</italic> not only led to higher levels of total Î²-catenin and activated Î²-catenin, but increased the expression of the Î²-catenin/TCF target genes, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Further studies showed that <italic>DACT1</italic> promoted the proliferation of colon cancer cells by facilitating their transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The overexpression of <italic>DACT1</italic> in the SW480 cell line resulted in an increase in the population of cells in the G0/G1 phases. While the expression of <italic>DACT1</italic> in cells with a <italic>DACT1</italic> knockdown resulted in an increase in the population of cells in the S+G2/M phases. Those results are consistent with the results that <italic>DACT1</italic> enhances cellular proliferation in vitro and colon tumorigenesis in vivo.</p>

        <title>The mechanisms of <italic>DACT1</italic>-induced upregulation of Î²-catenin in colon cancer cells</title>
        <p>The stability of Î²-catenin is known to be properly regulated by the multiprotein complex containing axin, GSK-3Î², and APC. In the absence of an activating Wnt signal, mediated via Wnt binding to the Frizzled/LRP5/6 coreceptor complex, cytoplasmic Î²-catenin is destabilized by the multiprotein complex. Axin acts as the scaffold of this complex and interacts with the other components, Î²-catenin, APC, and GSK-3Î². The interaction of GSK-3Î² with axin in the complex facilitates efficient phosphorylation of Î²-catenin by GSK-3Î². Phosphorylated Î²-catenin is then ubiquitinated, leading to its rapid proteasomal degradation. We found that <italic>DACT1</italic> binds to axin and GSK-3Î² in colon cancer cells. The results support the fact that <italic>DACT1</italic> interacts with the destruction complex to prevent the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of Î²-catenin. We also found that <italic>DACT1</italic> interacted with Î²-catenin in the plasma membrane, which indicated that <italic>DACT1</italic> may directly regulate the degradation of Î²-catenin, leading to the accumulation of cytoplasmic Î²-catenin. However, the mechanisms by which <italic>DACT1</italic> regulates this multiprotein complex and Î²-catenin are unclear.</p>
        <p>
<italic>DACT1</italic> has been identified as an interacting protein for Dvl and induces Dvl degradation via a lysosome inhibitor-sensitive and proteasome inhibitor-insensitive mechanism <xref rid="pone.0034004-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Dvl is a central mediator of Wnt signaling. It is activated by the binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled/low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) coreceptor at the cell surface. Activated Dvl binds to the axin/GSK-3Î² complex and inhibits the GSK-3Î²-induced degradation of Î²-catenin, therefore activating the expression of target genes via the Î²-catenin-T-cell factor-lymphoid enhancer factor complex <xref rid="pone.0034004-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Moon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our data showed that <italic>DACT1</italic> could downregulate the expression of Dvl-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034004.s004">Figure S4</xref>), whereas the expression of Dvl-1 and Dvl-3 was not been affected by <italic>DACT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034004.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The results suggest that <italic>DACT1</italic> upregulates Î²-catenin level in colon cancer cells through direct regulation of the multiprotein complex and Î²-catenin.

<italic>DACT1</italic> mediated the subcellular localization of Î²-catenin</title>
        <p>Î²-catenin can be found in three cell compartments: the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The soluble cytoplasmic pool of Î²-catenin is highly unstable; when it is stabilized by the Wnt signal, this results in nuclear localization. Nuclear Î²-catenin is a cofactor for a wide variety of transcription factors that regulate the expression of many genes involved in cell growth. At the membrane, Î²-catenin plays a pivotal role in cell-cell adhesion, linking the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin to Î±-catenin. The deregulation of Î²-catenin or E-cadherin leads to the loss of cell-cell adhesion <xref rid="pone.0034004-Brembeck1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We found that increased levels of <italic>DACT1</italic> led to higher levels of membrane-associated Î²-catenin, but the E-cadherin expression pattern in colon cancer cells was unaltered by <italic>DACT1</italic> siRNA or the overexpression of <italic>DACT1</italic>. We also found <italic>DACT1</italic> enhanced anchorage independence, as well as the migratory and invasive potential of colon cancer cell lines. These results are consistent with the above theories. In addition, our data showed that the <italic>DACT1</italic> expression level and membrane-associated Î²-catenin expression level were positively correlated in colon cancer cell lines and primary colon cancers. These results are consistent with our previous report that showed Î²-catenin was upregulated and is associated with <italic>DACT1</italic> levels. This demonstrates that there is a trend toward poor survival in patients with tumors that have higher scores for <italic>DACT1</italic> expression in colon adenocarcinomas <xref rid="pone.0034004-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Mechanisms by which <italic>DACT1</italic> mediates the subcellular localization of Î²-catenin</title>

Previous studies have shown that the inhibition of GSK-3Î² promoted the accumulation of Î²-catenin in the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0034004-EtienneManneville1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and at the plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0034004-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034004-Staal1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which our data confirmed.

We further found that <italic>DACT1</italic> interacted with GSK-3Î². This result supports the finding that <italic>DACT1</italic> regulates the subcellular location of Î²-catenin through inhibiting the activity of GSK-3Î².

        <title>The model for the mechanism by which <italic>DACT1</italic> promotes the oncogenesis of colon cancer cells</title>
        <p>The data in the present study support the following model for the mechanism by which <italic>DACT1</italic> promotes the oncogenesis of colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034004-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In unstimulated, normal colon cells that lack <italic>DACT1</italic>, GSK-3Î² is present in the cytoplasm and forms the Î²-catenin destruction complex with axin and APC. This allows the destruction complex to phosphorylate Î²-catenin and target it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In colon cancer cells that express high levels of <italic>DACT1</italic>, we propose that <italic>DACT1</italic> interacts with Î²-catenin, after which <italic>DACT1</italic> binds to and inhibits GSK-3Î², which results in the release of Î²-catenin from the destruction complex, increased intracellular Î²-catenin levels, and its subsequent accumulation in the nucleus. This would lead to the activation of downstream Î²-catenin/TCF-regulated target genes, and at the membrane, regulation of the adhesion or migration properties of the cell. These studies define a functional role of <italic>DACT1</italic> in human tumorigenesis and, besides highlighting <italic>DACT1</italic> as a potential therapeutic target in colon cancer, define a mechanism for the regulation of Î²-catenin in cancer.</p>

The sections and cells were then fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% Triton-100. The sections and cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 h in TBS containing 5% BSA. Sections and cells were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with a Î²-catenin antibody (1â¶200 dilution), E-cadherin antibody (1â¶200 dilution), or phospho-GSK-3Î²(Ser9) (1â¶100; Cell Signaling Technology), active Î²-catenin antibody (1â¶200 dilution; Millipore). For the double-immunolabelling experiments, the primary antibodies against GFP (anti-mouse; 1â¶50), Î²-catenin antibody (anti-rabbit; 1â¶200); axin1 antibody (anti-rabbit; 1â¶200), GSK-3Î² (anti-rabbit; 1â¶200) and <italic>DACT1</italic> antibody (anti-rabbit; 1â¶200), Î²-catenin antibody (anti-mouse; 1â¶200) or GSK-3Î² (anti-mouse; 1â¶200; Santa Cruz) were incubated simultaneously overnight at 4Â°C. Sections and cells grown on the confocal dish were rinsed at least three times for 5 min in PBS, and were then simultaneously incubated with the secondary antibody fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson, West Grove, PA, USA), or Dyelight594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) at a 1â¶1,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Sections and cells were then counterstained with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was visualized using a laser confocal scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta).</p>

After 12,000 g centrifugation for 15 min, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) for 3 h at 4Â°C. Thereafter, the precipitants were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). The immune complexes were then eluted with sample buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min at 95Â°C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p>
