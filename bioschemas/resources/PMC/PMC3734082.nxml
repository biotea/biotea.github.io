        <p>Aurora A phosphorylation-induced interaction of TACC3 and clathrin coordinates adjacent domains in each protein to create a microtubule-binding interface, whereas a distinct site in TACC3 recruits ch-TOG to mitotic spindles.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Acomplex of transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), colonic and hepatic tumor overexpressed gene (ch-TOG), and clathrin has been implicated in mitotic spindle assembly and in the stabilization of kinetochore fibers by cross-linking microtubules. It is unclear how this complex binds microtubules and how the proteins in the complex interact with one another. TACC3 and clathrin have each been proposed to be the spindle recruitment factor. We have mapped the interactions within the complex and show that TACC3 and clathrin were interdependent for spindle recruitment, having to interact in order for either to be recruited to the spindle. The N-terminal domain of clathrin and the TACC domain of TACC3 in tandem made a microtubule interaction surface, coordinated by TACC3âclathrin binding. A dileucine motif and Aurora Aâphosphorylated serine 558 on TACC3 bound to the âankleâ of clathrin. The other interaction within the complex involved a stutter in the TACC3 coiled-coil and a proposed novel sixth TOG domain in ch-TOG, which was required for microtubule localization of ch-TOG but not TACC3âclathrin.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The spindle apparatus is a dynamic array of microtubules (MTs) that is responsible for the alignment and segregation of duplicated chromosomes during mitosis. Numerous MT-binding proteins, including motor and nonmotor proteins, control spindle assembly and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manning and Compton, 2008</xref>). Many of these proteins are under the control of mitotic kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr and Gergely, 2007</xref>). One such complex of nonmotor proteins consists of transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), colonic and hepatic tumor overexpressed gene (ch-TOG), and clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin is important for stabilizing MTs in the kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle by forming inter-MT bridges that cross-link adjacent MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, this complex may also stabilize the MTs via the MT polymerization activity of ch-TOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charrasse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>). TACC3 is a substrate of Aurora A and this activity is crucial for TACC3âclathrin interactions and spindle localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeRoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheeseman et al., 2011</xref>). Understanding how the members of the complex bind one another and how the complex interacts with MTs could facilitate the design of targeted inhibitors to disrupt the function of the complex. Such inhibitors could have potential clinical implications because Aurora A, TACC3, and ch-TOG are dysregulated in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charrasse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr and Gergely, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peset and Vernos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al., 2012</xref>) and TACC3 in particular is an attractive target for chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>TACC3, ch-TOG, and clathrin are all found at the mitotic spindle, although the patterns of distribution differ slightly: ch-TOG is more pronounced at centrosomes, whereas TACC3 is highly enriched on spindle MTs, and clathrin is found on spindle MTs but also in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gergely et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Royle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foraker et al., 2012</xref>). Ch-TOG is important for spindle assembly and MT stabilization during mitosis, whereas clathrin and TACC3 are important for MT stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cassimeris and Morabito, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Royle et al., 2005</xref>). Ch-TOG has distinct mitotic functions at centrosomes and MTs, whereas in human cells TACC3 and clathrin appear to function primarily at spindle MTs as part of the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmfeldt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr and Gergely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cassimeris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). In some other species there are also critical functions for TACC proteins at centrosomes, which could perhaps be fulfilled by TACC1 and TACC2 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gergely et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peset et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Both TACC3 and clathrin are needed for MT localization of ch-TOG, likely mediated by a predicted direct interaction between ch-TOG and the conserved coiled-coil TACC domain at the C-terminal end of TACC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conte et al., 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, TACC3 and clathrin were each reported to be essential for recruitment of the other to the spindle in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). TACC3 and clathrin interact directly once TACC3 is phosphorylated at serine 558 (S558) by Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). This phosphorylated motif is thought to contact the âankleâ of the clathrin heavy chain (CHC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). TACC3 phosphorylation is known to be essential for TACC3 recruitment to the spindle, and experiments involving Aurora A inhibition indicated that TACC3 phosphorylation also regulates clathrin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeRoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). This implies that phosphorylation influences localization via regulation of interaction with clathrin. Despite the need for TACC3 and clathrin for complex localization, neither protein interacts with MTs in vitro, suggesting that spindle recruitment of the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin complex may be more complicated than serial recruitment and anchoring via a single MT-binding subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Royle, 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, additional regions apart from the CHC ankle and TACC3 pS558 contribute to mitotic localization in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gergely et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Royle et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, it is unclear (a) how TACC3, ch-TOG, and clathrin interact with one another, (b) which members of the complex interact with MTs, and (c) how this is regulated by Aurora A. To answer these questions, we began by defining the regions of TACC3 and clathrin that are required for spindle recruitment. We identify a novel mode of MT binding in which domains in TACC3 and clathrin create a composite binding interface when coordinated in tandem. This coordination is regulated by Aurora A phosphorylation of TACC3, which triggers interaction of TACC3 with clathrin via regions of each protein that are distinct from their MT interaction surface. We also map the TACC3âch-TOG interaction, propose an additional TOG domain, and show that ch-TOG is dispensable for MT localization of TACC3âclathrin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Two separate regions of TACC3 are required for spindle binding</title><p>To investigate which regions of TACC3 are required for spindle binding, we examined the localization of GFP-tagged TACC3 truncation proteins in cells. These RNAi-resistant proteins were expressed in TACC3-depleted cells together with mCherry-tagged clathrin light chain a (mCherry-LCa) to visualize clathrin. Removal of the TACC domain (GFP-TACC3[1â593]) prevented spindle binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), confirming the importance of the TACC domain for TACC3 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peset et al., 2005</xref>). However, other regions of TACC3 were also required, as the TACC domain alone (GFP-TACC3[594â838]) was only weakly recruited. GFP-TACC3(500â838) was recruited as efficiently as full-length TACC3, indicating that this fragment contains all necessary residues for spindle binding and that residues 1â499 are not required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This fragment contains the region aa 522â577, which was shown previously to bind CHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Like the TACC domain, this clathrin interaction domain (CID) was necessary but not sufficient for spindle binding as GFP-TACC3(522â577) was not localized to the spindle. A truncation that disrupted the CID also prevented recruitment (GFP-TACC3[560â838]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Spindle localization of clathrin matched that of TACC3 constructs, highlighting the interdependence of spindle recruitment of these two proteins. In summary, the first 499 residues are dispensable for localization of TACC3, but the TACC domain and CID are each necessary but not sufficient for spindle binding.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Two regions in TACC3 are needed for spindle recruitment: the TACC domain and the CID comprising a dileucine motif and pS558.</bold> (A) Representative confocal micrographs of GFP-TACC3 constructs (green) coexpressed in TACC3-depleted HeLa cells with mCherry-LCa (red) and DNA (blue).

We targeted conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and included S558A, which has reduced spindle localization, as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). Several TACC3 mutants had reduced recruitment relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The most striking was mutation of a dileucine motif (LL[566,567]AA), which strongly disrupted localization of TACC3, similar to S558A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Mutation of residues immediately upstream of this dileucine motif (FDP[563â565]AAA) also perturbed TACC3 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We also noted a subtle change in localization with mutation of YLE(540â542)AAA. S552 in addition to S558 is a known substrate of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>), yet mutation S552A had little effect on localization. Again, the spindle localization of clathrin matched that of TACC3 in all cases. These results show that the CID of TACC3 contains a novel dileucine motif (L566,567) close to S558. Because the CID is known to interact with CHC in an Aurora Aâdependent manner it seemed likely that these residues form part of the interface with CHC.</p></sec><sec><title>The TACC3 dileucine motif functions independently of phosphorylation</title><p>To determine the relative contributions to spindle localization of TACC3 by S558 and the dileucine motif within the CID, we again coexpressed TACC3 mutants with mCherry-LCa. MLN8237 (0.3 ÂµM) was used to inhibit Aurora A activity as a reference for minimal recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). LL(566,567)AA was poorly recruited, with lower enrichment at spindles than S558A, underlining the importance of the dileucine motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The phosphomimetic S558D showed good spindle recruitment, albeit less than wild type. Inhibition of Aurora A completely disrupted spindle localization for all TACC3 constructs including S558 mutants. This argues that phosphorylation of another site on TACC3 by Aurora A occurs, at least when S558 is mutated, and has a minor role in localization. Again, spindle localization of clathrin always mirrored that of TACC3.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The dileucine motif in CID mediates TACC3 recruitment independently of S558 phosphorylation.</bold> (A) Quantification of spindle recruitment of GFP-TACC3 mutants and mCherry-LCa, coexpressed in TACC3-depleted HEK293 cells.

To begin to address this question in cells, we used a method for inducible rerouting of expressed proteins to mitochondria (knocksideways [KS]) to examine interactions between clathrin and TACC3 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>). In this approach, a GFP-TACC3 construct with an FKBP tag is coexpressed with a mitochondrially targeted protein containing an FRB tag (MitoTrap) in TACC3-depleted cells. Addition of rapamycin induces heterodimerization of the FKBP and FRB, meaning that FKBP-tagged proteins become stably rerouted and trapped at the mitochondria. In this way, we can test in cells whether or not TACC3 constructs and clathrin interact, as the corerouting of clathrin with TACC3 indicates a tight interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>When MLN8237 treatment was performed before TACC3 KS, there was a reduction in CHC corecruitment compared with controls. Interestingly, treatment with MLN8237 after TACC3 KS also reduced clathrin enrichment at mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), suggesting that Aurora A activity is not completely restricted to the spindle poles. These results indicate that phosphorylation is required to maintain the TACC3âclathrin interaction in cells. Furthermore, corecruitment of endogenous clathrin to mitochondria upon KS was defective with both LL(566,567)AA and S558A TACC3 mutants compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This supports the idea that spindle recruitment of these mutants is defective because of reduced interaction with clathrin in cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The dileucine motif and pS558 in the CID of TACC3 are important for interaction with CHC.</bold> (A and B) KS experiments.

Our first attempts at clACC cosedimentation with MTs were unsuccessful because of the instability of recombinant clACC protein. Instead, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize binding of proteins to MTs. YFP-CHC(1â574) and mCherry-TACC3(519â838) were incubated together with Aurora A and ATP to form a subcomplex. Adding this mixture to preformed MTs caused single MTs to bundle together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). This bundling was not seen when either Aurora A or ATP were excluded from the mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>).

Quantification of YFP-CHC(1â574) fluorescence at bundles versus single MTs showed a twofold preference for binding MT bundles and ruled out the possibility that the binding observed was a function of the MT density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). These observations support the idea that (a) clathrin and TACC3 cannot individually bind MTs, (b) they must be phosphorylated by Aurora A to bind, and (c) together they form a composite surface for direct interaction with MTs.

We assessed whether the deletions had disrupted folding of the protein by CD spectroscopy and found two mutants (Î678â681 and Î682â688) had normal structure, whereas one (Î672â678) was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211127/DC1" id="supp8">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Using this information, we generated the same deletions in full-length GFP-TACC3 and expressed them in TACC3-depleted cells to examine the localization of the mutants together with clathrin and ch-TOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 E</xref>). Neither deletion affected the spindle localization of TACC3 or clathrin. We found that the amount of ch-TOG on the spindle MTs was reduced compared with wild type, but was not as low as depletion of TACC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 E</xref>). Note that centrosomal recruitment of ch-TOG was unaffected. We also generated the same deletions in GFP-clACC and found that localization to spindle MTs was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 F</xref>). Interestingly, wild-type clACC often localized to centrosomes similarly to ch-TOG and this was disrupted by either deletion. This observation argues that both deletions disrupt TACCâch-TOG interactions in cells. Moreover, this centrosomal enrichment of clACC, which is not seen with full-length or endogenous TACC3, must be caused by deregulated binding of ch-TOG. These results argue that the interaction between TACC3 and ch-TOG is not required for spindle localization of TACC3 and clathrin.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>The interaction between TACC3 and ch-TOG is not required for MT localization of TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin.</bold> (A) Schematic diagram of TACC3 TACC domain truncation proteins and their stability.

If this were the case, the interaction would involve a CBM in ch-TOG binding to the NTD of CHC between blades 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Four CBM sequences are present in ch-TOG, but the first three are folded in the TOG1 domain and would not be available for binding CHC as linear motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 G [i]</xref>). The other, LFQIE, was found in the C-terminal region of ch-TOG. However, a ch-TOG mutant of this motif (AAQAK) and clathrin were both found on the mitotic spindle, arguing against a possible interaction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211127/DC1" id="supp10">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>).</p><p>We next investigated the structure of the TACC3-binding region of ch-TOG. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we probed the structure of a C-terminal fragment of the ch-TOG <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homologue minispindles (Msps). Msps was chosen in preference to ch-TOG for technical reasons, because the recombinant protein was smaller in size and more stable, allowing assignment of 85% of the backbone resonances. Measurement of the dynamics of this region revealed three subregions, which had properties consistent with two independently mobile folded domains connected by a flexible linker. The larger and more conserved of the two-folded domains in Msps C-terminal fragment has 12 Î± helices, consistent with the arrangement of a TOG domain, as is the equivalent region in ch-TOG (Fig. S5, B and C). This domain encompasses the LFQIE motif described above, such that this CBM is also folded in an Î± helix and unavailable for binding. The four motifs within ch-TOG that resemble CBMs were all found in structurally related positions, at the C-terminal end of the B helices in HEAT repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 G [ii]</xref>), indicating that these two very different functional motifs have similar sequence preferences.</p><p>To provide experimental validation of the TOG6 domain in Msps, we measured residual dipolar couplings (RDCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tjandra and Bax, 1997</xref>) for Msps TOG6. RDCs arise from aligning a protein in a liquid crystal and are dependent on the orientation of NH bond vectors relative to the alignment axis. The resulting values allow a robust evaluation of protein folds based on the relative orientation of secondary structure elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2000</xref>). We compared the experimental RDCs of Msps TOG6 domain to values calculated for homology models of Msps TOG6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zweckstetter, 2008</xref>) based on the crystal structures of two different TOG domains that, although highly similar, vary in the precise orientations of Î± helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H</xref>): TOG2 from Stu2p (PDB accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2QK1">2QK1</ext-link>) and TOG3 from Zyg9 (PDB accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2OF3">2OF3</ext-link>). We focused on the Î±-helical residues that would be expected to show similar orientations between different TOG domains, whereas the loops would be expected to be highly variable. Overall, the orientations of the backbone residues in Msps were a good fit to the Stu2p TOG2 model, and fitted Zyg9 TOG3 less well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H [ii]</xref>). We classified the Î± helices of Msps TOG6 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H [iii]</xref>): seven helices that best fit Stu2p TOG2 (blue), three helices that best fit Zyg9 TOG3 (red), and two helices of HR6 that were a poor fit to either model (green). The orientation of HR6 relative to the other repeats varies between TOG domains, as illustrated by Stu2p TOG2 and Zyg9 TOG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H [i]</xref>), and it is not surprising that HR6 of Msps does not align with the equivalent regions of other TOG models. Thus, the number and orientations of the Î± helices of Msps (1591â1850) are consistent with the presence of a sixth TOG domain in ch-TOG homologues.</p><p>To make an initial comparison of the Msps TOG6 domain with TOG domains of known structure, their primary sequences were aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 H [iii]</xref>). Although the overall pairwise identities of the three sequences are low (&lt;20%), there are regions of sequence conservation within and between several of the HEAT repeats. The prominent divergent features are HR6 of all three proteins, which is poorly conserved in structure and sequence, and the extended loop region between the A and B helices of HR5 of Msps TOG6.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified a novel mode of MT binding in which domains in two separate proteins create a composite binding interface when coordinated in tandem. This coordination is regulated by Aurora A phosphorylation. Our results explain the previously observed interdependence of recruitment of TACC3 and clathrin to the mitotic spindle, where neither TACC3 nor CHC associate efficiently with the spindle without the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Royle, 2012</xref>). Finally, we mapped the TACC3âch-TOG interaction, proposed a new sixth TOG domain, and showed that ch-TOG is dispensable for MT localization of TACC3âclathrin. The interactions and a new scheme for TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin recruitment to spindle MTs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram to summarize our findings.</bold> TACC3 and clathrin interact via the CID and ankle regions, respectively (green). This is regulated by Aurora A phosphorylation of CID at S558. This interaction coordinates the NTD (Î²-propeller) and TACC domain (coiled-coil) in tandem to make a composite MT interaction surface (yellow-red). TACC3 binds ch-TOG via a break in the coiled-coil of TACC3 and Î± region of ch-TOG containing TOG6 and 4Î± domains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201211127R_Fig10"/></fig><p>Clathrin and TACC3 interact directly when TACC3 S558 is phosphorylated by Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Previous work narrowed down this interaction to residues 522â577 of TACC3 and residues 331â542 of CHC, with phosphorylation of S558 by Aurora A being important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). It was unclear whether other residues within TACC3(522â577) contributed to binding, but the data presented here demonstrate that several residues between aa 540 and 567 are required for this interaction and resultant spindle recruitment in cells. Our model of CHCR0 and experimental tests of this model indicate that the dileucine motif on TACC3 binds at a hydrophobic pocket bordered by the loop between helices <italic>f</italic> and <italic>g</italic> of CHCR0, with pS558 of TACC3 being coordinated by positive charge on the âsideâ surface of CHCR0. The TACC3 residues involved are conserved from mammals to flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), consistent with a conserved mitotic function for the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2010</xref>). The CHC ankle-binding site for TACC3 is distinct from that for the Î²2 subunit of the AP-2 complex, meaning that mitosis-specific clathrin inhibitors could be developed without necessarily disrupting endocytosis.</p><p>We showed that coordination of clathrin NTD and TACC domains in tandem is sufficient for MT association, via a synthetic clACC fusion protein. The organization of a Î²-propeller/WD40 domain in tandem with a coiled-coil domain is found in other proteins, e.g., coronin, Nedd1, and POCs, that bind MTs and/or centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goode et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woodland and Fry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). This pairing of domains could therefore represent a general MT interaction surface. An alternative interpretation is that TACC3âclathrin interaction results in two individually weak MT-binding surfaces that can bind to MTs via increased avidity, but are not necessarily coordinated in space. It is difficult to formally exclude this possibility, but we favor the interpretation of tandem domain coordination. Clathrin triskelia have three NTDs (putative weak MT interaction domains) per molecule and yet cannot interact with MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). Coordination of one NTD with one TACC domain within clACC permits MT binding and this binding is lost upon C+ mutation of the NTD. The most parsimonious conclusion here is that a mix and match of two different domains is required and this argues against a simple mechanism based on increased avidity. A structural explanation for precisely how the NTD and TACC domain bind MTs is an important question for the future.</p><p>At centrosomes, ch-TOG is critical for MT assembly and maintenance of MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmfeldt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr and Gergely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Luca et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cassimeris et al., 2009</xref>). This activity is seemingly independent of TACC3âclathrin in human cells. The role of ch-TOG in the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin complex remains enigmatic. It is curious that ch-TOG requires TACC3âclathrin for interaction with spindle MTs because TOG domains have a conserved interaction with tubulin. In addition, a MT lattice-binding motif, identified in XMAP215, is also partially conserved in ch-TOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spittle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">OâBrien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>). Homologues of ch-TOG and TACC3 are known to bind in lower species but so far, in humans, only a direct interaction between ch-TOG and TACC1 had been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conte et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peset and Vernos, 2008</xref>). We mapped the direct interaction between human ch-TOG and TACC3 to a specific break in the coiled-coil of TACC3 and the C-terminal region of ch-TOG. This interaction is required for ch-TOG spindle recruitment, but is not required for assembly of the TACC3âclathrin complex on spindle MTs. Our analysis identified new structural features of the XMAP215 family of MT polymerases: the conserved C-terminal region of ch-TOG has a potential novel TOG6 domain. Future work will characterize the structure and MT-binding properties of this domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and inhibitors</title><p>Primary antibodies were: (1) mouse monoclonals TACC3, Î±-tubulin DM1A (Abcam), CHC TD.1, X22 (produced in-house), Aurora A 4/IAK (BD), and MBP 8G1 (2396; Cell Signaling Technology); (2) rabbit polyclonals TACC3 H300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Î²-tubulin, pericentrin (Abcam), and pS558 TACC3 (raised in-house).

The expression protein was captured on a 1-ml StrepTrap column (GE Healthcare), which was then washed with TBS and eluted with 3 mM Desthiobiotin.</p><p>Stable isotope-labeled Msps(1591â1941) protein was produced by CodonPlus RIL <italic>E.coli</italic> cells transformed with plasmid. Cells were grown in deuterated M9 media supplemented with <sup>15</sup>N ammonium chloride, <sup>13</sup>C <sc>d</sc>-glucose (Goss Scientific Instruments Ltd), kanamycin, and chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37Â°C until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.25 was reached. Recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.6 mM IPTG and overnight incubation at 21Â°C. Stable isotope-labeled Msps(1591â1850) was generated as for Msps(1591â1941) using <italic>E.coli</italic> OD2 N media (Silantes) with induction at an OD<sub>600</sub> of â¼0.6. Tagged Msps protein was purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare) as per the manufacturerâs instructions. The His-NusA tag was removed by overnight TEV cleavage. The resulting protein was passed through a further Q-Sepharose column to remove the TEV protease and His-NusA tag. Msps-containing fractions were concentrated before size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep Sephacryl-S300 HR column (GE Healthcare) into 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.02% sodium azide. Purified Msps was concentrated to â¼400 ÂµM for NMR analysis.</p><p>For in vitro binding assays, 50 Âµg of GST-tagged protein was incubated with 2 Âµg/ml Aurora A kinase (EMD Millipore) or BSA, 2 Âµg/ml GST-TPX2(1â43), and 10 mM MgATP for 2 h at 30Â°C in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EGTA). For CHC mutant-binding experiments, TACC3 was phosphorylated before incubation with MBP-CHC mutants. Phosphorylated GST protein was incubated with 30 Âµl glutathione sepharose 4B in a total volume of 200 Âµl NET-2 buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% NP-40 substitute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>]) containing 0.1 mg/ml of clathrin or clathrin mutants. Proteins were incubated overnight with rotation at 4Â°C, and then spun at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min. Supernatant was retained and beads were washed four times with 1 ml NET-2. 30 Âµl of 2Ã Laemmli buffer was added to the beads; they were denatured at 100Â°C for 5 min and half was analyzed by Western blotting along with 5 Âµl of the supernatant.</p><p>In vitro binding assays between purified His-NusA TACC3 proteins and ch-TOG 1517â1957 were performed at 4Â°C. 100 Âµg His-NusA TACC3 was incubated with 20 Âµl of Nickel Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) for 2 h with rotation in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20). Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of reaction buffer after which 100 Âµg ch-TOG was added and incubated with the beads for a further 2 h. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of reaction buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE after the addition of 20 Âµl SDS-loading buffer.</p><p>CD spectroscopy was performed on a spectropolarimeter (J-715; Jasco) with temperature control. Clathrin protein samples were diluted to â¼0.1 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris.Cl and 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Far ultraviolet scans were taken from 250 to 190 nm at 30, 50, 66, and 90Â°C. Protein composition was determined using DichroWeb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whitmore and Wallace, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2008</xref>). TACC3 protein samples were at â¼150 ÂµM in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT, and data were analyzed using a custom-written Mathematica macro designed to compare reference spectra for Î± helix, Î² sheet, and random coil to the experimental data (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201211127/DC1" id="supp11">cdfit.ma</ext-link> in online supplemental material).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell biology</title><p>Cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. HEK293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate. In brief, 1 h before transfection the medium is replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium. For one well of a six-well plate, 5 Âµl of 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1.25 Âµg DNA were mixed with 0.1Ã TE buffer (1 mM Tris.Cl and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) to make up to 50 Âµl. 50 Âµl of 2Ã Hepes buffer (140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.05) was added and left for 1 min at 37Â°C to allow precipitate to form. Precipitate was added to the cells and the media changed 6 h later. HeLa cells were transfected by lipofection using Genejuice (Merck), according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For CHC and TACC3 RNAi, HEK293 cells were transfected 3 d before analysis. For TACC3 RNAi HeLa, cells were transfected 2 d before analysis. For Aurora A kinase inhibition, cells were incubated with 0.3 ÂµM MLN8237 for 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) or 40 min (Fig. S3 A) or with 0.7 ÂµM MLN8237 for 50 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Cells were fixed with PTEMF (50 mM Pipes, pH 7.2, 10 mM EGTA, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 4% paraformaldehyde) for 15 min at RT, and then permeabilized (PBS and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min. Cells were blocked (PBS, 3% BSA, and 5% goat serum) for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h. Cells were then rinsed with PBS, before incubation with secondary antibodies for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted with mowiol containing DAPI. For ch-TOG staining, cells were fixed with methanol at â20Â°C for 10 min and washed three times with PBS, and blocking was performed with 3% BSA only to allow costaining with sheep antiâGFP antibody (GFP fluorescence was reduced by methanol fixation).</p><p>For KS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>), pMito-PAGFP-FRB (MitoTrap) and pBrain-GFP-FKBP-TACC3-shTACC3 (or mutants) were transfected into HeLa cells. The MitoTrap was invisible during imaging but the PAGFP was activated by the multiphoton laser, which was the last line scanned in all cases. This allowed verification by eye that the cells captured did express this construct. 2 d after transfection, cells were treated with either 200 nM Rapamycin or an equivalent volume of ethanol (vehicle only control) for 20 min at 37Â°C. For combination of KS with Aurora A inhibition, 0.7 ÂµM MLN8237 or an equal volume of DMSO (vehicle control) was added for 50 min at 37Â°C, either before or after KS. Therefore, cells that were treated with MLN8237 before KS were exposed to MLN8237 for a total of 70 min, whereas those treated after KS were exposed to Rapamycin for a total of 70 min.</p><p>For MT depolymerization experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-clACC constructs and after 48 h were treated with 10 ÂµM nocodazole (1 h) before fixation and staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy and quantification</title><p>Confocal microscopy was performed on an SP2 (Leica) with a 63Ã (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective. GFP and Alexa Fluor 488 were excited using an Ar/Kr 488-nm laser, mCherry and Alexa Fluor 568 were excited with the 543 line of a He/Ne laser, and Alexa Fluor 633 was excited using a He/Ne 633-nm laser. DAPI was excited using a multiphoton laser. Images were averages of four scans. Epifluorescence images were captured with a microscope (TE2000U; Nikon) with 60Ã (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective with standard filter sets for DAPI, GFP, Alexa Fluor 568, and Alexa Fluor 633. For quantification, identical settings were used. For GFP-clACC and mCherry-tubulin live cell imaging, cells in CO<sub>2</sub>-independent media were imaged on glass-bottom dishes in a humidified chamber (Okolab) at 37Â°C. Images were captured with a DS-Qi1Mc camera and NiS Elements AR software.</p><p>Spindle enrichment analysis was essentially performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, clathrin or TACC3 images were captured using identical settings, and then either a 9 Ã 9-pixel (1.82 Âµm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) or a 5 Ã 5-pixel (0.56 Âµm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) region of interest was measured either over the spindle (away from poles), in the cytoplasm, or in a noncell region of background, using ImageJ. Background was subtracted from the spindle and cytoplasm measurements, and, where indicated, spindle fluorescence was then divided by cytoplasm fluorescence to give a spindle enrichment ratio. For analysis of mitotic index, GFP-expressing cells were assessed as being in either interphase or mitosis based on chromosome morphology, visualized using DAPI staining. The results of at least three independent experiments for each construct are shown. These were each normalized to the control from that experiment before calculating the mean of these normalized values. Statistical testing is described in the figure legends. Graphing was done using IgorPro (Wavemetrics). Figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p><p>For MT-binding experiments, tubulin was prepared from pig brains according to published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gell et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, brains are homogenized and then clarified by centrifugation and filtration. Tubulin is purified by cycles of polymerization (in the presence of GTP), centrifugation, and depolymerization. Labeled tubulin was obtained from Cytoskeleton, nucleotides were obtained from Jena Biosciences, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. YFP-CHC(1â574) and mCherry-TACC3(519â838) were dialyzed into MRB80 (80 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, with KOH, 1 mM EGTA, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with 50 mM KCl and adjusted to a concentration of 5 ÂµM. MT seeds were assembled from tubulin, biotin-tubulin, and Hilyte647-tubulin at a molar ratio of 25:1:1 in the presence of 1 mM GMP-CPP in MRB80 for 1 h at 37Â°C, diluted 20-fold with MRB80 with 2 ÂµM Taxol, and stored at RT. A 100-Âµm deep flow chamber was made from a slide and a hydrochloric acidâtreated coverslip using double-sided tape (Scotch; 3M) and passivated with PLL-PEG-50% biotin (Susos AG). Seeds were attached to this surface using streptavidin and blocked with 1 mg/ml k-casein. A reaction mix containing 14 ÂµM tubulin, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM GTP, 0.6 mg/ml k-casein, 0.2% methyl cellulose, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 50 mM glucose in MRB80, supplemented with 0.3 ÂµM Hilyte647-tubulin, was clarified for 8 min at 190,000 <italic>g</italic> in an airuge (Beckman Coulter) and the supernatant was added to the flow chamber and temporarily closed with sticky tape. MT assembly was allowed to occur for 30â60 min at 32Â°C under the microscope. A cleared protein mix containing 1 ÂµM YFP-CHC(1â574), 1 ÂµM mCherry-TACC3(519â838), 25 nM Aurora A, 1 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 50 mM glucose, and 2 ÂµM Taxol in MRB80 was then flowed into the chamber. YFP-CHC(1â574) and MTs were observed on a total internal reflection fluorescence system (Olympus) using a 100Ã NA 1.49 objective, 1.6Ã additional magnification, 488- and 640-nm laser lines, respectively, and an ImageEM-1k back-illuminated EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) under the control of xcellence software.</p></sec><sec><title>NMR spectroscopy and structural modeling</title><p>The structural model of CHCR0 was built using MODELLER 9.9 and an aligned CHCR0 sequence to search for homology to known CHC structures. The best model was merged with residues 395â483 from chain B of 1BPO and further refined using MolProbity (University of California San Francisco). Mutations were generated in Pymol and represented using CCP4mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNicholas et al., 2011</xref>). The structural models of TOG1 and TOG6 were produced using the PHYRE2 server (for template 2OF3) and SwissModel (for template 2QK1) and figures were generated in Pymol.</p><p>For NMR spectroscopy, 85% of backbone resonances were assigned using <sup>15</sup>N- and <sup>2</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N -labeled samples of Msps (aa 1591â1941). The assignment allowed the collection of secondary structure specific NOESY cross-peaks and secondary chemical shifts (CÎ±, CÎ², Câ, and HÎ±) in addition to <sup>15</sup>N R1 and R2 relaxation rates as well as <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects. All of these were combined to identify the two-folded domains and the secondary structure elements in these domains. The putative TOG domain fold in Msps 1591â1850 (TOG6) was further explored by collection of RDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tjandra and Bax, 1997</xref>) by aligning the protein in a solution of 5 mg/ml Pf1 phage. From a total of 220 assigned residues (out of 260 in the Msps 1591â1850 construct), RDCs could be obtained for 200 residues. The experimental values were compared with values calculated with PALES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zweckstetter, 2008</xref>) for homology models for Msps 1591â1850 based on crystal structures 2QK1 and 2OF3.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the localization of GFP-CHC mutants in mitotic HEK293 cells depleted of endogenous CHC. Fig. S2 shows normal folding of MBP-CHC(1â1074)-His<sub>6</sub> mutants. Fig. S3 shows that GFP-clACC does not require TACC3 or Aurora A kinase activity for mitotic spindle localization and that interphase MT bundles decorated with clACC have short-term protection from depolymerization. Fig. S4 shows normal folding of TACC3 629â838 Î678â681 and TACC3 629â838 Î682â688. Fig. S5 shows the identification of TOG6 domain in ch-TOG homologues.
