      <abstract>
        <p>Elucidating the function of highly conserved regulatory sequences is a significant challenge in genomics today. Certain intragenic highly conserved elements have been associated with regulating levels of core components of the spliceosome and alternative splicing of downstream genes. Here we identify mutations in one such element, a regulatory alternative exon of <italic>SNRPB</italic> as the cause of cerebroâcostoâmandibular syndrome. This exon contains a premature termination codon that triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay when included in the transcript. These mutations cause increased inclusion of the alternative exon and decreased overall expression of <italic>SNRPB</italic>. We provide evidence for the functional importance of this conserved intragenic element in the regulation of alternative splicing and development, and suggest that the evolution of such a regulatory mechanism has contributed to the complexity of mammalian development.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Although only 1.5% of the human genome consists of regions that are translated into proteins, a higher proportion (5â7%) has been shown to be under evolutionary constraint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. These non-coding conserved elements (NCEs) have been subclassified by somewhat arbitrary length and conservation criteria, and include ultraconserved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and highly conserved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> elements. The finding that many NCEs exhibit a higher level of conservation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and constraint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> than protein-coding sequences initially perplexed the genomics community. The elucidation that some NCEs have functional roles as long range enhancers of flanking genes, splicing regulators, functional co-activators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and their frequent association with developmental genes with the potential to regulate spatiotemporal expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, imply a largely regulatory role. The evolution of these complex regulatory networks may therefore have underpinned the emergence of our organismal complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
    <p>Evidence continues to emerge of a critical relationship between NCEs and alternative splicing (AS), the mechanism by which over 95% of human multi-exon genes create additional protein diversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Intragenic NCEs are preferentially associated with genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and are also often involved in the regulation of the expression of this class of genes by coupling AS with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Many genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing have ultra and highly conserved NCEs containing premature termination codons (PTCs), which can be alternatively spliced into the mature mRNAs to induce NMD in order to auto-regulate their expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. These AS-NMD-mediated mechanisms are presumed to be crucial to the homeostatic maintenance of the core spliceosome components and the regulation of AS in a spatiotemporally specific manner by gene auto- and cross-regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here we present mutations in a highly conserved, alternative PTC-containing exon of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptides B and B1 (<italic>SNRPB</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) as the cause of cerebroâcostoâmandibular syndrome (CCMS), a human multiple malformation disorder characterized by posterior rib gaps and Pierre Robin sequence (micrognathia, glossoptosis and cleft palate). This finding provides biological evidence of a direct link between conserved genomic elements, regulation of AS and human development, and therefore novel insight in the regulatory and developmental role of NCEs.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>A combination of whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing was used to identify causative mutations in a cohort of 10 unrelated families with CCMS, a rare genetic disorder characterized by micrognathia and posterior rib gaps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). All patients have typical features of CCMS except one patient (Family D) who had a more severe disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Nine of the 10 patients had heterozygous regulatory mutations in <italic>SNRPB</italic>. Overall, six distinct, novel mutations in <italic>SNRPB</italic> were identified. Five mutations are within the alternative PTC-containing exon (chr20:g.2447838_2447961) of <italic>SNRPB</italic>. These mutations cluster at the 5â² and 3â² ends of this exon within areas of high conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). A single patient had a 5â² untranslated region (UTR) mutation, which is predicted to introduce an out-of-frame translation initiation site (TIS) leading to a stop codon after 25 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the <italic>SNRPB-</italic>positive families, mutation analysis confirms that CCMS is an autosomal dominant disorder. We observed a high rate of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and two instances of non-penetrance.

      <p><italic>SNRPB</italic> encodes the protein isoforms SmB and SmBâ², which are core components of the U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 small ribonuclear protein (snRNP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> subunits of the major spliceosome. The highly conserved alternative exon within the second of six introns in <italic>SNRPB</italic> contains a PTC and has been shown to auto-regulate <italic>SNRPB</italic> levels through NMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The alternate exon, which has a sub-optimal 5â² splice site, is less frequently included when U1 snRNP levels are low as a result of SmB/Bâ² depletion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Conversely, it is more frequently included with SmB/Bâ² overexpression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We hypothesized that the mutations identified within this exon would alter the homeostatic balance between the coding full-length mRNA and alternative exon-containing transcripts targeted for degradation. Thus, we determined the effect of two of the alternative exon mutations using a splicing reporter minigene assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In the presence of the wild-type exon, 23% of all transcripts include this alternative exon, while introduction of either the chr20:g.2447951C&gt;G or chr20:g.2447847G&gt;T mutation shifts the proportion to 78% and 80%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Inclusion of the alternative PTC-containing exon was also assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTâPCR) in patient fibroblasts with the chr20:g.2447951C&gt;G, chr20:g.2449752C&gt;G, and chr20:g.2447847G&gt;T mutations. Expression of the PTC-containing transcript increased, whereas overall expression of <italic>SNRPB</italic> decreased compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Collectively, these results implicate the deregulation of <italic>SNRPB</italic> expression as the main disease mechanism for CCMS. Mutations in the alternative PTC-containing exon cluster at two sites, which overlap with known exonic splicing silencers (ESSs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In an experiment by Saltzman <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, deletion of both of these regions resulted in increased inclusion of the alternative exon in HeLa cells. Our results support the functional significance of these ESSs, which are perfectly conserved across placental mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), and suggest that the identified mutations weaken their silencing function. This would lead to the observed increase in the inclusion of this exon in CCMS, which is presumably the cause of the decreased overall <italic>SNRPB</italic> expression seen in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mutations identified in the alternative exon appear to cause a reduction in the amount of SmB/Bâ² that is consistent with a hypomorphic, but not a null, allele. qRTâPCR experiments in three patients show a narrow range of total <italic>SNRPB</italic> expression (0.53â0.66 relative to controls). In the minigene experiment, exclusion of the alternative exon was not eliminated in mutant transcripts, but occurred 20â22% of the time. We also have evidence that null alleles might result in a more severe phenotype as one patient without an alternative exon mutation has a 5â² UTR mutation predicted to result in a null allele causing haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). This patientâs phenotype was more severe than the remainder of the cohort, with only five pairs of poorly ossified ribs, a poorly ossified spine, cystic hygroma and multiple pterygia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Since none of the other patients carry truncating mutations in the gene (which would be much more likely to occur by chance than point mutations at two specific loci), and truncating mutations in or deletions encompassing <italic>SNRPB</italic> have not been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, we suggest that <italic>SNRPB</italic> haploinsufficiency may cause a more severe and likely lethal phenotype that is distinct from classic CCMS.</p>
      <p>CCMS joins a growing list of developmental disorders caused by mutations in core spliceosomal genes. Of particular interest are those with an overlapping craniofacial phenotype, such as Nager syndrome and the <italic>EFTUD2</italic>-related disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Interestingly, all of the above are caused by dominant mutations that are predicted to reduce expression of a component of the major spliceosome. It is known that the abundance of the spliceosomal machinery influences AS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In the case of <italic>SNRPB</italic>, RNAseq experiments have shown that specific AS exons are more sensitive to changes in SmB/Bâ² levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Among genes containing such exons, nucleic acid binding and RNA processing genes are over-represented. The <italic>SNRPB</italic> mutations presented here are therefore predicted to cross-regulate AS and expression of downstream genes. However, it is perplexing that a spliceosomal deficiency could cause such a strikingly specific phenotype. It may be that this deficiency affects a small number of transcripts that are particularly sensitive to spliceosomal protein levels. The identity of such transcripts remains speculative, however, animal models suggest that craniofacial abnormalities commonly found in CCMS are likely due to abnormal cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, whereas the rib abnormalities have long been postulated to be a consequence of abnormal cartilage formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Given the common craniofacial phenotypes associated with the above-mentioned disorders, it is possible that a common gene or network of genes is perturbed in all of these. Another possible explanation for the specificity of the CCMS phenotype is that the spliceosomal deficiency is exacerbated in a critical tissue or developmental stage owing to increased demand for spliceosomal activity. Studies of the two spliceosome-associated disorders spinal muscular atrophy and retinitis pigmentosa have shown that the retina and spinal cord, tissues that appear to be sensitive to a spliceosomal deficiency, show increased demand for spliceosomal proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our study highlights the importance of accurate AS in development, alludes to the broad network of splicing regulation, and demonstrates the regulatory and developmental importance of a highly conserved regulatory element. The alternative exon of <italic>SNRPB</italic> has high conservation at the nucleotide level throughout placental mammals (average GERP score 4.08), although to a lesser extent than the ultra-conserved elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In general, shorter human conserved elements are conserved among mammals, but not with other species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. It has been suggested that evolution of these elements is ongoing in vertebrates, and that specific specializations may reflect clade-specific adaptive regulatory changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. It is then possible that auto-regulation of <italic>SNRPB</italic> has evolved in mammals with the function of guiding specific cellular and developmental processes. Broadly, we therefore speculate that NCEs may have a significant role in regulating the phenotypic variation on which natural selection acts to drive the evolution of complex and highly integrated traits.</p>

        <p>A cohort of 10 CCMS families was assembled through the Finding Of Rare disease GEnes (FORGE) Canada Consortium (now called Care4Rare). All patients provided informed consent, and the study was approved by and complies with the ethical regulations of the institutional review board at the University of Calgary. An experienced clinical geneticist was responsible for each diagnosis of CCMS. Exclusion criteria included absence of micrognathia and posterior rib gaps. Other variable features include scoliosis, short stature, conductive hearing loss and congenital heart defects. Although intellectual disability is reported to be a common feature of CCMS, this was not prevalent in our cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

        <p>DNA was extracted from whole blood. Exome sequencing was performed for six unrelated cases and seven family members at the McGill University and GÃ©nome QuÃ©bec Innovation Centre. The SureSelect 50âMb Human All Exon kit (Agilent) was used for exon capture; v3 was used for families A, B and C, and v5 was used for families D, E and F. Captured regions were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina) with 100âbp paired-end reads. Reads were aligned to the hg19/GRCh37 human reference sequence using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and indel realignment was done with GATK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Duplicate reads were then marked using Picard ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">http://picard.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) and excluded from downstream analyses. Coverage of consensus coding sequence (CCDS) bases was assessed using the GATK, which showed that samples had on average &gt;94% of CCDS bases covered by at least 10 reads, and &gt;90% of CCDS bases covered by at least 20 reads. Single-nucleotide variants and short insertions and deletions were called with SAMtools mpileup<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> with the extended base alignment quality adjustment (-E). Only variants that were supported by â¥20% of reads were returned.

        <p>Unknown repressor proteins (red circles) bind the ESS regulatory sequences (red squares) in the alternatively spliced exon (in blue) of <italic>SNRPB</italic>. Their binding leads to exclusion of this alternative exon, and thus an increase of SmB/SmBâ² protein levels. Higher levels of these proteins then favour inclusion of the alternative exon, by an unknown mechanism, leading to NMD and a reduction of SmB/SmBâ² protein levels. In alleles mutated in CCMS patients, the binding of repressor proteins is thought to be abolished or reduced due to the mutations present in the regulatory sequences. This leads to continued inclusion of the alternative exon, and reduced SmB/SmBâ² protein levels due to NMD.</p>
