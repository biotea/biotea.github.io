          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 gene (CHD7) lead to CHARGE syndrome, an autosomal dominant multiple malformation disorder. Proteins involved in chromatin remodeling typically act in multiprotein complexes. We previously demonstrated that a part of human CHD7 interacts with a part of human CHD8, another chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein presumably being involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental (NDD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because identification of novel CHD7 and CHD8 interacting partners will provide further insights into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and ASD/NDD, we searched for additional associated polypeptides using the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometry.</p>

          <p>The hitherto uncharacterized FAM124B (Family with sequence similarity 124B) was identified as a potential interaction partner of both CHD7 and CHD8. We confirmed the result by co-immunoprecipitation studies and showed a direct binding to the CHD8 part by direct yeast two hybrid experiments. Furthermore, we characterized FAM124B as a mainly nuclear localized protein with a widespread expression in embryonic and adult mouse tissues.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our results demonstrate that FAM124B is a potential interacting partner of a CHD7 and CHD8 containing complex. From the overlapping expression pattern between Chd7 and Fam124B at murine embryonic day E12.5 and the high expression of Fam124B in the developing mouse brain, we conclude that Fam124B is a novel protein possibly involved in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In humans, CHD7 (NM _017780) is one of nine members of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) family that plays a role in controlling gene expression by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Mutations in the <italic>CHD7</italic> gene are the major cause of CHARGE syndrome (OMIM 214800), an autosomal dominant congenital malformation disorder characterized by the combination of eye, ear, craniofacial structure, and heart defects <xref rid="pone.0052640-Vissers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0052640-Wincent1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, in 5â10% of patients with a typical presentation of CHARGE syndrome and in 40â60% of patients with an atypical presentation the underlying cause of the symptoms remains unclear <xref rid="pone.0052640-Janssen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For other autosomal dominant disorders, e.g. Noonan syndrome, a genetic heterogeneity is known, wherein mutations in different genes lead to a similar phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesize that in CHARGE syndrome, besides mutations in <italic>CHD7,</italic> mutations in one or more additional and hitherto unknown genes are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
      <p>Proteins involved in chromatin remodeling are typically found in multiprotein complexes. In recent and earlier studies different CHD7 interacting partners have been described <xref rid="pone.0052640-Takada1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0052640-Zentner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In human neural crest-like cells CHD7 was shown to be associated with components of the BAF- (Brahma associated factor complex) and PBAF - complexes (Polybromo containing complex) <xref rid="pone.0052640-Bajpai1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Both belong to the SWI/SNF-family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and can act as transcriptional activators or repressors <xref rid="pone.0052640-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In murine embryonic stem (ES) cells co-localization between Chd7 and the proteins p300, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Smad1 and Stat3 at enhancer elements was shown <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> leading to the hypothesis that these proteins are cofactors in enhancer promoter interactions <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. CHD7 was also found to be associated with treacle, the protein that is involved in the pathogenesis of Treacher Collins syndrome <xref rid="pone.0052640-Zentner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These studies demonstrate that there are numerous CHD7 interacting partners, leading to the suggestion that there are cell type specific compositions of CHD7 containing complexes and that the subunits may change during development <xref rid="pone.0052640-Janssen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, we demonstrated that a part of the human CHD7 protein interacts with a part of the CHD8 protein, another CHD family member. Studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> demonstrated that <italic>kismet</italic> is the only gene related to the human subgroup III members (CHD6-CHD9). <italic>Kismet</italic> has a functional role in transcriptional regulation by promoting early elongation by RNA Polymerase II as well as by recruiting the histone methyltransferases ASH1 and TRX to chromatin <xref rid="pone.0052640-Srinivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Rodriguez-Paredes et al. suggested that in mammals the function of <italic>kismet</italic> is overtaken by several subgroup III members (CHD6-CHD9) <xref rid="pone.0052640-RodriguezParedes1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and we hypothesized that CHD7 and CHD8 build a core component of a complex with similar functions such as <italic>kismet</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0052640-Batsukh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. CHD8 was found to be associated with the WAR complex <xref rid="pone.0052640-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This complex includes WDR5, ASH2L and RbBP5 (WAR) and is known as a subcomplex of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog to TRX complexes. The MLL complexes act as histone H3 Lys-4 methyltransferases <xref rid="pone.0052640-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, CHD8 directly binds beta-catenin and negatively regulates beta-catenin-targeted gene expression <xref rid="pone.0052640-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Microdeletions, chromosomal rearrangements disrupting <italic>CHD8</italic> as well as de novo missense and nonsense mutations in the <italic>CHD8</italic> gene were described in autism spectrum (ASD) and in neurodevelopmental (NDD) disorder patients, indicating that alterations in <italic>CHD8</italic> can contribute to ASD and NDD <xref rid="pone.0052640-Zahir1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0052640-Talkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Identification of novel CHD7 and CHD8 interacting partners will provide further insights into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and ASD/NDD. Therefore, we tried to detect new binding partners by using the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometry. We identified FAM124B (Family with sequence similarity 124B) as a potential interaction partner of both CHD7 and CHD8. Additionally, we confirmed the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and performed direct yeast two hybrid experiments. Furthermore, we examined the intracellular localization and tissue specific expression of Fam124B during mouse embryogenesis and in adult mouse tissues.</p>

        <title>Identification of FAM124B as Part of the CHD7 and CHD8 Interactomes</title>
        <p>In order to identify novel CHD7 and CHD8 interaction partners we applied stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometry <xref rid="pone.0052640-Ong1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Oellerich1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052640-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To achieve differential isotope labeling of HeLa cells, one cell batch was cultured in the presence of lysine and arginine containing light (L) isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>N, <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>l</sc>-arginine) while the other batch was cultured in the presence of lysine and arginine containing heavy (H) isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>
<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-lysine and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>
<sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>-arginine). Accordingly, the two culture conditions confer distinct molecular masses on the cellular proteins and in this way proteins derived from SILAC-labeled cells can be distinguished and thus attributed to the L- or H-labeled cell batch by mass spectrometry. For elucidation of the CHD7- or CHD8 interactomes, the H-labeled cells were firstly co-transfected with the plasmids CHD7-CR1-3-pCMV-HA (containing amino acids 1593-2178, NP_060250.2, in fusion with an HA-tag) and CHD8-pCMV-cmyc (spanning amino acids 1789â2302, NP_065971.2, in fusion with an cmyc-tag). 24 hours post transfection, expression of the tagged proteins was confirmed by western blotting. Subsequently, the respective H-labeled cells were lysed and the CHD7 part was purified by anti-HA immunoprecipitation. As a negative control the same immunoprecipitation was performed in lysates of non-transfected L-labeled HeLa cells. The purified proteins from both the H- and L-states were then pooled in equimolar amounts and subsequently digested with the endoproteinase trypsin. Derived peptides were identified by liquid-chromatography (LC)-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), allocated to the corresponding proteins by database search and finally quantified using the MaxQuant software. An at least five-fold enrichment of heavy versus light peptides was considered to mark proteins that were specifically co-purified with the HA-tagged CHD7 part. The same experimental workflow was also performed with inverse labeling. In at least three biological replicates FAM124B was co-purified with CHD7 and CHD8, identifying this so far uncharacterized protein as a novel effector of the CHD7/8 interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052640.s002">Table S1</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052640.s004">S3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Information of the genomic and cDNA structure of FAM124B was obtained from NCBI database. In humans, two transcript variants are described. Transcript variant 1 contains two exons with the ATG in exon one and the stop codon in exon 2 resulting in a protein with 455 amino acids (NP_001116251.1). Transcript variant 2 contains an alternate exon with an in-frame stop codon leading to a shorter protein product with 272 amino acids (NP_079061.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052640-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

            <p>In humans, there are two transcript variants of FAM124B. Transcript variant 1 codes for a protein with 455 amino acids (NP_001116251.1), while transcript variant 2 leads to a shorter protein product with 272 amino acids (NP_079061.2). Both variants have the first 244 amino acids in common. All used FAM124B variant 1 and 2 constructs are full length constructs. Bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence of FAM124B failed to identify any known functional domain, while CHD7 and CHD8 consist of two N-terminal chromodomains (Chromo), followed by a SWI2/SNF2-like ATPase/helicase domain (Helicase/ATPase), three conserved regions (CR1-3), a SANT domain and two BRK domains. The black lines mark the regions cloned into the Yeast two hybrid (pGBKT7, pGADT7) and Co-IP (pCMV-HA, pCMV-cmyc) vectors.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Loss of function mutations in <italic>CHD7</italic> lead to CHARGE syndrome, a well known malformation syndrome affecting several organs and sensory systems. CHD7 regulates the transcription of tissue specific target genes through the mechanism of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Zentner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Janssen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Chromatin remodeling proteins are typically found in large multiprotein complexes. For CHD7, several tissue specific interacting partners are described <xref rid="pone.0052640-Takada1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Bajpai1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Zentner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, it can be suggested that there are cell type and developmental stage specific compositions of CHD7 containing complexes. However, the precise complex compositions for each tissue are still unknown. In an earlier study, we demonstrated that a part of human CHD7 interacts with a part of human CHD8 both directly and indirectly, via potential linker proteins <xref rid="pone.0052640-Batsukh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Loss of function mutations in <italic>CHD8</italic> as well as de novo missense mutations were described in autism spectrum (ASD) and neurodevelopmental (NDD) disorder patients <xref rid="pone.0052640-Zahir1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0052640-Talkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Interestingly, Betancur and colleagues described autism spectrum disorders in about two thirds of children with CHARGE syndrome <xref rid="pone.0052640-Betancur1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which supports our hypothesis of a CHD7-CHD8 containing complex regulating the same cell type specific target genes.</p>
      <p>The identification and characterization of associated factors of a CHD7-CHD8 containing complex might play an important role in understanding the pathophysiology of CHARGE syndrome and ASD/NDD. Therefore, to further characterize this complex and to identify additional associated polypeptides interacting with the recently described human CHD7 and CHD8 part, we used the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometry. As a result of three biological replicates we identified the hitherto uncharacterized protein FAM124B as a potential interacting partner. In humans, two FAM124B transcript variants are present, while in mice, only one transcript, homologous to the human transcript variant 1, exists. The interaction of both human FAM124B transcript variants with the CHD7 and CHD8 part was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Direct yeast-two hybrid studies were performed to specify the FAM124B - CHD7 - CHD8 interaction areas. Both transcripts of human FAM124B interact directly with the CHD8 part containing the amino acids 1789â2302 (NP_065971.2), while the FAM124B - CHD7 interaction is an indirect interaction or the interacting area is outside of the used CHD7 part spanning amino acids 1591-2181 (NP_060250.2). The biological role of human FAM124B or its orthologs in <italic>P.troglodytes, C.lupus, B.taurus, R.norvegicus, M.musculus, G.gallus, D.rerio</italic> is still unknown. Bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence failed to identify any known functional domain. To gain further insight into the biological role of FAM124B and its mouse ortholog, we examined the subcellular localization and the expression pattern. Immunofluorescence microscopy of overexpressed FAM124B indicated that overexpressed FAM124B is localized in the nucleus. Using the FAM124B antibody we could observe in untransfected HeLa cells a nuclear, but weaker signal as well, possibly indicating a lower expression of endogenous FAM124B. CHD8 is described as a nuclear protein as well <xref rid="pone.0052640-Ishihara1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Concerning CHD7, a dual localization in the nucleoplasm and in the nucleolus was observed <xref rid="pone.0052640-Zentner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, the interaction between FAM124B, CHD8 and CHD7 is supposed to take place in the nucleus.</p>
      <p>We detected Fam124B expression in various adult mouse tissues, with highest expression in lung and heart, followed by kidney, brain and testis, whereas its expression was weakest in liver tissue. No Fam124B expression could be observed in blood cells. In adult mouse brain sections, we demonstrated Fam124B expression in several areas. Within the brain, high expression levels were found in the cortex, granular and purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, thalamic nuclei, caudate putamen, and hippocampus.</p>
      <p>CHD8 expression was previously noted in various adult mouse tissues including heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and testis <xref rid="pone.0052640-Ishihara1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In adult mouse tissues, CHD7 expression was determined in the retina, in the cornea, brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, lung, olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb <xref rid="pone.0052640-Vissers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Layman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. According to these previously described data we observed an overlapping expression pattern between CHD7, Chd8 and Fam124B in adult mouse tissues. Due to the fact that CHARGE syndrome is a developmental disorder and NDD/ASD are caused by abnormal brain development, we extended our Fam124B expression studies to embryonic tissues. The expression pattern of CHD7 during development has been studied in embryos of different mammalian species, before <xref rid="pone.0052640-Bosman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Aramaki1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Sanlaville1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Hurd1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Layman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. During mouse development, Chd7 was found to be expressed at E12.5 in a wide range of head tissues (several brain areas with highest expression in proximity to the ventricles, in the choroid plexus, developing olfactory epithelium, ganglia of the cranial nerves, otic and optic pits, and the developing inner ear) and several regions of the body (especially the dorsal root ganglia and lung epithelium, as well as stomach epithelium, kidney and heart) <xref rid="pone.0052640-Bosman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0052640-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Fam124B expression at E12.5 was found in a variety of embryonic tissues (e.g. several brain areas, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, developing cochlea and surrounding tissues, lung, heart, and kidney), as well. Similar to the results of adult mouse tissues, Fam124B expression at E12.5 correlated in many embryonic tissues with the Chd7 expression pattern, and therefore Fam124B was found to be expressed in organs affected in CHARGE syndrome.</p>
      <p>It has already been shown that CHD7 binds to methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) at enhancer elements and modifies cell type specific gene expression in a fine-tuning manner <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Schnetz and colleagues hypothesized that the binding of a CHD7 containing complex to enhancer elements may modulate the expression rate of target genes through enhancer-promotor interactions <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In mouse ES cells, a subset of Chd7 sites colocalize with p300, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. The subset of Chd7 sites which are not co-occupied by these proteins can also enhance transcription <xref rid="pone.0052640-Schnetz2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the associated factors of these Chd7 sites are still unknown. Possibly, the identified novel Fam124B may serve as an associated factor involved in Chd7 enhancer-mediated transcription. Furthermore, the high Fam124B expression in the developing mouse brain and in neuronal tissues at embryonic day E12.5 might indicate a role of FAM124B together with CHD8 in neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorders.</p>
      <p>In summary, we identified FAM124B as a binding partner of a part of CHD7 and CHD8. We conclude that FAM124B is an associated factor of a CHD7 and CHD8 containing complex. Fam124B is widely expressed at mouse developmental stage E12.5 with an overlapping expression to Chd7 and high expression in the developing mouse brain. Therefore, we assume a role for FAM124B in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and NDD/ASD. The results of our interaction studies, the subcellular localization, and expression profile of FAM124B provide valuable information and represent a starting point for further functional investigations on FAM124B and its possible role in CHARGE syndrome and NDD/ASD.</p>

        <p>Two HeLa cell populations were grown in SILAC DMEM culture media (10% dialyzed FBS and 1% penstrep) (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The â<italic>lightâ</italic> SILAC medium was supplemented with unlabeled <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>l</sc>-arginine, while the âheavyâ SILAC medium was supplemented with arginine and lysine containing heavy isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-lysine and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>
<sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>-arginine). Upon metabolic labeling of the cells this leads to a mass shift of +6 and +10 Da per incorporated arginine and lysine, respectively. After at least 5 cell passages, co-transfection with the previously described plasmids CHD7-CR1-3-pCMV-HA and CHD8-pCMV-cmyc <xref rid="pone.0052640-Batsukh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> into either L- or H-labeled HeLa cells was performed.

        <p>Adult wild type CD1 mouse tissues and E12.5 embryos were paraffin embedded according to standard procedures. From the paraffin embedded tissues 7 Âµm sections were made and incubated overnight at 45Â°C. After a three time xylene incubation (10, 5, 5 minutes) a series of ethanol incubation (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%) and a washing step with DPBS for 2 minutes followed. Slides were cooked with an antigen retrieval buffer (citric acid 0.1 M; EDTA 0.01%, pH 6.2) in a steam cooker for 10 minutes, followed by a cool down step on ice for at least 10 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 6% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution in water for 15 minutes. The solution was tapped off from the slides and blocked with horse serum (Vectastain Universal Quick kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 minutes in a humidity chamber at room temperature. Rabbit anti-FAM124B (Protein Tech), rabbit anti-CHD7 (abcam, ab31824) and rabbit anti-CHD8 (abcam, ab84527) antibodies were diluted at 1â¶50, 1â¶50 and 1â¶100, respectively. The primary antibodies were incubated at 4Â°C overnight. After washing with TPBS for 5 minutes, a Pan specific secondary antibody (Vectastain Universal Quick kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied for maximum 10 minutes and washed again with TPBS for 5 minutes. Streptavidin peroxidase (Vectastain Universal Quick kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied on the slides for 5 minutes. Slides were then transferred to TPBS washing buffer for minimum 5 minutes. The staining was developed with DAB substrate (Roche Diagnostik GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for around 2 minutes. The slides were rinsed for minimum 5 minutes under tap water and counterstained in mayorâs hematoxylin for 20â40 seconds and washed with tap water 3â4 times. Mounting of slides were done with Aqua polymount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Imaging was performed and processed using a BX60 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) and the analySIS program Cell-Sens Dimension.</p>
