  <body>
    <p id="P2">Cells control crucial biological processes through the reversible conjugation of diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs), ranging from small chemical groups, such as phosphorylation, to complex carbohydrates and entire small proteins. ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is the best-characterized nucleotide-based PTM, with a wealth of evidence pointing to its biomedical importance, especially in DNA damage responses and cancer therapy<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In contrast to the limited amino acid specificities of most PTMs, nearly all the chemically reactive amino acid side-chains have been reported as targets of ADPr<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. However it is difficult to study most of these ADPr linkages <italic>in vivo</italic>, even to abundant targets like histones. Histone ADPr is primarily studied in DNA damage repair<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, although a detailed understanding is constrained by ignorance of the exact sites in cellular contexts.</p>
    <p id="P3">Given the biological and clinical importance of ADPr, we set out to analyze histone ADPr in cells using mass spectrometry (MS). Although endogenous histones can be easily isolated from cells, poor sequence coverage generally hampers analysis of marks. Conventional tryptic digestion of histones generates many peptides too short for productive MS analysis. Over the last decade, several sample preparation strategies have been proposed to reduce these systematic blind spots, typically integrating multiple parallel digestions based on chemical derivatizations and proteolysis with less efficient and specific proteases<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Despite these sophisticated approaches, it has been practically impossible to obtain full sequence coverage for all histones.</p>
    <p id="P4">We have developed a simple method for high-coverage sequencing of histones based on the popular FASP (âfilter-aided sample preparationâ) approach<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, coupling partial trypsin digestion to generate longer peptides with ultrafiltration to remove undigested proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Digestion of purified histones by this âpartial FASPâ strategy is reproducible according to SDS-PAGE analysis, correlation of histone peptide intensities and overlap of identified peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Results</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Our approach allows full sequence coverage of core histones (although the C-terminal peptide of H2A is occasionally lost) and above 95% coverage of H1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) by generating peptides with higher mass and charge than in standard FASP protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2b-d and 3</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">To isolate histones from cell lines, we modified a method combining sulfuric acid extraction with sulfopropyl-Sepharose (SP) chromatography<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a-b</xref>). Importantly, cell lysis in sulfuric acid preserves the physiological level of ADPr by preventing the artifactual protein ADPr observed upon lysis in non-denaturing conditions<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and the PARG-mediated degradation of polymers to free ADP-ribose, which can lead to non-enzymatic ADPr<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c-d</xref>). Although this isolation approach combined with partial FASP is sufficient for detecting ADPr by MS, to increase sensitivity we also enriched ADP-ribosylated peptides with a recently developed phosphoproteomic approach<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In order to make poly-ADPr sites detectable as well, we repeated the analyses after treating the histone peptides with a Nudix hydrolase, which converts both mono-ADP-ribose and poly-ADP-ribose to phospho-ribose<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. We did not use PARG, as this can lead to non-enzymatic ADPr through the generation of free ADP-ribose<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P6">All peptide samples were analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS. Initial HCD (higher-energy collisional dissociation) MS/MS analysis confidently detected several peptides modified by ADPr. While low-mass ions resulting from fragmentation of ADP-ribose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) unmistakably confirmed the presence of ADP-ribose<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, we could not confidently localize the modification sites with HCD, since the ADPr-peptide bond appeared to be extremely labile, a behavior also observed for O-glycopeptides<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. To precisely map the modified residues, we employed an alternative fragmentation mode, ETD (electron transfer dissociation), on an orbitrap Fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Although in theory ETD is the best method for mapping labile PTMs, its lower sensitivity makes it less suited for detecting ADPr in complex mixtures. To circumvent this limitation we exploited the lability of ADP-ribose, triggering acquisition of high-resolution ETD spectra based on the presence of adenine ions in rapidly-acquired HCD spectra<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Another drawback of ETD is that its efficiency is charge-state dependent: fully digested tryptic peptides fragment poorly, being primarily doubly charged. This limitation is solved by partial FASP, which generates highly-charged peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>) ideal for ETD analysis.</p>
    <p id="P7">All MS/MS data were processed with MaxQuant<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, allowing ADPr on any chemically-reactive amino acid, with stringent criteria for peptide identification and PTM localization, followed by extensive manual validation of fragmentation spectra. We have identified twelve previously unknown, unique ADPr marks, six on the N-terminal tails of the four core histones and six on different H1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>). Unexpectedly, we discovered ADPr on serine. For ten sites, high-resolution ETD spectra unambiguously pinpoint serine as the modified residue. Two modification sites near the N-termini of H2A and H4 have proven difficult to localize exactly; although some spectra suggest ADPr of Ser1, our data cannot rule out modification on Arg3 or Lys5. Spectra of longer histone peptides produced by partial FASP revealed the H2BS6 ADPr site on six distinct H2B variants. Interestingly, the sequences surrounding this H2B site are similar to the sequences of six other histone ADPr sites. Although we cannot perform rigorous sequence motif analysis on so few sites, a pattern appears to emerge with lysine before the modified serine, usually followed by alanine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">A large number of aspartates, glutamates, arginines and lysines have been identified as ADPr acceptors on histones modified <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Since we did not observe these sites in our <italic>in vivo</italic> samples, we performed a series of experiments to ensure that our preparation is not biased towards serine. First, to be sure that acidic purification did not eliminate ADPr sites, we analyzed histones purified from cells without acid extraction, namely commercial HeLa histones and histones obtained by anti-FLAG purification. These experiments confirmed the modification of serine and did not conclusively identify ADPr on any other amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Although serine-linked ADPr has been described as acid labile at 37Â°C<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, it survives our low-temperature acidic steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Second, to ensure that the slightly alkaline pH of digestion did not introduce bias, we lowered the digestion pH to 7.3<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but found no additional ADPr sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 8</xref>). Finally, by performing <italic>in vitro</italic> ADPr reactions on histones, we found that our method can detect ADPr on amino acids other than serine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). While these experiments do not exclude the existence of histone ADPr on other amino acids under different conditions, they only support the modification of serine in the <italic>in vivo</italic> samples examined here, even though other sites are detectable by our method.</p>
    <p id="P9">Histones have long been known to be acceptors of ADPr in response to DNA damage<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. To investigate whether our newly identified serine ADPr marks respond to DNA damage, we performed quantitative proteomics using SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. All the detected ADPr marks increased 10- to 27-fold in human osteosarcoma cells exposed to oxidative DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the canonical histone PTMs remained largely unchanged, except for two ubiquitination marks that increased slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset</xref>). Histone phosphorylation marks, including gamma-H2AX, a known responder to DNA damage, did not change after only 10 minutes of exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, an early time point with maximum ADPr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). The suppression of DNA damage-induced serine ADPr in cells treated with the inhibitor olaparib suggests that this modification is enzymatic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9b-d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Our study not only establishes serine ADPr as a novel histone mark but thereby identifies the first proteins modified by ADPr on serine. An early report based on indirect characterization of chemical stability of ADPr-protein bonds suggested serine as a possible acceptor of ADPr<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Here we provide the first direct evidence of proteins linked to ADP-ribose through the hydroxyl group of serine, a linkage chemically identical to the o-glycosidic bond linking ADP-ribose monomers in poly-ADP-ribose<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the bond between carbohydrates and o-glycosylated proteins<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Six out of the twelve reported ADPr sites have also been reported to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting possible interplay between these two PTMs. ADPr on serines 10 and 28 of H3 is particularly interesting, since these residues undergo crucial phosphorylation during mitosis<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P11">Owing to the chemical instability of ADPr, studying this PTM at the molecular level is not trivial. We have developed an MS-based approach for mapping and quantifying biologically relevant histone ADPr marks in cells, and in the process identified serine ADPr as a new histone mark. Given the large number of proteins ADP-ribosylated after DNA damage<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, we expect serine ADPr not to be restricted to histones. This work provides both a new direction of enquiry in the role of ADPr in cellular function, and a new tool with which to explore it.</p>

        <p id="P15">Briefly, cells were stimulated with 2 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 minutes, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed by rotation in 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 4ÂºC for 2 hours. The lysate was centrifuged at 2200 g at 4ÂºC for 20 min. The pellet with non-soluble proteins and cell debris was discarded. Perchloric acid (PCA) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 4% v/v. After overnight incubation at 4ÂºC, this fraction was centrifuged at 21,000 g at 4ÂºC for 45 min. The supernatant containing PCA-soluble proteins was concentrated using 10 kDa cut-off centrifugal concentrators (Vivacon 500, Sartorius Stedim). The pellet (PCA-insoluble proteins) was washed subsequently with 4% PCA (2 x 1 ml), 0.2% HCl in acetone (2 x 1 ml) and acetone (2 x 1 ml). After drying, the pellet was resuspended in Binding Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH: 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). For ion exchange chromatography, sulfopropyl(SP)-Sepharose resin (#S1799, Sigma-Aldrich) was packed into a column and pre-equilibrated with 10 volumes of Binding Buffer. The resuspended pellet containing PCA-insoluble proteins was passed through the column. The resin was washed with 10 volumes of Binding Buffer and 30 volumes of Washing Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.6 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). Proteins were eluted with Elution Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) in 10 fractions.</p>
        <p id="P16">Eluted proteins were precipitated overnight in 4% (v/v) PCA at 4ÂºC. The fractions were then centrifuged at 21,000 g at 4ÂºC for 45 min and the resulting pellets were washed with 4% PCA (2 x 1 ml), 0.2% HCl in acetone (2 x 1 ml) and acetone (2 x 1 ml). This acidic precipitation appears to cause some degree of modification loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P17">To avoid this loss we also implemented a variation of the protocol for purifying the core histones without protein precipitation with PCA. Briefly, sulfuric acid-soluble proteins were neutralized with 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0. NaCl, EDTA and DTT were added to a final concentration of 0.5 M, 2 mM, 1 mM, respectively and core histones were purified using SP-Sepharose resin as described above. Proteins eluted with Elution Buffer were concentrated using a C18 cartridge (hydrophobicity interaction; Sep-Pak SPE Waters). We would propose this approach as a viable lower-loss alternative for histone recovery.</p>

With non-denaturing lysis buffers, such as the modified RIPA buffer used by Jungmichel et al., this phenomenon can be prevented by the addition of PARP-1 inhibitors, although other enzymes, such as PARG, cannot be easily inactivated. The important advantage of our method is that virtually all the conjugation/deconjugation enzymes are inactive during lysis. This is crucial to prevent both non-physiological (but enzymatic) ADPr and non-enzymatic ADPr. With acid extraction PARG is prevented from generating free ADPr via post-lysis degradation of PAR.</p>

Our methods for targeted acquisition of ETD spectra of modified precursors fell into two essential types â offline and online.
