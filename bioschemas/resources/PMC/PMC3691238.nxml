      <abstract>
        <p>Serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs) are a superfamily of highly conserved proteins that play a key role in controlling the activity of proteases in diverse biological processes. The <italic>SERPIN</italic> cluster located at the 14q32.1 region includes the gene coding for SERPINA1, and a highly homologous sequence, <italic>SERPINA2</italic>, which was originally thought to be a pseudogene. We have previously shown that <italic>SERPINA2</italic> is expressed in different tissues, namely leukocytes and testes, suggesting that it is a functional SERPIN. To investigate the function of <italic>SERPINA2,</italic> we used HeLa cells stably transduced with the different variants of SERPINA2 and SERPINA1 (M1, S and Z) and leukocytes as the <italic>in vivo</italic> model. We identified SERPINA2 as a 52 kDa intracellular glycoprotein, which is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), independently of the variant analyzed. SERPINA2 is not significantly regulated by proteasome, proposing that ER localization is not due to misfolding. Specific features of SERPINA2 include the absence of insoluble aggregates and the insignificant response to cell stress, suggesting that it is a non-polymerogenic protein with divergent activity of SERPINA1. Using phylogenetic analysis, we propose an origin of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> in the crown of primates, and we unveiled the overall conservation of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> and <italic>A1</italic>. Nonetheless, few SERPINA2 residues seem to have evolved faster, contributing to the emergence of a new advantageous function, possibly as a chymotrypsin-like SERPIN. Herein, we present evidences that <italic>SERPINA2</italic> is an active gene, coding for an ER-resident protein, which may act as substrate or adjuvant of ER-chaperones.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The superfamily of <underline>ser</underline>ine <underline>p</underline>rotease <underline>in</underline>hibitors (SERPINs) comprises a large number of proteins widely distributed among animals, plants, viruses, and bacteria, characterized by a conserved highly-order tertiary structure. In general, SERPINs act as inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteases in diverse biological process such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, inflammation and apoptosis. However, a small fraction of SERPINs exert other roles outside of proteolysis regulation for example as molecular chaperones, hormone transporters or storage proteins <xref rid="pone.0066889-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Irving2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mechanistically, the inhibitory properties of SERPINs are correlated with their ability to undergo a striking conformational transition (âstressedâ to ârelaxedâ transition). SERPINs present a pseudosubstrate in an exposed reactive centre loop (RCL) able to entrap proteases. Once cleaved by the target protease, the RCL moves to the opposite pole of the molecule, through a Î²-sheet arrangement â the shutter; distorting the protease structure and thereby causing its irreversible loss of catalytic activity <xref rid="pone.0066889-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Janciauskiene1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Under physiological conditions, the plasticity of SERPINs allows these proteins to adopt divergent conformations and assembly states. Conversely, it also renders SERPINs sensitive to single mutations of which there are many altering protein folding, biosynthesis and functional activity <xref rid="pone.0066889-Janciauskiene1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Lomas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the human Î±1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), the major protease inhibitor in the serum, this molecular vulnerability is well illustrated by the Z allele. This variant results from the amino acid replacement E342K, and affects the RCL leading to a decrease of inhibitory activity and to the polymerization and accumulation of SERPINA1 (â¼80%) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref rid="pone.0066889-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The deficiency of Î±1-antitrypsin is mainly associated to the ZZ genotype and it affects 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 7,000 individuals of European descend <xref rid="pone.0066889-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-ATSERS1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The major clinical manifestations of the disease are the early pulmonary emphysema, due to the unopposed action of the neutrophil elastase in the lower respiratory tract and the hepatic disease caused by the cytotoxic effect of protein aggregation in hepatocytes <xref rid="pone.0066889-Janciauskiene1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-ATSERS1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Apart from the Z allele, other common variants of SERPINA1 are described and include the M1, M2, and M3 alleles, linked to normal circulating protein levels; and the S allele, which results from the amino acid replacement E264V at the shutter region of the molecule <xref rid="pone.0066889-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. To a lower extent, the S allele also leads to the accumulation of the misfolded protein in the ER (â¼50%), however its association to disease is mainly restricted to the lung pathology, and mostly in smokers with SZ genotype <xref rid="pone.0066889-ATSERS1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Dahl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The gene encoding SERPINA1 is located on chromosome 14q32.1 in a gene cluster comprising 10 additional members of the <italic>SERPIN</italic> superfamily (<italic>A2</italic>, <italic>A3</italic>, <italic>A4</italic>, <italic>A5</italic>, <italic>A6</italic>, <italic>A9</italic>, <italic>A10</italic>, <italic>A11</italic>, <italic>A12</italic> and <italic>A13</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0066889-Namciu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Marsden1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Most genes present a common organization, with one untranslated exon and four coding exons, typical of Î±1-antytrypsin-like SERPINs (clade A), suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestral gene through a series of duplication events <xref rid="pone.0066889-Atchley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-vanGent1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. With the exception of <italic>SERPINA2,</italic> which has a high sequence similarity to <italic>SERPINA1</italic> (â¼80% sequence identity) all other genes are likely to represent ancient events of SERPIN diversification <xref rid="pone.0066889-Atchley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>
<italic>SERPINA2</italic> was originally thought to be a pseudogene because no promoter region or liver expression was detected, and a significant level of sequence degeneration was observed, which included a disrupted starting codon (AT<underline>G</underline> to AT<underline>A</underline>) and a 2 kb deletion encompassing exon IV and part of exon V <xref rid="pone.0066889-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Hofker1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Currently, several lines of evidence indicate that <italic>SERPINA2</italic> has an active isoform and is differently expressed from its closest homologue, <italic>SERPINA1: SERPINA2</italic> is mostly expressed in the testes and leukocytes, having a residual expression in the liver; whereas <italic>SERPINA1</italic> is highly expressed in the liver, has lower expression rates in leukocytes and no measurable expression in the testes <xref rid="pone.0066889-Seixas1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, translation of the full transcript of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> is predicted to encode a regular SERPIN with a distinct inhibitory activity from SERPINA1â reactive site (P1-P1â) composed by tryptophan and serine instead of methionine and serine <xref rid="pone.0066889-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Seixas1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. On the other hand, the inactive form of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> has two disrupting mutations (ATA and 2 kb deletion) in strong linkage disequilibrium, and it has no recognizable transcript. In African populations, this inactive isoform was found to be associated with too little genetic variation for its given frequency (â¼ 58%), as if it was favoured by natural selection acting on a beneficial variant. Furthermore, the loss of SERPINA2 was proposed as an ongoing adaptive process possibly associated to an advantageous role in fertility or in hostâpathogen interactions <xref rid="pone.0066889-Seixas1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is eminent to address whether <italic>SERPINA2</italic> is a true gene, determining to which extent it has diverged from <italic>SERPINA1</italic>. To achieve this, we combined a series of molecular and cellular assays using HeLa cells stably expressing different variants of SERPINA2 and A1 and in leukocytes, with a set of phylogenetic analysis performed using multiple coding sequences of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> and <italic>A1</italic> homologues.</p>

        <title>Expression of SERPINA2 and SERPINA1 in HeLa Cell Line</title>
        <p>To characterize the properties of SERPINA2 we generated HeLa cell lines stably expressing recombinant forms of SERPINA2 and A1 linked to a V5-tag (â¼3 kDa). A total of seven cell lines were obtained, these included the empty vector (mock), three cells lines expressing different SERPINA2 variants detected in a testes cDNA library: V1 (P308âK320); V2 (L308âE320); and V3 (P308âE320); and three cells lines expressing the SERPINA1 variants: M1 (V213-E264-E342), S (V213-V264-E342) and Z (A213-E264-K342) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s001">Figure S1</xref>). No traces of <italic>SERPINA1</italic> or <italic>A2</italic> expression were detected in primary HeLa cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The expression of SERPINA2 and A1 was evaluated at intracellular and extracellular level by Western Blot, using a monoclonal antibody against V5-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066889-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to SERPINA1, which could be detected at both levels, SERPINA2 was detected exclusively in the intracellular fraction (cell lysates). For SERPINA1 two bands corresponding to the partially glycosylated (â¼55 kDa) and to the fully glycosylated (â¼58 kDa) proteins were observed at the intracellular level, while for SERPINA2 a single band was identified (â¼55 kDa). At the extracellular level, only the fully glycosylated (â¼58 kDa) band corresponding to the mature protein was detected for SERPINA1, with expected differences in secretion levels of the different variants analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066889-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). After the enzymatic treatment with Endoglycosydase H (Endo H) and N-glycosydase F (NGF), the partially glycosylated immature form of SERPINA1 was reduced to approximately 49 kDa, while the fully glycosylated forms were resistant to Endo H and reduced only by NGF. The single form of SERPINA2 was reduced by both enzymes into two bands of 47 kDa and 49 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066889-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that all the variants of SERPINA2 are partially glycosylated.</p>

        <p>To address if SERPINA2 was accumulating in the ER, we carried out double-labeling assays against the V5-tag and two ER markers, calnexin (CANX) or Protein Disulfide-Isomerase A3 (PDIA3). The positive overlap with the ER markers in cells expressing SERPINA2 was similar to those of S and Z variants, confirming the localization of SERPINA2 in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066889-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm the subcellular localization of SERPINA2 in the ER we isolated proteins from cytoplasmatic and membranous fractions, the last containing the plasma membrane, ER and Golgi compartments. The segregation of SERPINA2 in the membrane fraction together with a known ER protein provides further support for its localization in ER structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s006">Figure S6</xref>). SERPINA2 variants and S and Z variants of SERPINA1 were found as a single 55 kDa band resulting from the early ER glycosylation, whereas the normal secreted M1 variant was also associated to the 58 kDa band corresponding to mature protein processed by Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Degradation of Misfolded Proteins</title>
        <p>The mechanisms of ER associated-degradation (ERAD) and autophagy have been implicated in the cellular clearance of different misfolded variants of SERPINs identified in the ER <xref rid="pone.0066889-Teckman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Kroeger1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To determine whether proteolytic pathways regulate differently SERPINA2 and A1, stably transduced HeLa cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor N-Acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal (ALLN) and with the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3MA). In all SERPIN variants, the inhibition of the proteasome by ALLN led to increased levels of recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066889-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A significant increase of S and Z alleles was detected, while the non-deficient allele M1 and SERPINA2 were less affected and seemed regulated by the proteasome in a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0066889-g004">Figure 4</xref>). On the other hand, autophagy inhibition with 3MA resulted in the accumulation of large protein granules in the Z variant, suggesting that it is degraded by autophagy and accordingly, accumulates in autophagosome structures. This is not the case for the other variants of SERPINA1 and A2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

Although our results suggest an overall conserved evolution as indicated by the Ï value below one (0.34), the higher likelihood obtained for all tree branches (free-ratio model) suggest that different lineages might have experienced different evolutionary rates [<italic>branch</italic>-model (M0â free): â2Îlâ=â167.39; P&lt;0.001).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we perform a comparative analysis for <italic>SERPINA2</italic> and <italic>A1</italic>, which share the highest level of sequence identity amongst genes of the 14q32.1 <italic>SERPIN</italic> cluster, and were thought to represent an inactivated duplicate and its functional gene, respectively. We cloned and sequenced three major full transcripts of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> differing at 308 and 320 codon positions and confirmed the gene organization in four coding exons, as initially predicted from alignments with <italic>SERPINA1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0066889-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, we provide the first <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the translation of SERPINA2 into a stable protein, modified by the addition of N-linked glycosyl side chains, with a molecular weight of â¼52 kDa (without V5-tag) compatible with a regular SERPIN.</p>
      <p>However, in contrast to SERPINA1, which is processed into a mature protein (â¼55 kDa) by the Golgi apparatus to include complex side chains resistant to Endo H, SERPINA2 is only partially glycosylated and sensitive to Endo H, suggesting a subcellular localization in the ER. Indeed, the reticular pattern observed for SERPINA2, the subcellular fractionation into the membranous fraction, and the co-localization with CANX and PDIA3, two chaperones involved in the ER quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins provided additional support for SERPINA2 localization in this organelle. Moreover, SERPINA2 is absent in the extracellular media, suggesting that its localization to the ER is complete, in contrast to S and Z alleles of SERPINA1, which are partially secreted despite their abnormal accumulation in the ER due to misfolding.</p>
      <p>CANX has a more prolonged association to misfolded proteins entering in the ERAD pathway and has been implicated in the degradation of Z variant <xref rid="pone.0066889-Chevet1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Granell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our models, only a minor fraction of the recombinant proteins Z and S, and SERPINA2, associate with CANX as revealed by PLA, and no significant difference is observed among variants or between SERPINA1 and A2. Only M1 does not bind to CANX. This shows that all variants are in close proximity (maximum 30â40 nm) to CANX, supposedly as a result of protein-protein interaction. In the case of the misfolded Z variant of SERPINA1, dissociation from CAXN is essential for its rapid degradation by the proteasome, and prolonged interactions may imply an impaired function of the ER <xref rid="pone.0066889-Granell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, providing an alternative justification for the lack of distinction between SERPINs.</p>
      <p>The PDIA3 chaperone catalyses the biochemical reactions of proteins entering in the CANX cycle and is recruited by unfolded proteins in aggregates <xref rid="pone.0066889-Erickson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Jessop1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, presenting a stronger association with SERPINs than CANX. These results are in agreement with the previous findings on Z transgenic mice in which a protein-disulfide isomerase (P4hb or Pdi) exhibited a more permanent association to Z, probably favoring protein unfolding and delivery to the proteasome pathway <xref rid="pone.0066889-Papp1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Importantly, P4HB was found to co-localize with Z in the ER and in the inclusion bodies <xref rid="pone.0066889-Granell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and contrary to CANX, the overexpression of P4HB and PDIA3 did not affect ER trafficking or degradation of misfolded SERPINs <xref rid="pone.0066889-Granell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Hosokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Proteasome inhibition with ALLN in SERPINA2 cell lines contrasts with the features of SERPINA1 variants, significantly degraded by this proteolytic pathway. SERPINA2 variants present residual levels of proteasome-dependent degradation, comparable to the M1 variant of SERPINA1. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the degradation of SERPINA2 could be attributed to abnormal protein folding. We hypothesized that other proteolytic pathways could contribute on the regulation of SERPINA2, such as autophagy, similarly to that described for Z variant <xref rid="pone.0066889-Teckman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Cabral1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Granell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Kamimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Granell2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, in our models, the inhibition of authophagy by 3MA was found to result in the accumulation of Z in autophagosome-like structures, but this was not observed for S and SERPINA2 variants.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the identification of insoluble fractions for S and Z but not for SERPINA2, which was only present in the soluble fraction, suggests that SERPINA2 may be a non-polymerogenic SERPIN. Our results suggest that SERPINA2 resides in the ER without being misfolded, as shown by the insensitivity to proteasome or autophagy inhibition. Interestingly, other SERPINs have been shown to reside and participate in chaperone-assembly at the ER. For example SERPINH1, also known as HSP47, is an ER-resident molecule enrolled in the biosynthesis of collagen, that interacts with different ER chaperones possibly through a large protein complex <xref rid="pone.0066889-Christiansen1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Mala1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. For the case of SERPINA2, our results show that it interacts directly with CAXN and PDIA3, either as a substrate or as a co-chaperone. Despite the absence of the RDEL (SERPINH1) or the KDEL C-terminal motif that provides an ER anchor, SERPINA2 is predicted by WoLF PSORT program <xref rid="pone.0066889-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> to have ER localization (14/32 neighbors). The fact that the extracellular prediction (10/32 neighbors) might be strongly influenced by common domains of clade A SERPINs (7 of the 10 neighbors), indicates that the ER localization of SERPINA2 is likely, and suggests the presence of unknown ER motifs in this protein.</p>
      <p>Temperature increments have been widely proposed to favor Z polymerization <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0066889-Lomas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Janciauskiene2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In our models, heat stress had a minor impact in SERPINA2 and a higher effect in SERPINA1, as seen by the levels of recombinant proteins found in insoluble fractions. In contrast, SERPINA2 showed only a slight increase in its expression reinforcing the hypothesis of a divergent activity from SERPINA1.</p>
      <p>The phylogenetic analysis of <italic>SERPINA1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> sequences placed the duplication event of these genes in the crown of Primate group, about 92.7 million years ago <xref rid="pone.0066889-Hedges1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The lines of evidence provided by our phylogenetic analysis are consistent with a constrained evolution of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> and <italic>A1</italic> in primates (<italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> &lt;1), thereby sustaining the hypothesis of <italic>SERPINA2</italic> being an active gene, expressed in a large set of tissues and coding for a stable SERPIN. Nonetheless, the finding of a higher evolutionary rate in <italic>SERPINA2</italic> ancestral branch (AA2) and the evidence for several amino acid substitutions being evolving under positive selection, support the hypothesis of the emergence of a new advantageous function after duplication. These substitutions include the M358W in the reactive site, and the L241A and M242Q in the second strand from B Î²-sheets (s2B). In <italic>in vitro</italic> assays carried out in a SERPINA1 scaffold, the M358W substitution was shown to slower the formation of protease-inhibitor complexes and to change the inhibitory affinity towards chymotrypsin <xref rid="pone.0066889-Futamura1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. On the other hand, in the three-dimensional models of SERPINA1 the L241A and M242Q substitutions are predicted to create a cavity and to reduce hydrophobicity at buried sites of the protein, respectively. Moreover, these sites are expected to pack against W194 and F198, two conserved residues among the entire SERPIN superfamily <xref rid="pone.0066889-Irving1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In close proximity to the aforementioned residues there are two other substitutions (R196D and P197K) inferred as targets of positive selection in SERPINA2. Interestingly, all these residues lie in a key region of SERPINâs structure â the breach, in which significant changes in composition were shown to affect the âstressedâ to ârelaxedâ transition and to increase protein stability with a concomitant decrease in the inhibitory activity <xref rid="pone.0066889-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0066889-Seixas2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Considering the potential effects of the amino acid substitutions favored by selection, we propose that SERPINA2 has evolved toward a different protease affinity and an altered plasticity. The most recent advances in the understanding of SERPIN misfolding indicate the swapping of the protein C-terminus region into a B Î²-sheet gap of another molecule (s4B and s5B) as the underlying cause for the pathological polymerization of the Z allele in vivo <xref rid="pone.0066889-Yamasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066889-Yamasaki2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The finding of a reduced susceptibility to polymerization by SERPINA2 might suggest a significant impact of selected residues in maintaining a more stable conformation and a structure less prone to C-terminus swapping.</p>
      <p>In summary, herein we provide the first <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in vivo,</italic> and phylogenetic evidences for <italic>SERPINA2</italic> as an active gene and not genomic redundant. We show that SERPINA2 is an intracellular glycoprotein with an ER localization that cannot be associated to protein polymerization or misfolding. Moreover, we demonstrated that <italic>SERPINA2</italic> has undergone an accelerated divergence from <italic>SERPINA1</italic>, which contributed to the acquisition of a new activity, possibly as a chymotrypsin-like SERPIN conserved in most present-day primates.</p>

Cells were seeded on 6-well plates, and treated for 18 hours with ALLN (50 Âµg/mL), or for 24 hours with 3MA (10 ÂµM).</p>

<italic>SERPINA2</italic> and <italic>A1</italic> cDNA sequences were retrieved from available databases or obtained by direct sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0066889.s010">Table S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of the 29 vertebrate sequences were performed using ML in PAUP* v4.0b10 and BI in MrBayes 3.2 <xref rid="pone.0066889-Ronquist1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Heuristic searches were run with ML as optimality criterion. The starting tree was obtained via stepwise addition, with 100 replicates of random addition of sequences. Tree-bisection-reconnection was used as the branch-swapping algorithm. The models of evolution implemented in the ML analyses were obtained with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) implemented in jModelTest 0.1.1 <xref rid="pone.0066889-Posada1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. To test the robustness of the trees 1000 bootstrap replicates were run. Bayesian analyses were run using the model of evolution determined with jModelTest, and parameters were incorporated as priors in the form of dirichlet distributions. Two independent runs of 1Ã10<sup>6</sup> generations with four chains each (1 cold and 3 heated chains) were set up. Trees were sampled every 100<sup>th</sup> generation and the first 2500 trees were discarded as âburn-inâ. The remaining trees were used to compute the Bayesian posterior probabilities of each clade of the consensus tree. <italic>Serpina1</italic> sequences of <italic>Gallus</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> were used as outgroups.</p>
        <p>Maximum likelihoods estimates of <italic>d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub></italic> (<italic>Ï</italic>), where <italic>d<sub>S</sub></italic> and <italic>d<sub>N</sub></italic> correspond to synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates respectively, were carried out using the <italic>codeml</italic> program from the software package Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood - PAML version 4.2 <xref rid="pone.0066889-Yang3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Likelihood-ratio tests (LRT) were performed using either the entire phylogeny or the primate clades as inputs. These included the <italic>branch</italic> model, which compares a single Ï value obtained for all lineages (M0) with a model assuming different Ï values for each lineage or branch (free-ratio) <xref rid="pone.0066889-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The values of Ï &gt;1 were considered as evidences of positive selection and the values of Ï &lt;1 were regarded as an indication of purifying selection. The significance of each nested model was obtained from twice the variation of likelihoods (2Îl) using a Ï<sup>2</sup> statistic. To evaluate whether the duplication event leading to <italic>SERPINA2</italic> could have been associated with a diversifying process, we performed the <italic>branch-site</italic> model for the primate clade including <italic>SERPINA2</italic> and <italic>A1</italic>.
