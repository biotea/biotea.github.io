        <p id="P2">Pheochromocytomas, catecholamine-secreting tumors of neural crest origin, are frequently hereditary<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. However, the molecular basis for the majority of these tumors is unknown<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. We identified the transmembrane-encoding <italic>TMEM127</italic> gene, on chromosome 2q11, as a novel pheochromocytoma susceptibility gene. In a cohort of 103 samples, truncating germline <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutations were detected in one-third of familial and about 3% of sporadic-appearing tumors without a known genetic cause. The wild-type allele was consistently deleted in tumor DNA, suggesting a two-hit mechanism of inactivation. Pheochromocytomas with <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutations are transcriptionally related to <italic>NF1</italic>-mutant tumors and, similarly, show hyperphosphorylation of mTOR targets. Accordingly, in vitro gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicate that TMEM127 is a negative regulator of mTOR. TMEM127 dynamically associates with the endomembrane system and colocalizes with perinuclear (activated) mTOR, suggesting a subcompartmental-specific effect. Our studies unveil <italic>TMEM127</italic> as a novel tumor suppressor gene and validate the power of hereditary tumors for elucidating cancer pathogenesis.</p>

    <p id="P3">Using an integrative genomics strategy that involved linkage analysis, global expression profiling and high-density copy number mapping, we previously defined a novel pheochromocytoma susceptibility locus to chromosome 2q11, which we named FP (<underline>F</underline>amilial <underline>P</underline>heochromocytoma)<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Identification of other affected individuals in the original kindred established a dominant model of transmission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) and additional linked families redefined the limits of the FP locus to a region containing 205 genes (NCBI Build 35.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>) spanning 19.62Mb between 94,81Mbp and 114,43Mbp. Tumor DNA from one of the affected cases (index case of Family 1) was used as a template for exon-based sequencing, as described<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Using this approach, we identified a splice-site variant (IVS3-2A&gt;C) in the provisional transmembrane-encoding gene, <italic>TMEM127</italic>, also known as <italic>FLJ20507</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>). This mutation was also present in this patientâs germline DNA as well as in each of six other affected siblings, but not in samples from two unaffected sibs.</p>
    <p id="P4">We next sequenced germline and/or tumor DNA from an additional 102 index pheochromocytomas, 19 of which had a clear familial history, and 83 were apparently sporadic cases. We detected six additional <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutations in these samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2C</xref>). Six of the seven <italic>TMEM127</italic> variants identified were splice-site or nonsense mutations predicted to interrupt prematurely the protein reading frame (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig.2A and B</xref>). In all, four <italic>TMEM127</italic> variants (including the index case) were detected among 12 families without mutations in other pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.2A and B</xref>). The remaining three mutations were identified among the âsporadicâ samples that were also wild-type for the known pheochromocytoma-related genes. One of the patients was adopted and thus heredity status was unknown (patient 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>), and the other two individuals reported no family history of pheochromocytoma (patients 4 and 7, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In all cases, mutations were detected in the corresponding germline DNA and, when available, in DNA from other relatives with pheochromocytoma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). One of the identified mutations, IVS3-2A&gt;C, was detected in two separate families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, families 1 and 5). Haplotype analysis of tumor DNA excluded a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 3</xref>). None of the sequence changes found in the pheochromocytoma samples were identified in a control group of 1064 ethnically-matched alleles, although novel and known polymorphic variants were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 4</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the <italic>TMEM127</italic> locus was examined in 35 pheochromocytomas: all <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant tumors tested (n=19, including multiple affected individuals from the same family or bilateral tumors) had LOH, in contrast with only 2 of 16 wild-type <italic>TMEM127</italic> samples (P=5.17e-8, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 5</xref>). In each mutant <italic>TMEM127</italic> pheochromocytoma, the wild-type allele was lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig.2A</xref>), in agreement with a two-hit model of tumor suppressor inactivation. The only missense mutation (V90M) in this series targeted an amino acid conserved amongst putative mammalian <italic>TMEM127</italic> orthologs. As only germline DNA was available from this sample, LOH status could not be determined.</p>
    <p id="P6">We next measured <italic>TMEM127</italic> transcription in pheochromocytomas and found a 4-fold decrease in expression levels of <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant samples (n=7) compared to 16 non-mutated pheochromocytomas of various genetic backgrounds (P=0.002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Fig. 2D</xref>). This degree of downregulation suggests instability of the mutant transcript, rather than low expression simply due to loss of one allele. RNA was unavailable from the two tumors that had LOH at 2q11 but no <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutation.</p>
    <p id="P7">Clinically, patients with <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutations developed pheochromocytomas on average at 45.3 years of age, similar to the mean age at diagnosis of sporadic pheochromocytomas (43.6-43.9y<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) but notably older than syndromic cases (24.9-30.2y<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). All tumors arose from the adrenal medulla and were bilateral in approximately half of the patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). No malignancies, defined by the presence of metastasis in nonchromaffin-derived tissues, or recurrences, were detected during follow-up of the affected cases (4 to 16 years). Four mutation carriers from Family 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) remain without clinical disease at 43 to 58 years of age, but a clear picture of the actual penetrance and phenotypic spectrum of <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutations awaits larger studies. Taken together, the data above suggest that <italic>TMEM127</italic> gene mutations are associated with pheochromocytoma predisposition and that <italic>TMEM127</italic> has features of a classic tumor suppressor gene.</p>
    <p id="P8">The <italic>TMEM127</italic> gene is predicted to encode a protein with three transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2C</xref>) and no clearly recognizable functional domains. Its sequence is highly conserved throughout evolution and putative orthologs can be identified from mammals to fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref>). The human gene is broadly expressed both in normal tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3B</xref>) and in a diverse panel of cancer cell lines<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3C</xref>), with variable transcription levels that may reflect tissue of origin. Likewise, its putative mouse ortholog is widely expressed from an early postnatal age through adulthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">To begin to probe the functional consequences of <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutations, we generated wild-type and mutant constructs tagged with Flag (either at the N- or C-terminus of the protein) or HA (N-terminus) epitopes. A single product of approximately 26KDa was recognized in HEK293 cells transfected with the wild-type constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A, 1B</xref>). However, we were unable to detect a translation product from the mutant constructs in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>), despite equivalent transfection efficiencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig.4A</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant proteins are not expressed, in support of a loss-of-function effect of these variants. Using confocal microscopy, we found that TMEM127 localizes to the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm, displaying both a punctate pattern and as perinuclear clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>). Colocalization studies showed that TMEM127 associates with a subpopulation of vesicular organelles corresponding to early endosomal structures labeled by Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), the Golgi, labeled both with syntaxin 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>) and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig.5A</xref>) and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5B</xref>). We further found that association of TMEM127 with the plasma membrane is enhanced by inhibition of endocytosis<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>), while increasing pH in the culture media partially traps TMEM127 in endosomal structures<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>). These findings suggest that TMEM127 associates dynamically with endosomes and may participate in protein trafficking between the plasma membrane, the Golgi and lysosomes.</p>
    <p id="P10">We used microarray-based expression profiling to define the transcription signature of <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant tumors.

In this sample set we confirmed the cluster association between the <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant tumors and pheochromocytomas with <italic>NF1</italic> and <italic>RET</italic> mutations, suggested by our earlier study of FP-linked tumors <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, used to identify pathways associated with the <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant tumor signature, revealed high statistical association with kinase receptor signals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

This pattern differed from the expression profiles of pheochromocytomas with mutations in <italic>VHL, SDHB</italic> or <italic>SDHD</italic> genes, which were uniquely enriched for transcripts involved in the response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

    <p id="P11">To further evaluate these findings, we knocked down <italic>TMEM127</italic> expression by short interfering (si) or short hairpin (sh) RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 6C</xref>). In agreement with the GSEA analysis, HIF1Î± and its targets were not induced by <italic>TMEM127</italic> downregulation in HEK293 or Hela cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

To explore the putative functional relationship with <italic>NF1</italic>-mutant tumors, we began by examining RAS activation, the hallmark of <italic>NF1</italic> loss<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. <italic>TMEM127</italic> depletion by two distinct shRNA sequences did not increase RAS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Likewise, AKT phosphorylation, a surrogate for PI3K activity which is enhanced by both <italic>NF1</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and <italic>RET</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> mutations, was not increased after TMEM127 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7A</xref>). Deregulation of mTOR, a target of several kinase receptor pathways<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, is also a feature of <italic>NF1</italic> loss<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. This fact, combined with the kinase receptor signature displayed by <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant tumors<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, prompted us to investigate the effects of TMEM127 on mTOR signaling.</p>
    <p id="P12">mTOR operates as two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. mTORC1 promotes cell growth and protein translation, and phosphorylates 4EBP1 and S6K. The cellular role of mTORC2 is less clear and its best known substrate is AKT<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. As shown above, TMEM127 knockdown did not impact on AKT activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Likewise, enforced expression of TMEM127 did not change AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that mTORC2 is not involved in this signal. In contrast, TMEM127 knockdown led to increased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in various cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>). These effects were observed by distinct TMEM127 shRNA target sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>) and were independent of serum in HEK293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>) and A2058 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref>). Conversely, enforced expression of TMEM127 using independent constructs led to reduced mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7C</xref>). Consistent with the observation that mTORC1 is a critical regulator of cell growth and size in many species<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, we found that TMEM127 knockdown cells were larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig.7D</xref>) and proliferated at increased rates compared to control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig.7E</xref>), while cell proliferation was reduced in cells overexpressing TMEM127 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 7F</xref>). To determine the relevance of these findings in primary tumors, we examined lysates from <italic>TMEM127</italic>-mutant pheochromocytomas and found increased phosphorylation of S6K compared to normal adrenal medulla or tumors without a <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3H</xref>). In agreement with the reported effects of NF1 towards mTOR<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, one <italic>NF1</italic>-mutant pheochromocytoma showed elevated S6K phosphorylation, comparable to tumors with a <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutation. Collectively, these results suggest that TMEM127 contributes to control mTORC1 signals and support a role for TMEM127 as a tumor suppressor.</p>
    <p id="P13">To further determine the extent to which TMEM127 influences mTOR regulation, we tested the effect of amino acids, powerful modulators of mTOR activity that supersede the actions of other regulators of this pathway<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Two independent <italic>TMEM127</italic>-specific shRNA sequences increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target S6K in 293E cells, both in amino acid-starved and rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In agreement with these findings, overexpression of TMEM127 decreased phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets after amino-acid repletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 7G</xref>). To further characterize the interplay between mTOR and TMEM127, we co-expressed myc-mTOR and HA-TMEM127 in HEK293T cells and examined their localization by confocal microscopy. In the absence of amino acid, myc-mTOR, like endogenous mTOR, localized diffusely within the cytoplasm but upon amino acid exposure, it became clustered to the perinuclear region of the cell(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>), a required step for its activation by Rheb1<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. We found that TMEM127 localized to the same cellular compartment as that of amino acid-activated mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the extent of myc-mTOR perinuclear localization after amino acid stimulation was significantly more pronounced in cells co-expressing TMEM127 than in control cells not overexpressing this gene (93.4Â±12%, <italic>vs</italic>. 64.3Â±12% respectively, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref>). This finding suggests that the effects of TMEM127 toward mTOR may be compartment-specific and influence mTOR subcellular localization.</p>
    <p id="P14">In summary, we identified a novel tumor suppressor gene that is associated with pheochromocytoma development. Similar to other genetic mutations reported in these tumors, all <italic>TMEM127</italic> gene variants were present in the germline<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Our results suggest that TMEM127 limits mTORC1 activation and that it occupies the same intracellular domain as active mTOR. Interestingly, a component of the <italic>trans</italic>Golgi network that shuttles between the plasma membrane and the endomembrane system has recently been implicated in cancer by modulating mTOR signals<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Taken together with other recent evidence<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, our data give further support to an emerging role of the endomembrane and vacuolar network in mTOR regulation and in cancer. Future studies using in vivo models should determine whether mTOR activation is sufficient to explain the tumor phenotype resulting from <italic>TMEM127</italic> mutation. Finally, our results support the notion that disruptions of TMEM127 could be the underlying basis for tumors with an aberrant mTOR pathway and validate the power of hereditary tumor models to shed light on cell growth-related signals.</p>

TMEM127 immunoreactivity determined by Flag or HA (red) is present both at the plasma membrane (illustrated on the left panel) and cytoplasm, with punctate (middle and right panels) or perinuclear (right panel, arrows) signals, but is absent from the nucleus (DAPI, blue). These distinct staining patterns were observed with the various constructs in at least three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>). Plasma membrane-associated TMEM127 distribution was detected on average in 38% (Â±13%, n=200) of cells under regular culture conditions. A similar variance in the percentage of plasma membrane associated-signal was noted for each of the constructs.</p>

        <p>Confocal images of HA-TMEM127-transfected HEK293E cells fixed and immunofluorescently labeled with either the early endosome marker Rab5 antibody [red, <bold>(A)</bold>] or the Golgi marker syntaxin 6 [red, <bold>(B)</bold>, HA antibody (green) and DAPI (blue)]. Regions identified by the white-dashed rectangles are presented at higher magnification in the right and lower panels. Middle panels: separate presentations of the red and green channel images. Lower panels: overlap (yellow) of red and green pixels, irrespective of their intensity. Right image panel presents intensity values of the product of the difference of the means (PDMs). Positive PDMs identify pixels where intensities in the red and green channels vary in synchrony. Perfectly synchronous signals would be indicated with a PDM value of 1. Completely asynchronous signals would have a value of â1. The PDM intensity scale ranges from the minimum to maximum values within each image panel, â0.5 to 0.5 in <bold>A</bold> and â0.6 to 0.6 in <bold>B.</bold> Optical sections are ~0.4 Î¼m thick. Bars are 2 Î¼m. These results were representative of multiple cells assessed in independent experiments. <bold>C)</bold> HEK293E cells stably transfected with HA-TMEM127 were left untreated (top) or were cultured in the presence of a potassium-depleting buffer (bottom), as described in Methods. Cells were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for HA (green) or, Rab5 (red) before imaging. DAPI (blue) represents nuclei. An increase in plasma-membrane associated TMEM127 and control Rab5 is seen after inhibition of endocytosis promoted by this treatment. Bars are 10Î¼m. <bold>D)</bold> HEK293E cells stably transfected with HA-TMEM127 were left untreated (top) or were exposed to 50mM ammonium chloride (bottom) for 2 h. Cells were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for HA (green) or Rab5 (red) before imaging. DAPI (blue) represents nuclei. Expansion of endosomal structures is seen both for HA-TMEM127 and Rab5. Bars are 5Î¼m.</p>
