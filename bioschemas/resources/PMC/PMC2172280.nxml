        <p>We identified primary cilia and centrosomes in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by antibodies to acetyl-Î±-tubulin and capillary morphogenesis gene-1 product (CMG-1), a human homologue of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein IFT-71 in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. CMG-1 was present in particles along primary cilia of HUVEC at interphase and around the oldest basal body/centriole at interphase and mitosis. To study the response of primary cilia and centrosomes to mechanical stimuli, we exposed cultured HUVEC to laminar shear stress (LSS). Under LSS, all primary cilia disassembled, and centrosomes were deprived of CMG-1. We conclude that the exposure to LSS ends the IFT in cultured endothelial cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>We identified capillary morphogenesis gene-1 product (CMG-1) as the human homologue of IFT-71, a complex B protein supporting intraflagellar transport (IFT) in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>). The antibodies against CMG-1 allowed us to detect primary cilia in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and find conditions eliciting the disassembly of these cilia.</p>
      <p>Factors determining assembly and disassembly of primary cilia are unknown. Primary cilia respond to chemical and physical stimuli (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Pazour and Witman, 2003</xref>) and regulate tissue morphogenesis in vertebrates (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). They are composed of 3â30-Î¼m-long, 9+0 axonemes stemming from the oldest centrioles of interphase cells from all tissues listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://members.global2000.net/bowser/cilialist.html">http://members.global2000.net/bowser/cilialist.html</ext-link>. They disassemble at mitosis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wheatley et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>The IFT is required for assembly and maintenance of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella and occurs in cilia and flagella regardless of their motility or differentiation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). The IFT machinery is composed of kinesin II (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Piperno et al., 1996</xref>), cytoplasmic dynein (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 1999a</xref>), and protein complexes (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Piperno and Mead, 1997</xref>), referred to as IFT complex A and IFT complex B (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>CMG-1 could be induced in HUVEC during vasculogenesis but was not located in any cellular compartment or identified as an IFT component<italic>. CMG-1</italic> was previously cloned from a differential display cDNA library generated from HUVEC at different stages of capillary morphogenesis in vitro (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Primary cilia were not detected in endothelial cells in culture (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wheatley et al., 1996</xref>) but could be expressed in these cells for the following reasons. Primary cilia were observed in human aorta by electron microscopy (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bystrevskaya et al., 1992</xref>). Furthermore, polycystin-1 (PKD-1), a membrane protein mutated in polycystic kidney disease, is concentrated in primary cilia of various cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Barr et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Yoder et al., 2002</xref>), including kidney cells. Finally, mutations in PKD-1 affect the formation of capillaries in <italic>pkd-1</italic> mice (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>To identify a component of the IFT machinery in human, we initially analyzed the gene encoding <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> IFT-71. We used amino acid sequences of seven peptides (sequences surrounded by lines in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A) from the most abundant isoform of IFT-71 (see arrow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A') for the identification of a full-length cDNA clone. The IFT-71 cDNA encodes a protein with molecular weight 71,540 D and isoelectric point 8.98 in agreement with the migration of IFT-71 in two-dimensional PAGE (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Piperno et al., 1998</xref>). The nucleotide sequence of <italic>IFT-71</italic> is single copy, contains nine introns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), and likely expresses only one IFT-71 RNA, as assessed by Northern blot (not depicted). Therefore, the six isoforms of IFT-71 that were identified by a monoclonal antibody to IFT-71 (IFT-71ab) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A') are likely products of posttranslational modification.</p>

      <p>To confirm the identification of IFT-71 as an IFT protein in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, we prepared a polyclonal antibody to his-tagged IFT-71 (hisIFT-71Ab) and used the antibody to analyze flagellar extracts and whole cells. The sedimentation profile of IFT-71 from a <sup>35</sup>S-labeled flagellar extract, as revealed by Western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B'), coincided with the sedimentation peak of IFT complex A and complex B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Immunofluorescence by hisIFT-71Ab in cells exposed at the permissive temperature of 21Â°C was barely detectable along flagella of wild type and <italic>fla10-1,</italic> a thermosensitive mutant of anterograde IFT (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C</xref>' and D', respectively). In contrast, hisIFT-71Ab was concentrated in bulges along flagella of <italic>fla15</italic> and <italic>dhc1b</italic>, temperature-sensitive mutants of retrograde IFT (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Piperno et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E</xref>' and F'). In addition, hisIFT-71Ab was concentrated around the basal bodies of each of the four strains, wild type, <italic>fla10-1</italic>, <italic>fla15</italic>, and <italic>dhc1b</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C', D', E', and F'). Similar phenotypes of wild type, <italic>fla10-1</italic>, and <italic>fla15</italic> were observed previously with antibodies to other subunits of the IFT machinery (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>IFT-71 is similar (NCBI, BLAST: 22% identical and 43% positive, E = 1e<sup>â16</sup>) to a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> predicted protein C18H9.8, henceforth referred to as Ce-IFT-71. It is also similar (24% identical and 49% positive, E = 2e<sup>â36</sup>) to a human protein referred to as CMG-1 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, CMG-1 is nearly identical (87.8% identical and 94.0% positive) to the mouse protein Mm-CMG-1, which we assembled from two predicted proteins, BAC35365.1 and NP_080595.1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). These similarities extend throughout the full length of CMG-1, Ce-IFT-71, and Mm-CMG-1 proteins, and include long homology regions LHR-1 and LHR-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). These proteins have similar molecular weights and include several coiled-coil structures in similar positions, as predicted by SMART (not depicted).</p>
      <p>Ce-IFT-71 is most likely a component of the IFT machinery. A regulatory element of IFT complex B genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Swoboda et al., 2000</xref>) is present in a predicted intron of Ce-IFT-71 (Haycraft, C.J., personal communication). In contrast, the function and intracellular location of CMG-1 are unknown. Expression of a CMG-1âGFP chimera in HUVEC under control of an exogenous promoter failed to identify the intracellular location of CMG-1 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>To test the hypothesis that CMG-1 is a component of the IFT machinery, we tested whether CMG-1 is located in primary cilia. In turn, to identify primary cilia in HUVEC, we used a monoclonal antibody specific for acetyl-Î±-tubulin (AcTubab). Acetyl-Î±-tubulin is a major component of both primary cilia and centrioles (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Piperno et al., 1987</xref>). Every HUVEC at interphase contained acetylated microtubules located mainly around the centrosomal region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). In addition, 5â35% of HUVEC expressed a primary cilium that was distinguished as a 4â5-Î¼m rod containing the highest concentration of acetyl-Î±-tubulin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). HUVEC primary cilia occasionally were detectable by phase contrast (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> Bâ). HUVEC expressed the highest percentage of primary cilia at passages 2â6. In contrast, they lacked cilia at passages higher than 12.</p>

      <p>To identify the intracellular location of CMG-1, we prepared an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against his-tagged CMG-1 (hisCMG-1Ab). hisCMG-1Ab was present along all primary cilia of interphase HUVEC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, A', and Aâ) and generated a dotted staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B</xref>' and Bâ) similarly to the IFT components along <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>). hisCMG-1Ab was detected around one centriole in HUVEC presumably at G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B</xref>' and Bâ) and around two centrioles in HUVEC at S phase, when the distance between centrioles increases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C</xref>' and Câ) and centrioles duplicate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D' and Dâ). hisCMG-1Ab was concentrated around both spindle poles at mitosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E</xref>', Eâ, F', and Fâ).</p>
      <p>CMG-1, similar to IFT-71, was resolved in multiple isoforms in Western blots of proteins from HUVEC and mouse testes (unpublished data). Also it was part of 15â19S complexes from extracts of mouse testes (unpublished data).</p>
      <p>The evidence described above confirms the presence of primary cilia in endothelial cells and supports the hypothesis that CMG-1 is a component of the IFT. The structures stained by hisCMG-1Ab matched both location and morphology of the IFT machinery components in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> at interphase and mitosis (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Deane et al., 2001</xref>). IFT components at mitosis remain associated with the basal bodies/centrioles independently from the activity of IFT.</p>
      <p>To support the hypothesis that primary cilia of HUVEC respond to mechanical stimuli, we identified the location of PKD-1, a protein mediating mechanosensation in primary cilia of kidney cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Praetorius et al., 2003</xref>). We found PKD-1 concentrated in the centrosomal region of all HUVEC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A</xref> and A') and around both centrioles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A</xref> and A', insets) by an antibody specific for the COOH terminus of the protein (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>). PKD-1 also was located in primary cilia of &lt;10% of ciliated HUVEC, where it was found in particles along the cilia that resembled those stained by hisCMG-1Ab (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A</xref> and A', insets; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and B</xref>'). Therefore, PKD-1 elicits a response to mechanical stimuli only in a subset of the HUVEC expressing primary cilia if it functions as mechanosensor.</p>
      <p>To test the effects of mechanical stress on primary cilia, confluent HUVEC monolayers were subjected to laminar shear stress (LSS) in a flow chamber receiving a constant flow of medium for various times. Subsequently, HUVEC were scored for number of cilia and intracellular location of CMG-1. To ensure physiological relevance, a level of LSS of 15 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, similar to that generated in arterial circulation, was chosen.</p>
      <p>In a typical experiment, primary cilia of HUVEC under LSS were maintained for 1 h but totally disassembled in the following hour. On the other hand, CMG-1 became undetectable in the majority of primary cilia within 1 h and in the centrosomal region in the following hour (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). After 30-min and 1-h intervals, we detected CMG-1 along one primary cilium but not along a second cilium in HUVEC that were in the same microscopic fields (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, A', and Aâ). After 1 h, we often observed CMG-1 located only in the centrosomal region, although the primary cilium was still present (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B, B', and Bâ). After 2 h of LSS, primary cilia were disassembled and CMG-1 was undetectable in the centrosomal region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, C', and Câ). During this interval, the number and length of acetylated microtubules increased, and HUVEC oriented themselves in the direction of LSS with the centrosomal region often trailing from the leading edge of the cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, C', and Câ).</p>

      <p>These observations suggest that HUVEC respond to LSS with the termination of IFT and the disassembly of primary cilia. They also suggest that ciliary PKD-1 in HUVEC either was undetected in the majority of primary cilia or is not required for the disassembly of primary cilia.</p>
      <p>The disassembly of HUVEC primary cilia under LSS was similar in two aspects to the disassembly of flagella exposed at the restrictive temperature in <italic>fla</italic>, temperature-sensitive mutants of flagellar assembly in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. First, components of the IFT machinery became undetectable along the axoneme within 1 h of exposure. Second, the axonemes disassembled in the following hour (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Piperno and Mead, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Iomini et al., 2001</xref>). On the other hand, components of the IFT machinery remained associated with the basal bodies/centrioles of the <italic>fla</italic> at the restrictive temperature, whereas CMG-1, the putative IFT component of HUVEC primary cilia, became undetectable under LSS. Therefore, HUVEC oldest centrioles did not maintain or initiate the assembly of primary cilia under LSS.</p>
      <p>The disassembly of primary cilia of HUVEC under LSS was part of a major rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. It coincided with changes in the acetylation of microtubules and in the organization of microfilaments (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Wojciak-Stothard and Ridley, 2003</xref>). It was complete and not partial, as observed for primary cilia subjected to low temperature or trypsinization (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wheatley et al., 1996</xref>) or flagella under condition of chemical or mechanical stimulation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lefebvre and Rosenbaum, 1986</xref>).</p>
      <p>Membrane domains in direct contact with primary cilia or centrosomes may be sites for induction of specific signals that reorganize the cytoskeleton and cause a new orientation of HUVEC. If the expression of CMG-1 is increased during capillary morphogenesis in vitro (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al., 2001</xref>), primary cilia may also have an important role in vasculogenesis.</p>

        <title>Cloning of IFT-71 and CMG-1</title>
        <p>We cloned a 1,266-bp fragment of IFT-71 cDNA from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> by RT-PCR and used the fragment for the identification of full-length cDNA clones. We identified the partial-length cDNA clone by nucleotide sequences corresponding to six peptide sequences of the most abundant isoform of IFT-71. Peptide sequences of IFT-71 were obtained by mass spectrometry.</p>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from wild-type cells 30 min after deflagellation. Poly(A) RNA was purified with Oligo-kit (QIAGEN). Double-stranded cDNA was generated using Superscript Choice System Kit (Invitrogen). Degenerated primers 5â²-CAGGAGGCICTSGCIGACTACAACACIGTSCTSGACAAG-3â² and 5â²-CTTSAGGAACTCGTCCATCTCGAASACICCIGCISW-3â², where Y = C + T, R = A + G, W = A + T, S = G + C, and I = inosine, were designed from peptides QEALADYNTVLDK and SAGVFEMDEFL/IK, respectively, which were identified by mass spectrometry.</p>
        <p>The cDNA fragment was used to screen a deflagellation cDNA library (<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genetic center, project ID 1030). Out of the nine positives clones identified by Southern blot, two were sequenced. The open reading frames in these clones encoded a protein of 641 amino acids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ submission number of the cDNA sequence of IFT-71 is AY505143. The open reading frames of IFT-71 cDNA exactly matched the sequences corresponding to 10 predicted exons of <italic>IFT-71</italic>, as reported in the database of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome available at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/Chlamy">ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/Chlamy</ext-link>, see scaffold 246.</p>
        <p>Following the identification of <italic>IFT-71</italic>, a BLAST search of the GenBank/DMBL/DDBJ database showed that IFT-71 cDNA is almost identical to the entry AY245434 (intraflagellar transport protein component IFT74/72) submitted by others (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2004</xref>). However, the sequence reported in AY245434 diverged by 10 nucleotides in the coding region from the predicted exons of <italic>IFT-71</italic>. As a consequence, the translated protein differed by 10 amino acids from the sequence that we predicted.</p>
        <p>For Northern blot analysis, 3 Î¼g of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA was run on an agarose gel and transferred to Gene screen Plus hybridization membrane (NEN Life Science Products) following standard methods. Probes were labeled with <sup>32</sup>P using the random Prime-It Kit (Stratagene).</p>
        <p>CMG-1 clone CS0DF006YJ09 was obtained from Invitrogen. The cDNA coding regions of both IFT-71 and CMG-1 were cloned into a pQE-30 bacterial expression vector using the KpnI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5â² and 3â² ends, respectively, created by PCR.</p>

        <p>LSS was applied to HUVEC for times ranging from 30 min to 15 h using a parallel plate flow chamber set in a incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37Â°C. A peristaltic pump and a depulsator (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nonaka et al., 2002</xref>) delivered a constant flow of medium to the chamber to obtain 15 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>.

Wall shear stress Tw was calculated using the equation 3yQ/2a<sup>2</sup>b (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Houston et al., 1999</xref>), where y is viscosity (poise) of the medium at 37Â°C, Q is the volumetric flow rate (ml/s), a is the half channel height (cm), and b is the channel width (cm).</p>
