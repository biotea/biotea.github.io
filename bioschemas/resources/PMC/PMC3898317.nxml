      <abstract>
        <p>Understanding tumor-induced angiogenesis is a challenging problem with important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In this study, we define a novel function for epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) in the control of angiogenesis. EMP2 functions as an oncogene in endometrial cancer, and its expression has been linked to decreased survival. Using endometrial cancer xenografts, modulation of EMP2 expression resulted in profound changes to the tumor microvasculature. Under hypoxic conditions, upregulation of EMP2 promoted vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) expression through a HIF-1Î±-dependent pathway and resulted in successful capillary-like tube formation. In contrast, reduction of EMP2 correlated with reduced HIF-1Î± and VEGF expression with the net consequence of poorly vascularized tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have previously shown that targeting of EMP2 using diabodies in endometrial cancer resulted in a reduction of tumor load, and since then we have constructed a fully human EMP2 IgG1. Treatment of endometrial cancer cells with EMP2-IgG1 reduced tumor load with a significant improvement in survival. These results support the role of EMP2 in the control of the tumor microenvironment and confirm the cytotoxic effects observed by EMP2 treatment <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sprouting angiogenesisâthe process by which new blood vessels grow from existing onesâis a ubiquitous phenomenon in health and disease. It has a pivotal role in diverse processes from embryo development to wound healing to tumor growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Regarding tumor angiogenesis, it has been shown that solid tumor growth depends on successful neovascularization and several factors, the most notable being vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), have been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis. VEGFs were first described as a potent vascular permeability factor (VPF) secreted by tumor cells that stimulate a rapid and reversible increase in microvascular permeability without mast cell degranulation or endothelial cell damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Its importance in tumor biology has led to the development of several drugs, the most notable being the recently FDA-approved bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA)âa humanized anti-VEGF antibody, as anticancer agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>VEGF polypeptides belong to the PDGF family of growth factors, and are perhaps the most important players that regulate vessel formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> VEGFs are encoded by a family of genes that includes VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D and placental growth factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> They are dimeric cysteine-linked secreted glycoproteins with a molecular weight of â¼40âkDa. Produced in response to hypoxia, specific growth and differentiation factors, and by oncogenes, VEGFs are produced by many cell types, including tumor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> In tumors, VEGF-A appears to be most potent angiogenic of the vascular growth factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> and its secretion has been shown to be critical for tumor growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Thus, understanding the mechanisms that control angiogenesis, and in particular that control VEGF-A expression, are of paramount importance in tumor biology.</p>
      <p>Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) is a tetraspan protein of the GAS-3/PMP22 family. Concordant with the role of tetraspans, EMP2 is thought to curate molecules on the plasma membrane to regulate the activity of specific signaling complexes. EMP2 coordinates the activity of select integrin isoforms, coalescing in the activation of FAK and Src.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Recently, EMP2 has also been revealed as a novel oncogene upregulated in a number of tumors including endometrial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> ovarian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and gliomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Upregulation of EMP2 expression has been associated with tumor progression, invasion and poor patient prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To date, the mechanism of how changes in EMP2 levels affect the tumor microenvironment has not been evaluated. Using a model for endometrial cancer, we determined that an important function of EMP2 is as a regulator of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that increased EMP2 promotes endothelial cell tube formation through increased VEGF-A expression. Therapeutic targeting of EMP2 using monoclonal antibodies reduces tumor vasculature, identifying a novel mechanism of reducing tumor load through indirect control of VEGF-A.</p>

        <title>EMP2 IgG1 improves endometrial cancer survival</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that anti-EMP2 diabodies reduce tumor load in HEC1A xenografts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Since this original study, a recombinant EMP2 IgG1 antibody has been designed and shown to be therapeutically beneficial in mouse models of breast cancer (Fu and Wadehra, submitted). To determine the efficacy of EMP2 IgG1 for endometrial cancer, subcutaneous xenografts using the HEC1A/EMP2 cell line were created. Systemic weekly injections of EMP2 IgG1 reduced tumor load compared to control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This reduction in tumor load translated into a significant increase in survival for mice treated with EMP2 IgG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=0.02). Even after 84 days, surviving mice showed no measurable change in tumor size. Upon histologic examination, central necrosis was prominent in the tumors after anti-EMP2 antibody treatment compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Although this can be attributed partially to higher interstitial pressure and poorer blood flow at the center of tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> significantly less necrosis was visible in tumors with control IgG antibodies treatment. To analyze these alterations in tumor vasculature, immunostaining for vasculature was performed using <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> lectin on surviving clusters of tumor cells. Lectin immunostaining studies confirmed the marked loss of vessels during anti-EMP2 treatment in areas of viable tumor (1D).</p>
        <p>To further examine whether the reductions in tumor vascularity from EMP2 treatment were due to vessel regression or reduced angiogenesis, tumors were stained with Masson's trichrome to detect the presence of collagen sleeves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> in necrotic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). All treatment groups had scattered fragments of basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, arrowheads), but empty basement membrane sleeves were more abundant in areas of necrosis after the anti-EMP2 antibody than control treatments. This suggests that blockade of EMP2 is a novel mechanism to reduce tumor neovascularization.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Tumor-associated vasculature</title>
        <p>Recent studies have shown that EMP2 expression is upregulated in endometrial tumors and that its expression alters tumor cell development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Studies have also shown that modulation of EMP2 does not significantly alter tumor cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Therefore, we postulated that it may be an important regulator of the tumor cell microenvironment. To test this idea, tumors were created from endometrial cancer cells that overexpressed EMP2 (HEC1A/EMP2), expressed a vector control (HEC1A/V) or expressed a ribozyme to reduce its levels (HEC1A/RIBO). Masson's trichrome staining of xenografts suggested that EMP2 expression altered tumor vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). HEC1A/EMP2 tumors were highly vascularized, whereas tumors with reduced EMP2 (HEC1A/RIBO) levels formed small tumors with poor vasculature and large areas of necrosis.</p>
        <p>To confirm that EMP2 levels correlated with increased numbers of blood vessels, tumors were stained with <italic>L. esculentum</italic> lectin, which binds uniformly to the luminal surface of the endothelium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and DAPI. HEC1A/EMP2 tumors showed increased tumor-associated vasculature compared with the HEC1A/V tumors. Similar staining of HEC1A/RIBO tumors showed poor tumor vasculature with some background staining in the areas of necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Xenografts were also stained with CD34 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Concordantly, quantitation of staining revealed a significant correlation between EMP2 expression and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>

        <title>EMP2 expression promotes endothelial cell tube formation</title>
        <p>We used several approaches to investigate whether and how EMP2 could regulate the behavior of endothelial cells. Initially, the chemotactic response of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to supernatants from EMP2-modified cell lines was tested using Boyden chambers. Conditioned media was collected from cells grown under hypoxic conditions for up to 24âh. Conditioned media from cells that overexpressed EMP2 significantly enhanced directional migration compared to control cells (<italic>P</italic>=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Reduction in EMP2 expression further reduced cell migration by two-fold over control cells (<italic>P</italic>=0.03). To confirm that EMP2 expression altered endothelial cell migration, a âscratch' test was performed on a confluent monolayer of HUVEC cells. Concordant with the previous results, an EMP2 dose-dependent response was also observed using conditional medium from hypoxic HEC1A/EMP2, HEC1A/V or HEC1A/RIBO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). No statistically significant differences were observed from conditioned media collected from normoxic cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To determine whether EMP2 altered the functional behavior of endothelial cells, HUVEC cells were placed on a basement membrane matrix to induce capillary-like tube formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Cells were incubated in hypoxic cultured supernatants from HEC1A/EMP2, HEC1A/V and HEC1A/RIBO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). An EMP2-dependent response was observed in capillary-like tube formation, as HEC1A/EMP2 induced more tube formation and tubes with a greater diameter than HEC1A/V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d and e</xref>). Reduction in EMP2 expression in HEC1A cells further reduced the number of tubes formed compared with HEC1A/V, suggesting that EMP2 expression is necessary for endometrial tumor angiogenesis. This effect was also observed when EMP2 levels were reduced using shRNA, and although a similar trend in capillary-like tube formation was observed from normoxic cultured supernatants between HEC1A/EMP2 and HEC1A/V, these results were not statistically significant (data not shown). No significant difference in HUVEC cell proliferation was observed within the experimental window (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The reduction in vessel formation in HEC1A/RIBO and HEC1A/sh911 suggested that EMP2 in part regulated the tumor microenvironment via new blood vessel formation. In order to link anti-EMP2 treatment with changes in neovascularization, we initially treated HEC1A/EMP2 cells for 12â15âh under hypoxic conditions with anti-EMP2 IgG1 or control antibodies to determine their effect on capillary-like HUVEC tube formation, as no cellular toxicity was visible at this early time point. EMP2 IgG1 treatment was sufficient to reduce HUVEC tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine if the effects of EMP2 on endothelial cells are cell type specific, similar experiments were performed on primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Using supernatant from hypoxic HEC1A/EMP2, HEC1A/V or HEC1A/RIBO as a chemoattractant, Boyden chamber assays were performed on HAEC. Similar to results using HUVEC cultures, tumor expression of EMP2 promoted HAEC invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). These combined results suggest that EMP2 upregulation leads to an increase in proangiogenic events. Several cellular and molecular changes have been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> with the most potent inducer being VEGF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> In order to determine if VEGF contributed to HAEC invasion, tumor cell supernatants were incubated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF. Treatment with bevacizumab reduced HAEC migration to control levels, suggesting that EMP2 may regulate VEGF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>

        <title>EMP2 regulates VEGF expression</title>
        <p>In order to determine if EMP2 expression altered VEGF expression and secretion, cells were grown in normoxia or placed in a hypoxic chamber for 24âh. VEGF expression was below detection under normoxic conditions. However, when cells were placed in hypoxia, EMP2 expression directly correlated with total VEGF protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) as well as with secreted VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In contrast, reduction of EMP2 resulted in undetectable levels of VEGF by western blot and low levels of secreted protein. To confirm these results, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on hypoxic HEC1A/EMP2, HEC1A/V and HEC1A/RIBO cells. VEGF-A exists as multiple isoforms, which are generically referred to as VEGFxxx and result from the pre-mRNA alternative splicing of eight exons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Alternative splicing of VEGF-A was initially shown to generate four different isoforms with 121, 165, 189 and 206 amino acids (VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, VEGF206, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup>). EMP2 levels directly increased the mRNA expression of several VEGF isoforms (VEGF165 and VEGF121), whereas a reduction in EMP2 produced reduced VEGF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Low levels of VEGF189 mRNA was observed in HEC1A/EMP2 cells, and no expression of VEGF206 was detected in any of the cell lines.</p>
        <p>In the previous experiments, we demonstrated that downregulation of EMP2 in the tumor cell reduced capillary formation, and the motility of endothelial cells using coculture assays. This may be the result of reduced VEGF secretion by these cells or due to the expression of anti-angiogenic agents. To address this question, varying amounts of VEGF were added to the supernatants from vehicle control or cells with reduced EMP2 levels (HEC1A/RIBO or HEC1A/sh911). Exogenous VEGF was sufficient to induce HUVEC cell tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), suggesting that the absence of VEGF contributed to the lack of tube formation.</p>

        <title>EMP2 promotes HIF-1Î± expression through a Src-mediated pathway</title>
        <p>Several oncogenic as well as growth factor-driven pathways have been shown to regulate VEGF expression. As hypoxic conditions have been shown to trigger many oncogenic signaling pathways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> we initially investigated if the levels of EMP2 were sufficient to alter the expression of hypoxia-induced transcription factors (HIF), specifically HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î±. In all EMP2 HEC1A variants, no expression of HIF-2Î± was observed (data not shown). However, the expression of HIF-1Î± correlated with EMP2 expression. The highest levels of HIF-1Î± directly correlated with the highest concentration of EMP2 expression under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Reciprocally, HEC1A/RIBO cells produced below detection levels of HIF-1Î± under the same conditions. To confirm that lower levels of EMP2 reduce HIF-1Î± expression, shRNA constructs were generated to express a vehicle control or reduce EMP2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, right). Similar to the ribozyme, HEC1A/sh911 showed reduced HIF-1Î± expression compared to the vehicle control (HEC1A/shCtrl). To quantitate the difference in HIF-1Î± expression between the cell lines, blot intensities were analyzed using Image J. HEC1A/EMP2 cells significantly induced HIF-1Î± expression compared to HEC1A/V cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=0.0008). Reduction in EMP2 in HEC1A/RIBO, also showed a significant reduction in HIF-1Î± expression (<italic>P</italic>=0.02).</p>
        <p>HIF proteins have a number of important roles in cellular physiology that include the regulation of angiogenesis as well as metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> To determine if the regulation of HIF-1Î± expression by EMP2 is restricted to VEGF, proteins involved with glycolysis were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). EMP2 expression directly correlated with glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) expression, and significant differences were observed between HEC1A/EMP2 and HEC1A/sh911 (<italic>P</italic>=0.04). Whereas high EMP2 also appeared to slightly increase the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, no significant differences were observed between the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next focused on understanding the mechanism by which EMP2 regulated HIF-1Î± expression. As EMP2 has been shown to promote integrin-mediated FAK and Src activation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> the contribution of FAK/Src signaling to HIF-1Î± expression was determined. Using common inhibitors of AKT, PI3-kinase, EGFR and Src tyrosine kinases, HEC1A/EMP2 cells were treated with these agents while in a hypoxic chamber. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, EMP2-induced overexpression of HIF-1Î± was reversed using Src inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib, respectively. Both erlotinib and Ly294002, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, also produced a similar effect, suggesting an overlap in signaling with EMP2. In contrast, AKTi did not alter HIF-1Î± expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p>
        <p>To validate the effects of FAK signaling on HIF-1Î± expression, HEC1A/EMP2 and HEC1A/V cells were transiently transfected with scrambled or FAK siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). After 24âh in a hypoxic chamber, HIF-1Î± expression was determined. Reduction in FAK expression significantly diminished HIF-1Î± expression in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, right). A 68Â±3% reduction in FAK expression decreased HIF-1Î± expression by 48Â±3% in HEC1A/EMP2 cells. A similar reduction was observed in HEC1A/V cells where decreasing FAK expression by 51Â±5% produced an 82Â±8% drop in HIF-1Î± expression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>EMP2 is a novel oncogene upregulated in a number of cancers in women. In endometrial cancer, for example, EMP2 expression promotes endometrial cancer growth <italic>in vivo</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and to date, it is the only biomarker identified to predict endometrial cancer prognosis and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Given its expression profile and importance in disease pathogenesis, we previously generated a recombinant antibody fragment (diabody) to EMP2, and have shown that it induces necrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Since then, we have generated an EMP2 IgG1 with similar <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> properties (Fu and Wadehra, submitted), and have started to characterize its mechanism of action <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Using endometrial cancer cells, EMP2 IgG1 treatment significantly reduced tumor load with a net improvement in survival. Within tumors, significant necrosis was observed. To understand its mechanism of action, we generated cells with reduced EMP2 expression using ribozymes or specific shRNA constructs, which revealed a similar histology. In particular, severe necrosis was observed in tumors with reduced EMP2. Although we had previously observed increased cell death <italic>in vitro</italic> after exposure to antibodies that recognize EMP2, the necrotic response and the studies reported in this paper link EMP2 with control of VEGF expression through HIF-1Î±. Notably, HEC1A cells that were genetically modified for EMP2 expression showed a positive correlation between EMP2 levels and tumor vascularity. Cell supernatants from cells that were genetically modified for EMP2 expression showed a positive correlation between EMP2 levels, and endothelial cell migration and tube formation of two independent endothelial types under hypoxic conditions. Levels of VEGF and HIF-1Î± were concordant also with expression levels of EMP2, and blockade of EMP2 using an anti-EMP2 antibody showed a dose-dependent decrease in vascularization.</p>
      <p>Whereas additional investigations will be needed to identify how EMP2 controls HIF-1Î± expression, its effects do not appear to be limited to angiogenesis. As HIF-1 also regulates metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> the significant alteration in GLUT1 expression suggests that EMP2 upregulation may have an adaptive role in promoting and establishing endometrial cancer tumorigenesis.Whereas it is known that several oncogenes stimulate angiogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> all of the studies presented here point to a significant effect on HIF-1Î± and VEGF through control of EMP2 expression, and suggest the mechanism for the clinical association of high EMP2 expression with aggressive, more advanced tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Our results also suggest that EMP2 activates HIF-1Î± in a hypoxic environment through a FAK-Src-dependent mechanism. Although a similar trend in HUVEC migration and wound closure was observed under normoxic conditions, the differences were not statistically significant (data not shown). Under hypoxic conditions, the control of angiogenesis by EMP2 appears to be independent of AKT activation, suggesting that EMP2 and AKT regulate separate pathways. This is consistent with published reports that AKT signaling is neither required for HIF-1Î± expression nor stabilization under hypoxic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Although AKT inhibitors did not suppress EMP2 mediated HIF-1Î± activation, erlotinib and Ly294002, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, were sufficient to inhibit its expression. This is not unexpected as EGFR neutralizing antibodies have been shown to have potent antitumor cytotoxic-like effects <italic>in vivo</italic> (where angiogenesis is required) but not <italic>in vitro</italic> (where it is not).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> This would also suggest that in endometrial cancer cells, similar to what has been observed in other tumor models, EGFR stimulates HIF-1Î± activation via a PI3K-mediated but AKT independent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Is there overlap between EMP2 and EGFR signaling? We hypothesize that there is some overlap. Previous studies have shown that EMP2 promotes integrin expression and activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> As both integrins and EGFR can signal through MAP kinase activation, we predict this may be a common thread between the two pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The data presented here suggest that anti-EMP2 therapy in the disease has a combination of effects (direct toxicity and indirect regulation of VEGF) that supports its therapeutic potential. This is particularly important, given that the promise of anti-angiogenic agents has been incomplete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Initial clinical successes, prolonged overall and progression-free survival, using anti-VEGF antibody therapy in colorectal cancer prompted more widespread clinical use of these agents. However, these promising results were not replicated in multiple tumor types including metastatic breast cancer, resulting in withdrawal of FDA approval for its use in this tumor type. Indeed, some tumors escape VEGF inhibition through both hypoxia-dependent and hypoxia-independent manners. In addition, VEGF blockade may lead to proinflammatory molecules that might enhance tumor progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Could a similar effect be observed with longer anti-EMP2 treatment? Although our results are promising, additional investigations are required to further to define the long-term consequences of anti-EMP2 treatment.</p>

        <p>EMP2 promotes angiogenesis. (<bold>a</bold>) Chemotactic effects on the migration of HUVECs were measured using a standard Boyden chamber assay. HUVEC cells were stimulated to migrate in response to cultured media from hypoxic HEC1A/EMP2, HEC1A/V or HEC1A/RIBO cells. Experiments were repeated three times with data representing the meanÂ±s.e. (<bold>b</bold>) HUVEC cells' migration was measured using a âscratch' wound healing assay. Endothelial cells were cultured in hypoxic tumor cell supernatant, and wound closure was measured using microscopy. (<bold>c</bold>) HUVEC cells were plated on low growth factor matrigel in the presence of cultured media from hypoxic HEC1A/EMP2, HEC1A/V or HEC1A/RIBO cells. The experiment was repeated at least three times, and a representative image is shown. Capillary-like tube formation was quantitated by measuring the number of tubes (<bold>d</bold>), as well as the tube diameter (<bold>e</bold>). The data in the graph is the meanÂ±s.e.m. of the three fields using three independent experiments. (<bold>f</bold>) An equivalent number of HEC1A/EMP2 endometrial tumor cells were treated for 12âh under hypoxic conditions with varying concentrations of EMP2 IgG1 or control IgG. Supernatants were collected and added to HUVEC plated on low growth factor matrigel. Capillary tube formation was measured using phase contrast microscopy after 12â24âh.

        <p>EMP2 regulates VEGF expression. (<bold>a</bold>) A Boyden chamber assay was used to determine HAEC response to cultured hypoxic tumor cell supernatants. In some experiments, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, which binds soluble VEGF was added at 10âÎ¼g/ml to the cultured supernatant. (<bold>b</bold>) The expression of total VEGF was measured using western blot analysis on cells placed in a 0.5% hypoxic chamber for 24âh. EMP2 expression was verified in cell lines, where its expression was either upregulated as an EMP2-GFP fusion protein (45âkDa) or reduced using an EMP2-specific ribozyme; endogenous EMP2 is 18âkDa. <italic>Î²</italic>-actin was used as the loading control. (<bold>c</bold>) Secreted VEGF from hypoxic cells was measured using an ELISA. (<bold>d</bold>) Semi-quantitative expression of VEGFxxx mRNA was determined using RT-PCR on hypoxic tumor cells. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and a representative blot is shown. GAPDH expression serves as a loading control. (<bold>e</bold>) Exogenous VEGF was added to cultured media obtained from hypoxic HEC1A/RIBO or HEC1A/sh911 cells at 20 or 50âng/ml.
