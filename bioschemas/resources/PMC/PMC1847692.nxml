      <abstract>
        <p>It is generally believed that susceptibility to both organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases is under polygenic control. Although multiple genes have been implicated in each type of autoimmune disease, few are known to have a significant impact on both. Here, we investigated the significance of polymorphisms in the human gene <italic>CD24</italic> and the susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We used cases/control studies to determine the association between <italic>CD24</italic> polymorphism and the risk of MS and SLE. In addition, we also considered transmission disequilibrium tests using family data from two cohorts consisting of a total of 150 pedigrees of MS families and 187 pedigrees of SLE families. Our analyses revealed that a dinucleotide deletion at position 1527â¼1528 (P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic>) from the <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA translation start site is associated with a significantly reduced risk (odds ratio = 0.54 with 95% confidence interval = 0.34â0.82) and delayed progression (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0188) of MS. Among the SLE cohort, we found a similar reduction of risk with the same polymorphism (odds ratio = 0.38, confidence interval = 0.22â0.62). More importantly, using 150 pedigrees of MS families from two independent cohorts and the TRANSMIT software, we found that the P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele was preferentially transmitted to unaffected individuals (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Likewise, an analysis of 187 SLE families revealed the dinucleotide-deleted allele was preferentially transmitted to unaffected individuals (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). The mRNA levels for the dinucleotide-deletion allele were 2.5-fold less than that of the wild-type allele. The dinucleotide deletion significantly reduced the stability of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA. Our results demonstrate that a destabilizing dinucleotide deletion in the 3â² UTR of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA conveys significant protection against both MS and SLE.</p>

          <p>When an individual's immune system attacks self tissues or organs, he/she develops autoimmune diseases. Although it is well established that multiple genes control susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, most of the genes remain unidentified. In addition, although different autoimmune diseases have a common immunological basis, a very small number of genes have been identified that affect multiple autoimmune diseases. Here we show that a variation in <italic>CD24</italic> is a likely genetic factor for the risk and progression of two types of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), an organ-specific autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system, and systemic lupus erythematosus, a systemic autoimmune disease. Our data indicated that if an individual's <italic>CD24</italic> gene has a specific two-nucleotide deletion in the noncoding region of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA, his/her risk of developing MS or SLE is reduced by 2- to 3-fold. As a group, MS patients with the two-nucleotide deletion will likely have a slower disease progression. Biochemical analysis indicated that the deletion leads to rapid decay of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA, which should result in reduced synthesis of the CD24 protein. Our data may be useful for the treatment and diagnosis of autoimmune diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system of unknown etiology. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that MS is an autoimmune process modulated by both genetic and environmental factors [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An increased risk of MS among MS relatives has been found in numerous prospective epidemiological studies [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin has a 5- to 6-fold higher risk of MS than a dizygotic twin [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Collectively, these findings would implicate that, at least in part, the risk for developing this disorder and possibly its progression are mediated by multiple genetic factors. Several whole-genome screens were performed in MS affected families. These studies confirmed the association of MS with the <italic>HLA</italic> class II <italic>DR2</italic> haplotype <italic>(HLA-DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602),</italic> but failed to confirm other major putative loci in MS [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a classic systemic autoimmune disease with diverse clinical symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain and swelling, skin rashes, and chest pain. Severe SLE complications include nephritis, central nervous system vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and stroke. Whole-genome scans have revealed multiple chromosomal regions [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the identity of most susceptibility genes are unknown [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>CD24 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein with expression in a variety of cell types that can participate in the pathogenesis of MS and SLE, including activated T cells [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], B cells [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], macrophages [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and dendritic cells [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>CD24,</italic> as a candidate locus [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], was shown to be essential for the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, CD24 controls a checkpoint of EAE pathogenesis after the autoreactive T cells are produced [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently, we showed that CD24 is essential for local clonal expansion and persistence of T cells after their migration into the central nervous system and that expression of CD24 on either hematopoietic cells or nonhematopoietic antigen-presenting cells in the recipient is sufficient to confer susceptibility to EAE [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings suggest that CD24 is essential for susceptibility to EAE.</p>
      <p>Human <italic>CD24</italic> (CD24) mRNA has a 0.24-kb ORF and a 1.8-kb 3â² UTR. A CT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 170 from the <italic>CD24</italic> translation start site (P170) in the CD24 putative cleavage site for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (â1 position) [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] results in the nonconservative replacement of alanine with valine. The P170<italic><sup>TT</sup></italic> genotype expressed higher cell-surface CD24 than the P170<italic><sup>CT</sup></italic> or P170<italic><sup>CC</sup></italic> genotypes, which had an increased risk and more rapid progression of MS [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the CD24 SNP may influence MS pathogenesis by affecting the expression of CD24. The potential contribution of CD24 to SLE has not been studied. However, since CD24 has emerged as a major checkpoint of homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic hosts [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and since leucopenia is a defining feature of SLE [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it would be of great interest to evaluate whether CD24 polymorphism may affect susceptibility to SLE.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the long 3â² UTR of mouse <italic>Cd24</italic> mRNA plays an important role in controlling CD24 expression [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Two <italic>cis</italic> elements of mouse <italic>Cd24</italic> mRNA, a negative and a positive <italic>cis</italic> element, regulate the stability of mouse <italic>Cd24</italic> mRNA expression and determine cell-surface CD24 expression [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our sequencing analysis of the 3â² UTR of <italic>CD24</italic> revealed four polymorphisms in the Ohio population. Considering the importance of CD24 in the development and progression of MS, we investigated the association of the <italic>CD24</italic> polymorphisms at the 3â² UTR with the susceptibility to both organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases. Our study revealed a dinucleotide deletion in the 3â² UTR of human <italic>CD24</italic> that confers significant protection against the risk and progression of MS and the risk of SLE by destabilizing <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA.</p>

<italic>CD24</italic> Chromosomal Location and Polymorphisms in the 3â² UTR</title>
        <p>
<italic>CD24</italic> has been identified as an autosomal gene located in Chromosome 6q21 [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with intronless pseudogenes in Chromosomes 1, 15, and Y. In addition to a lack of introns, it has been reported that Chromosome Y DNA sequence differs from <italic>CD24</italic> cDNA at 23 positions, with two changes in the coding regions and the remaining ones scattered through the 1.6-kb cDNA region [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The <italic>CD24</italic> gene sequence, as assembled by Celera, is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. However, a recent update in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database placed <italic>CD24</italic> on Chromosome Y with partial intron 1 sequence and exon 2 identical to the cDNA except for eight changes in the region corresponding to the 3â² end of the cDNA. We used PCR primers antisense to a portion of the intronic sequence and the 3â² end of the <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA to amplify from genomic DNA, using as templates genomic DNA from eight unrelated normal individuals (four males and four females). Since the primers would amplify both the Chromosome 6 sequence and the putative Chromosome Y sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), we sequenced five clones from each of the eight individuals in order to determine which annotation is correct. We found that none of the 40 sequences matched the putative Chromosome Y sequence, regardless of the sex of the donor, and all sequences matched the intron 1 and exon 2 sequence of the <italic>CD24</italic> gene as located on Chromosome 6 [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicated that the putative Chromosome Y sequence is likely incorrect and that the PCR primer pair amplifies the autosomal <italic>CD24</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>Analysis of five clones from each of the eight individuals also revealed four SNPs, three of which were reported in the NCBI database (P1056 A/G, P1527 TG/del, and P1626 A/G). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g001">Figure 1</xref>, following an anchored PCR designed to eliminate the contribution of intronless <italic>CD24</italic> pseudogenes [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], these three polymorphic sites could be identified by restriction enzyme digestion of individual PCR products. The accuracy of the PCR-restriction length fragment polymorphism (RFLP)was confirmed by sequencing the PCR products from 32 individuals. The PCR-RFLP analysis was therefore adopted for genotyping. The genotype distributions of these polymorphisms did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-st001">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, the genotype distributions are essentially the same among males and females among the large set of samples tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-st001">Table S1</xref>). We also used Merlin software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Merlin">http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Merlin</ext-link>) to detect potential genotyping errors [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. No Mendelian inconsistency and obligatory double recombination were found. Taken together, these data ruled out the possibility that the Chromosome Y locus contributes to the data presented in this study and confirmed the accuracy of the genotypes presented.</p>

        <title>Family-Based Tests for the Association between <italic>CD24</italic> Polymorphisms and MS</title>
        <p>Since the above case-control results could potentially be due to population admixture, even though we have restricted the analysis to only the Caucasian samples, we also considered transmission disequilibrium tests using family data, as such a test is still valid under population admixture. We used a total of 150 pedigrees, including 49 pedigrees from the Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Group (MSGG) (with 63 informative nuclear families) and 101 from central Ohio (with 93 informative nuclear families), to determine whether the <italic>CD24</italic> polymorphisms are associated with MS risk. The family compositions of both cohorts are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-st002">Table S2</xref>. A strong association in P1527 was found using TRANSMIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software">http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). No significant association was observed with other SNPs.</p>
        <p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of the four SNPs using the 150 MS and 187 SLE family samples revealed a surprisingly low LD between P170 and P1527 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g002">2</xref>B). Considering the short distance between the SNPs, it is possible that a recombination hotspot may exist in the <italic>CD24</italic> gene. These results, together with the fact that P1056 and P1626 are not significantly associated with MS susceptibility, suggest that P170 and P1527 are independently associated with MS risk. Such an interpretation is plausible since the allele frequencies of the SNPs are not very similar, which diminishes the power of detecting association even for a nearby SNP in high LD with the causal SNP. The significance of the origin of the participant in the association of P170 has been highlighted in recent studies by us and others [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>

        <title>The Association of SNPs P1527 and P1626 with the Progression of MS</title>
        <p>MS disease severity is usually measured according to the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). MS patients who have lost the ability to walk without aid have reached EDSS 6.0. For the majority of the patients, their EDSS 6.0 status was based on a follow-up visit to our center. A few of the cases were based on case history. Because this is one of the most traumatic events in a patient's life, most can recall accurately the time when their disease reached EDSS 6.0. We then tested whether the CD24 genotype affected the time span it took the patients to reach EDSS 6.0 from the day of the first symptom of MS. Clinical data from 275 independent Caucasian MS patients in the Ohio cohorts, but not those from the MSGG, were available for the survival analysis.</p>
        <p>The Kaplan-Meier curves provide estimates of the distribution of the time it took to reach EDSS 6.0 for patients with different genotypes.

        <title>Dinucleotide Deletion at P1527 Leads to an Allele-Specific Reduction of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA</title>
        <p>Since P1527 resides in the 3â² UTR, its polymorphism may affect the accumulation of its mRNA. To address whether mRNA transcribed from the P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele presents a decrease in its expression levels in vivo, we established an allele-specific real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to measure the allele-specific transcripts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, the primers designed for the P1527<italic><sup>TG</sup></italic> allele detected <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA in the P1527<italic><sup>TG/TG</sup></italic>, but not in the P1527<italic><sup>del/del</sup></italic> individuals, and vice versa. These results demonstrate complete specificity of the primers used. In addition, the conditions used led to the amplification of <italic>CD24</italic> cDNA in a strictly dose-dependent fashion over six logs of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It is well established that polymorphisms of immune-related genes modulate host susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including MS and SLE [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Historically, most studies have focused on polymorphisms that result in the replacement of amino acids [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. More recently, substantial information has been accumulated that demonstrates that polymorphisms at the promoter and intron regions can also have a significant impact on susceptibility. These alterations modulate either RNA synthesis (transcription) or splicing [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although it is well established that the 3â² UTR plays a major role in RNA stability, we are not aware of any study reporting that polymorphism at the 3â² UTR modulates susceptibility to autoimmune diseases by changing mRNA stability. Our data presented in this study revealed that a destabilizing dinucleotide deletion in the 3â² UTR of the CD24 gene may confer a significant protection against the risk and progression of MS and against the risk of SLE. Our conclusion is based on five lines of evidence.</p>
      <p>First, a population study with 275 independent Caucasian MS patients and a comparable size of normal controls revealed that individuals with the deletion in at least one allele had about a 2-fold less relative risk in comparison to those without the deletion. Thus, the CD24 P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele may be a protective genetic susceptibility factor for the onset of MS. This is more remarkable in light of the fact that polymorphisms at sites that were only 100â500 bp apart did not have a significant impact on the risk of MS. The strong association at P1527, but not at the nearby SNPs, suggests that the deletion was causatively related to the reduced MS susceptibility. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the frequencies of the associated alleles at the two nearby (flanking) loci are very different from that of the protective allele. A recent study showed that the power to detect the association in such loci is diminished even when there is high linkage disequilibrium [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This also leads to a reasonable explanation as to why two loci in high LD are not both associated with the disease.</p>
      <p>Second, using data from two independent cohorts of families, we also established a strong association of the CD24 P1527 polymorphism with MS. The P1527<italic><sup>TG</sup></italic> allele was preferentially transmitted to affected individuals. This result strongly supports the conclusion from the case-control analysis that the P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele may be a protective genetic susceptibility factor for the onset of MS. Both of these results remain significant after multiple-testing adjustments. Within the Ohio State University (OSU) cohort, our previous data revealed that the P170<italic><sup>T</sup></italic> allele was preferentially transmitted into affected individuals among multiplex families with two or more MS patients [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This result continues to hold with our expanded OSU family set, although not with the MSGG cohort (data not shown). In summary, results from both of population and the family studies confirm our earlier conclusion that the <italic>CD24</italic> locus is a major modulator for MS risk.</p>
      <p>Third, survival analysis revealed a significant association (even after correcting for multiple tests) of <italic>CD24</italic> P1527 with MS disease progression; MS patients with the P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele had a significantly delayed progression. This finding further confirms that the P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele is a protective genetic factor for MS. An interesting issue is whether P1527 is associated with the progression of MS because of its linkage to P170. We consider it very unlikely as our analysis of LD revealed that there is little LD between the two sites despite their close proximity to one another, perhaps due to a recombination hotspot within the <italic>CD24</italic> gene. Moreover, P1056, which is closer to P170, is not associated with the progression of MS. We therefore consider it likely that P170 and P1527 are independently associated with the progression of MS. Since P1626 is less than 100 bp away and shows a strong LD with P1527, it remains possible that its association with MS progression may be due to its proximity to P1527. This interpretation is favored as P1626 shows no association with MS risk. Since our analysis has now covered all known CD24 polymorphisms in the exons, it is likely that P1527, rather than other SNPs, is related to protection against autoimmune diseases.</p>
      <p>Fourth, in addition to MS, which is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, we also observed that the <italic>CD24</italic> P1527<italic><sup>del</sup></italic> allele is preferentially transmitted to unaffected individuals in the SLE family data. It is worth noting that the SLE data should not be regarded as a replication of MS data per se. Rather, our data suggest that the protective effect of the dinucleotide deletion extends to systemic autoimmune diseases. Thus, in addition to its critical role for T-cell proliferation in the central nervous system [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], CD24 may play a role in the development of multiple autoimmune diseases.</p>
      <p>Based on the observed data pattern and the structure of the family cohorts, we have chosen TRANSMIT soft ware to detect association between CD24 polymorphism and risk of autoimmune diseases to maximize the statistical power. However, we caution that TRANSMIT may have inflated type-I error due to its inferences of missing parental genotypes [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Nevertheless, we do not believe the core finding is due to type-I errors, as statistically significant association can also be find with FBAT that deletes data from families without parental information (MS dataset, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04; SLE data set, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01).</p>
      <p>Fifth, the dinucleotide deletion reduced steady levels of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA by more than 2-fold. Thus, in heterozygous patients, the mRNA from the alleles with the deletion was only 50% of that of the alleles without the deletion. This is recapitulated in transfection studies. Analysis of RNA decay kinetics revealed that the half life for the CD24 transcript with the dinucleotide deletion was at least 4-fold shorter than that of the wild-type allele. Since <italic>CD24</italic> was expressed at high levels among some lineages of hematopoietic cells and in the transfected CHO cells, the reduction in the steady levels may underestimate the reduction in other cell types, such as T cells, in which <italic>CD24</italic> is expressed at lower levels and is therefore less likely to saturate the degradation system. The low expression of <italic>CD24</italic> in T cells is essential for homeostatic proliferation of T cells, which has been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases.</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrated that a dinucleotide deletion at the 3â² UTR of the human <italic>CD24</italic> gene confers significant protection against the risk and progression of MS and the risk of SLE. These results not only provide insight into the genetic basis of MS and SLE susceptibility, but, perhaps more importantly, to our knowledge, this is the first report that shows how polymorphisms at the 3â² UTR modulate susceptibility to autoimmune diseases by regulating RNA stability. Since CD24 is a checkpoint for homeostatic proliferation of T cells [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which is implicated in other autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], it will be of great interest to test the contribution of CD24 to the risk and progression of other autoimmune diseases.</p>

        <title>MS patient samples.</title>
        <p>All sample collection and experimentation was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed consents from all participants were obtained before sample collection. Some of the participants had been enrolled in the previous study [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Patients with definite MS, as diagnosed by K.W.R. and D.J.L. at OSUMultiple Sclerosis Center according to the McDonald criteria [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], were offered the opportunity to participate. The clinical diagnosis of MS type and the EDSS score [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] were determined by three of the authors (K.W.R., D.J.L., and N.G.). The time of disease onset and the time when a walking aid was first prescribed (EDSS 6.0) were determined retrospectively by the analysis of case records without knowing <italic>CD24</italic> genotype.</p>
        <p>In the case-control study, we selected a consecutive series of 829 participants including 361 MS patients and 468 normal controls. For the case-control analysis based on participants with the same genetic background, we only used 275 independent Caucasian cases and age and gender-matched 443 Caucasian controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030049-t001">Table 1</xref>). All MS patients were recruited at the OSU Medical Center between January 2000 and March 2006 and agreed to participate in this study. All donors gave written informed consent. The control participants were obtained from the American Red Cross (Columbus, Ohio) between September 1999 and January 2006 using leftover peripheral blood samples.</p>
        <p>In the Ohio family study, 101 pedigrees of MS families were used for association analysis. Of the 346 participants from the families, 135 were MS patients and 211 were non-MS relatives. All MS patients and their unaffected family members were recruited at the OSU Medical Center, and all agreed to participate in this study. We interviewed all MS patients for family history of MS. Consenting family members with or without MS provided blood samples as well. In rare cases, when family members were at other locations, samples were obtained by local physicians or nurses and transported or mailed to our center. Ascertainment of the presence or absence of MS among the relatives was by history alone. Relatives who provided blood samples were not subjected to neurological evaluation or an MRI at our center. These participants were selected between October 2001 and May 2005.</p>
        <p>In the MSGG family study, 321 participants from 49 pedigrees of multiplex MS families were obtained from the MSGG through the University of California San Francisco. Of the participants, 119 were MS patients and 202 were from non-MS relatives. These participants were selected between October 1997 and January 2003.</p>
        <p>Demographics and disease characteristics of the MS patients and controls are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030049-t001">Table 1</xref>. The sex ratio and average age of the OSU MS patients were not significantly different from those of normal controls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.506 in sex; <italic>p</italic> = 0.970 in age). In all of the OSU MS patients, as well as in each of the familial and sporadic groups, there were no significant correlations among age, age at onset, EDSS, duration of the disease, and clinical course (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In the OSU MS patients, no information was obtained for the EDSS score in four patients and the clinical course in three patients. The group of patients with some missing phenotypic information was included in our genetic analysis to be detailed below.</p>
        <p>The comparison of clinical and demographic features between OSU and MSGG family MS patients did not show any significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in the ethnicity between the MS patients of the OSU and the MSGG families, the MS patients of the MSGG families were from a number of other countries besides the United States.</p>

        <title>SLE patient samples.</title>
        <p>Demographics and disease characteristics of the SLE patients and controls are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030049-t003">Table 3</xref>. A total of 264 unrelated SLE patients were consecutively recruited at the Columbus Children's Hospital and Research Institute, OSU, and followed in the Ohio SLE Study. SLE cases for case-control analysis were all independent Caucasians. Healthy race-, sex-, and age-matched participants (270) with no history of autoimmune disease were enrolled from the American Red Cross (Columbus, Ohio). The sex ratio and average age of SLE patients were not significantly different from those of normal controls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.435 in sex; <italic>p</italic> = 0.990 in age). The healthy participants were completely independent from the control participants in the MS group. Both case and control samples were collected between 1999 and 2006.</p>
        <p>A large collection of 187 pedigrees of SLE families was obtained from the Columbus Children's Hospital and Research Institute, OSU, with predominantly one affected offspring per family. Of the 555 participants from the families, 187 were SLE patients and 368 were non-SLE relatives. Samples from both parents were available for 36% of the families, and samples from siblings were also collected where available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-st002">Table S2</xref>). In the case of single-parent families, samples were always taken from siblings. An extensive questionnaire and interview with a trained physician were completed by unaffected family members to determine the absence of SLE.</p>
        <p>The SLE patients were diagnosed according to the classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Only those that were diagnosed as definitive SLE were included in the study. The demography and clinical data for the samples were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030049-t003">Table 3</xref>, using kidney involvement and WHO classifications for disease severity [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. All participants were Caucasians who gave written informed consent. Approval for human study protocols was obtained from the human subjects review board at OSU and the Institutional Review Board.</p>

        <title>Polymorphism identification.</title>
        <p>The genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) by using the QIAamp DNA Blood Minikit (Qiagen, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qiagen.com">http://www.qiagen.com</ext-link>). We searched for polymorphisms in the 3â² UTR of exon 2 using PCR and DNA sequencing, and these polymorphisms were further determined by DNA cloning and sequencing. Since several intronless <italic>CD24</italic> pseudogenes have been identified in the human genome [<xref rid="pgen-0030049-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the functional <italic>CD24</italic> locus was selectively amplified by nested PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The first PCR amplification (Invitrogen <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>) was from intron 1 to the end of exon 2 by using a forward primer (5â²-CTA AAG AGA ATG ACC TTG GTG GGT TGA G-3â²) and a reverse primer (5â²-CAC AGT AGC TTC AAA ACT GTT CGA-3â²). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 Â°C for 30 s, 55 Â°C for 30 s, and 68 Â°C for 2 min for 20 cycles. The predicted <italic>CD24</italic> PCR fragment was 2,017 bp long. The identity of the PCR products to the <italic>CD24</italic> gene sequence on Chromosome 6, but not the putative Chromosome Y locus sequence as well as the SNP in the region was confirmed by cloning and sequencing of the PCR products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030049-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The second PCR amplification (Promega, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.promega.com">http://www.promega.com</ext-link>) was based on each polymorphic site using the primers as follows: a forward primer (5â²-CTA AAG AGA ATG ACC TTG GTG GGT TGA G-3â²) and a reverse primer (5â²-GGA TTG GGT TTA GAA GAT GGG GAA A-3â²) for 170 <italic>C/T</italic> polymorphism (P170) from the <italic>CD24</italic> translation start site, a forward primer (5â²-GGC ATT TCC TAT CAC CTG TTT-3â²) and a reverse primer (5â²-AAT CTA CCC CCA GAT CCA AGC A-3â²) for 1056 <italic>A/G</italic> polymorphism (P1056), a forward primer (5â²-GCA ATT TTG CCT TCA AAA CAG-3â²) and a reverse primer (5â²-TTT AGG CTT AGG ACC AGG TTC-3â²) for 1527â¼1528 <italic>TG/del</italic> polymorphism (P1527), and a forward primer (5â²-CAA CTA TGG ATC AGA ATA GCA ACA AT-3â²) and a reverse primer (5â²-GGAACATCTAAGCATCAGTGTGTG-3â²) for 1626 <italic>A/G</italic> polymorphism (P1626). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 Â°C for 30 s, 55 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 30 s, for 35 cycles. The PCR products were digested overnight with BstXI (50 Â°C) for P170, BstUI (60 Â°C) for P1056, BsrI (65 Â°C) for P1527, and MfeI (37 Â°C) for P1626 (New England Biolabs, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neb.com">http://www.neb.com</ext-link>) and then electrophoresed on 3.0% agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The genotypes were designated as <italic>âC,â âA,â âdel,â</italic> or â<italic>A</italic>â when the restriction sites of BstXI, BstUI, BsrI, and MfeI were respectively absent, and as <italic>âT,â âG,â âTG,â</italic> or <italic>âGâ</italic> when each restriction site was respectively present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030049-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <p>Since case control studies are, in general, sensitive to population stratification, which may render the interpretation of results less than satisfactory, we also considered transmission disequilibrium tests using family data from three cohorts; the OSU MS samples, the MSGG MS samples, and Columbus Children's Hospital SLE samples.

        <title>Analysis of expression data.</title>
        <p>A paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to assess the effect of the dinucleotide deletion of P1527 on the allele-specific reduction of <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA. Due to the small sample size (eight individuals) used, the <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated based on 1,000,000 Monte Carlo simulations without making the normality assumption of the underlying population. For the mRNA stability data, an analysis of variance was performed to test the hypothesis that P1527 modulates <italic>CD24</italic> mRNA stability. The dependency through time was taken into account by modeling the covariance using an autoregressive process. To test our hypothesis, we contrasted the decay patterns of the <italic>CD24<sup>TG</sup></italic> with those of the <italic>CD24<sup>del</sup></italic>. In addition, we tested their difference at each individual time point.</p>
