      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is clinically defined as congenital muscular dystrophy accompanied by a variety of brain and eye malformations. It represents the most severe clinical phenotype in a spectrum of alpha-dystroglycan posttranslational processing abnormalities, which share a defect in laminin binding glycan synthesis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Although six WWS causing genes have been described, only half of all patients can currently be diagnosed genetically<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. A cell fusion complementation assay using fibroblasts from undiagnosed WWS individuals identified five novel complementation groups. Further evaluation of one group by linkage analysis and targeted sequencing identified recessive mutations in the isoprenoid synthase domain containing (<italic>ISPD</italic>) gene. Confirmation of the pathogenicity of the identified <italic>ISPD</italic> mutations was demonstrated by complementation of fibroblasts with wild-type <italic>ISPD</italic>. Finally, we show that recessive mutations in <italic>ISPD</italic> abolish the initial step in laminin binding glycan synthesis by disrupting dystroglycan <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation. This establishes a novel mechanism for WWS pathophysiology.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">The hallmark of dystroglycanopathies - and the common pathogenic denominator in all WWS (MIM# 236670) patients - is loss of functional glycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Lack of proper Î±-DG glycosylation reduces binding to extracellular matrix proteins since the ligand binding is mediated through the Î±-DG sugar moiety<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. All six of the causative genes previously identified in WWS patients demonstrate autosomal recessive inheritance and code for known or putative glycosyltransferases; mutations therein result in abnormal Î±-DG glycosylation<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, approximately half of the WWS patient population has no mutations in these known genes<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, emphasizing the need for WWS gene discovery.</p>
    <p id="P3">We established a complementation assay to enable us to identify additional genes that contribute to WWS pathology. This assay was developed based on a panel of fibroblasts from six genetically defined, but heterogeneous dystroglycanopathy cases (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), for which western blotting revealed a lack of functional glycosylation (defined as immunoreactivity to IIH6, a monoclonal antibody specific for requisite sugar moiety) and an inability to bind laminin (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The results are consistent with previously published data obtained from various dystroglycanopathy patient tissues<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and cells<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Notably, the degrees of Î±-DG hypoglycosylation varied by the gene mutated, and the molecular weight of Î±-DG produced in each case is hypothesized to reflect an abnormality at different steps in Î±-DG glycan biosynthesis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). For each patient population the Î±-DG glycosylation defect was rescued by transferring a wild-type copy of the mutant gene. For example, in WWS fibroblasts with known <italic>POMT1</italic> mutations, Î±-DG functional glycosylation was restored by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of <italic>POMT1</italic>, but not by expression of the other known WWS genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This complementation assay was adapted to On-Cell western blotting, and rescue of Î±-DG functional glycosylation was demonstrated for all known WWS genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Previously, it was shown that forced overexpression of the putative glycosyltransferase LARGE can induce Î±-DG hyperglycosylation in control cells and bypass the Î±-DG glycosylation defect in dystroglycanopathy patient cells<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, we now demonstrate that the ability of LARGE to hyperglycosylate Î±-DG is dependent on the availability of <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl phosphate acceptor sites and correlates with the severity of the clinical phenotype (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">We next applied the On-Cell complementation assay to fibroblasts from a cohort of 63 dystroglycanopathy patients (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), identifying 11 WWS individuals from 10 unrelated families, who we postulated to have mutations in novel genes. Our first step toward defining the genetic basis for WWS in these patients was to establish complementation groups; to this end we adapted a cell fusion approach that is commonly used in yeast research<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and has proven successful in mammalian cells<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Whereas fusion is achieved by mating in the case of yeast cells, polyethylene glycol (PEG)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> treatment is used for mammalian cells. We hypothesized that fusion between co-cultured cells from patients harboring recessive mutations in the same gene would not rescue the Î±-DG glycosylation defect, whereas fusion between cells from patients with independent genetic defects would rescue successfully. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed IIH6-positive fused cells (as indicated by the presence of multiple nuclei) only when two cell lines from genetically different patients were co-cultured; complementation between <italic>POMT1</italic> and <italic>FKTN</italic> fibroblasts is shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. Two-way fusions of WWS cells with mutations in each of the known genes rescued Î±-DG glycosylation (data not shown). Application of the PEG fusion approach to all 11 genetically unidentified WWS patients led to the identification of five separate complementation groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>), suggesting that five novel WWS genes are represented in this small cohort of patients. While four complementation groups were represented by a single WWS patient, one group consisted of seven WWS individuals. If mutations in a single novel gene are responsible for disease in all seven patients, this complementation group should represent a relative common cause of WWS.</p>
    <p id="P5">All seven patients within this complementation group met the classic diagnostic criteria for WWS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Two of the cases, P5<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and P6<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, were previously published and described as WWS. In the case of P1, brain MRI examinations performed at 3 days and 5 months of age, showed hydrocephalus, cobblestone lissencephaly of the cerebral cortex, severe brainstem hypoplasia with a kink at the isthmus, and severe hypoplasia of the cerebellum (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This patient also displayed evidence of severe muscular dystrophy (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), bilateral microophthalmia with cataracts and arrested retinal development. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of a skeletal muscle biopsy from this patient showed that this new complementation group of WWS patients manifests the typical Î±-DG glycosylation defect in skeletal muscle with loss of both functional glycosylation and receptor function (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Comparative analysis of the Î±-DG glycosylation status in fibroblasts from five different WWS cases in the same complementation group confirmed that all samples share a defect in Î±-DG processing, with complete loss of functional glycosylation and laminin binding (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Moreover, the loss of post-translational modification and a subsequent shift to lower molecular weight was comparable in all samples, consistent with the hypothesis that they share a common genetic defect.</p>
    <p id="P6">Our first step toward identifying the underlying genetic defect in the large complementation cohort, was to perform linkage analysis to identify candidate regions. As reliable family history regarding consanguinity was not available for all cases, regions of homozygosity-by-descent were identified using high-resolution SNP arrays. Besides the sibling pair P2 and P3, four of the five unrelated patients showed multiple long (&gt;10cM) stretches of homozygosity, suggesting some degree of consanguinity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We searched for regions where P2 and P3 are identical on both alleles and all or a subset of the four suspected consanguineous samples are homozygous. All 7,113 coding exons across 14 overlapping intervals were subjected to targeted sequencing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). All seven samples were bar-coded, pooled, captured by one custom-designed capture array and sequenced on a lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 flowcell as a 50bp paired-end run. The sequence data were processed through a custom-built analysis pipeline, and after variant filter strategies were applied, six genes were identified for which at least two independent protein-damaging variants passed the hard-filtration (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Based on genetic evidence, <italic>ISPD</italic> was the most likely candidate gene. After manually examining the variants that did not meet filter criteria, as well as augmentation of the dataset with Sanger sequencing of P5 which was poorly covered, a total of four heterozygous variants and four homozygous variants were found in <italic>ISPD</italic> which identified multiple rare variants in all six independent cases (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). All mutations were predicted to damage or abolish protein function, as expected in individuals with a severe form of dystroglycanopathy such as WWS<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>ISPD</italic> was localized to chromosome 7p21.2, a region in which three of the four suspected consanguineous patients had intervals of homozygosity longer than 10cM and P2 and P3 shared both parental alleles (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). A schematic representation of all <italic>ISPD</italic> mutations identified in our patient cohort is shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P7">To confirm the pathogenicity of the identified <italic>ISPD</italic> mutations, we conducted complementation assays on fibroblasts derived from the <italic>ISPD</italic>-WWS patients. In the patient cells, expression of wild-type <italic>ISPD,</italic> but not that of a mutant isoform (P6, <italic>ISPD</italic>-ÎE3) restored functional glycosylation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>); in control cells, such overexpression did not significantly alter functional Î±-DG glycosylation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Functional rescue of patient cells confirmed that the identified <italic>ISPD</italic> mutations have pathogenic relevance, and indicated that severe mutations in <italic>ISPD</italic> can cause WWS.</p>
    <p id="P8">Notably, <italic>ISPD</italic> has not been characterized in mammals. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that <italic>ISPD</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed, with expression highest in brain (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). ISPD belongs to the family of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME) synthases (also known as 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferases), that are conserved from bacteria to mammals (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). In <italic>E.coli,</italic> IspD activity contributes to the methylerythritol pathway (MEP) in its synthesis of isoprenoid precursors<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, which give rise to the polyisoprenoid alcohols (e.g., dolichols and polyprenols) found in all living organisms<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). However, the MEP pathway is used only by eubacteria, green algae and the chloroplasts of higher plants<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and the cytosol of higher plants are thought to use an alternative, ISPD-independent mevalonate (MVA) pathway for isoprenoid synthesis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. As the MEP pathway involving ISPD is postulated to be absent from animals, the specific role of ISPD in humans, especially in regards to Î±-DG glycosylation, is unclear.</p>
    <p id="P9">To investigate the role of ISPD in Î±-DG glycosylation, we tested <italic>ISPD</italic>-WWS patients for changes in any known steps in laminin binding glycan synthesis. Notably, protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation, the initiating step, was markedly reduced in fibroblasts lacking functional ISPD, as were downstream events like <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl phosphorylation and LARGE-induced hyperglycosylation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5aâc</xref>). These findings suggest that ISPD function is crucial for efficient POMT-dependent <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation and subsequent glycosylation of Î±-DG (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">In this study, we have identified a novel WWS disease gene in patient fibroblasts by using a complementation assay in combination with targeted sequencing. This approach provided conclusive genetic and biochemical evidence that recessive mutations in <italic>ISPD</italic> lead to impaired Î±-DG <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation, establishing a novel WWS pathomechanism. Further studies are needed to determine how defects in <italic>ISPD</italic> influence protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation, as this is the first WWS gene without proposed glycosyltransferase activity and direct role in Î±-DG glycosylation.</p>

Specific POMT activity in control cells was determined as 536.7 pmol/g/h. The diagram shows relative POMT activity in reference to control cells (n=3). Error bars represent s.d. (<bold>b</bold>) [<sup>32</sup>P]-orthophosphate labeling of DGFc5-expressing cultured cells from control and <italic>ISPD</italic> P2 cells. After <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl residues are transferred, the radioactive [<sup>32</sup>P]-orthophosphate is incorporated to form a phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-linked mannose glycan<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The ISPD sample shows markedly reduced [<sup>32</sup>P] labeling due to reduced number of <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl acceptor sites. (<bold>c</bold>) Quantitative On-Cell western analysis of LARGE-induced Î±-DG hyperglycosylation. The glycosyltransferase LARGE participates in a post-phosphoryl modification transferring the laminin-binding glycan. Forced expression of LARGE increases the affinity of the cell surface for the IIH6 antibody in control cells, but not in <italic>POMT1</italic> and <italic>ISPD</italic> deficient WWS cells, confirming that the mutant cells lack the <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl acceptors of the post-phosphoryl modification. IIH6 On-Cell quantitative data were normalized with DRAQ5 cell DNA dye (n=3). Error bars represent s.d.</p>
