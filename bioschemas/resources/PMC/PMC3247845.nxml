          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common, highly invasive malignant tumor associated with a high mortality rate. We previously reported that the aberrant expression of Snail via activation of reactive oxygen species contributes to the invasive property of HCC, in part by downregulation of E-cadherin through both transcriptional repression and epigenetic modification of the E-cadherin promoter. Having demonstrated the ability of Snail to bind and recruit histone deacetylase 1 and DNA methyltransferase 1 in this context, we set out to look for other interactions that could affect its ability to promote oncogenic transformation and cancer cell invasion.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Using cells that stably expressed Snail, we characterized Snail protein interactors by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitation and subcellular colocalization studies were performed to confirm our identification of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) as a novel Snail-binding partner. NICD interaction with Snail was found to induce ubiquitination and MDM2-dependent degradation of Snail. Interestingly, NICD inhibited Snail-dependent invasive properties in both HCC cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Our study demonstrates that NICD can oppose Snail-dependent HCC cell invasion by binding and inducing proteolytic degradation of Snail. Although Notch signaling and Snail are both widely considered tumor-promoting factors, our findings indicate that the individual oncogenic contribution of Notch1 and Snail in malignant systems should be interpreted carefully, particularly when they are conjointly expressed.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common, highly invasive malignant tumor associated with a high mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The resistance of HCC to existing antineoplastic agents and the limited effectiveness of chemotherapies due to underlying liver disease contribute to the poor prognosis for patients with HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although surgical resection is the preferred standard of care for patients with HCC, few patients are suitable candidates for this treatment and recurrence is common even after radical curative resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Given the inadequate impact of conventional therapies and the rising incidence of HCC, elucidation of the oncogenic mechanisms underlying HCC development is critical for identifying potential therapeutic targets or modalities.</p>
      <p>Snail is a well-known zinc finger (ZF) transcriptional repressor responsible for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) and metastasis in several cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We previously reported that upregulation of human <italic>SNAI1 </italic>(Snail) expression by reactive oxygen species contributes to the invasive nature of HCC, in part by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and downregulating E-cadherin expression through both transcriptional repression and epigenetic modification of the E-cadherin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other recent reports have revealed that Snail induces broad epigenetic modifications of target genes by interacting with tumor-associated proteins (including HDAC1, DNMT1 and p53) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Taken together, the ability of Snail to promote oncogenic transformation and cancer cell invasion is likely mediated by its interactions with other proteins in addition to its transcriptional activity.</p>
      <p>The Notch signaling pathway regulates embryonic cell determination and differentiation as well as postnatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although alterations in the Notch pathway are associated with malignant processes, there is also evidence that supports a tumor-suppressive role for Notch signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Activation of the Notch pathway is initiated through juxtacrine ligand-receptor interactions and the proteolytic cleavage of Notch1 by Î³-secretase, which liberates the <italic>Notch1 </italic>intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane, allowing NICD to translocate to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nuclear NICD then associates with CSL (<underline>C</underline>BF1/RBPJk in vertebrates, <underline>S</underline>uppressor of hairless in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <underline>L</underline>ag-1 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) transcriptional factors to inhibit CSL transcriptional repression of Notch target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Of note, though both NICD and Snail proteins are known to play a central role in cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis, Notch signaling is also capable of inhibiting HCC tumor growth through the induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we have identified NICD as a novel Snail binding partner by using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in HCC cells. Using HCC cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we demonstrate that NICD can induce Snail degradation and impede Snail-dependent cell invasion. Although Snail is known to be degraded by the Î²-TrCP1 and FBXL14 E3 ubiquitin ligases, our data indicate that NICD-mediated Snail degradation may instead be dependent on MDM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p>

        <title>NICD is a novel binding partner of Snail</title>
        <p>To elucidate regulatory factors of Snail, we sought to identify its binding partners by performing MS/MS (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We identified Notch1 as a Snail-associated protein (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and confirmed an endogenous Snail and Notch1 interaction by performing coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In both analyses, the size of the detected Notch1 protein was approximately between 100 and 150 kDa, suggesting that Snail binds to the proteolytically cleaved intracellular domain of Notch1, known as NICD. Using the Duolink II assay (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden), we have shown that endogenous Snail and Notch1 proteins interact in multiple cancer lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, with each red dot in the images representing a fluorescent signal from a Snail-Notch1 interaction). Colocalization of NICD and Snail in nuclear foci by immunofluorescence corroborates the interaction of the two proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p>

        <title>The ANK domain of NICD and the zinc finger domain of Snail are required for NICD and Snail interaction</title>
        <p>NICD contains a RBP-J Îº-associated module (RAM) domain, seven ankyrin/cdc10 repeats (ANK) domain, two nuclear localization signals, a transcriptional transactivation domain (TAD), a polyglutamine tract (OPA) domain and a proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich (PEST) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Snail contains a highly conserved C-terminal region, a ZF domain and a divergent N-terminal (SNAG) domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We mapped interacting domains of NICD and Snail by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using deletion mutants of both proteins and found that the Snail ZF domain and the NICD ANK domain were responsible for the interaction between the two molecules (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). To exclude the possibility that altered cellular localization was responsible for the inability of the Snail-ÎZF mutant to bind NICD, we performed glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pull-down assays using GST-Snail wild-type (WT), ÎZF and ZF mutants, which showed that only the Snail-ÎZF mutant did not interact with NICD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p>

        <title>NICD downregulates Snail protein</title>
        <p>To clarify the role of the interaction between NICD and Snail, we transfected Hep3B cells with hemagglutinin (HA)-Snail and Myc-NICD constructs. Interestingly, we observed that the HA-Snail protein was dramatically decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Myc-NICD (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Under the same experimental conditions in which NICD and Snail were coexpressed, there was no change in the level of Snail mRNA in comparison with cells that expressed HA-Snail alone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Furthermore, we performed additional experiments using endogenous Snail protein-upregulated conditions. In our previous study, reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment-upregulated Snail mRNA and protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, Myc-NICD downregulated the Snail protein level, not the mRNA level, although in normal conditions Myc-NICD upregulated Snail mRNA expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that NICD may decrease Snail expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism.</p>

        <title>NICD induces degradation of the Snail protein by ubiquitination</title>
        <p>NICD-induced decrease of Snail protein was inhibited by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that NICD promotes Snail degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Treatment of Snail and NICD cotransfected cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, revealed that the protein half-life of Snail is shortened in the presence of NICD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). As Snail is known to be tagged by ubiquitin for proteolytic degradation, we sought to determine whether NICD could induce Snail ubiquitination by examining ubiquitinated Snail in cells cotransfected with Flag-Snail and Myc-NICD WT or Myc-NICD ÎANK mutant (Mut). Because NICD ÎANK Mut does not interact with the Snail protein, we hypothesized that Snail would not be ubiquitinated in its presence. In agreement with this hypothesis, ubiquitinated Flag-Snail was detected only in Flag-Snail and Myc-NICD WT cotransfected cells and not in Flag-Snail and ÎANK Mut transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

        <p>Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Myc-NICD can interact with MDM2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In a previous report, we found that Snail may also bind MDM2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These data support the notion that NICD induces degradation of the Snail protein via MDM2-mediated ubiquitination because NICD has no known intrinsic E3 ligase function. Indeed, in Hep3B cells cotransfected with Myc-NICD and MDM2 siRNA, NICD-induced Snail degradation was decreased compared to control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²) is known to induce Snail phosphorylation and degradation through the E3 ubiquitin ligase Î²-TrCP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To determine whether NICD-induced Snail degradation is reliant on GSK-3Î²/Î²-TrCP1, we analyzed the protein level of the Snail 2SA mutant, which has two point mutations in the Î²-TrcP motif, in cells cotransfected with Snail 2SA mutant and NICD. We found that both the Snail WT and 2SA mutant proteins were uniformly degraded by NICD, implying that NICD-induced Snail degradation is a Î²-TrcP-independent phenomenon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p>

        <title>NICD induces degradation of endogenous Snail protein</title>
        <p>To determine whether NICD could regulate endogenous levels of Snail protein, we treated Hep3B and Huh7 cells with Notch1 siRNA to silence NICD expression. In Notch1 siRNA-transfected cells, endogenous Snail protein levels were elevated relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). We confirmed these results using a murine stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviral system to express NICD (MSCV-NICD) in MEFs and Hep3B cells. In both cell types, NICD expression led to decreased levels of endogenous Snail protein but upregulation of p21, an established Notch target gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Correspondingly, expression of Jagged1, an activating ligand of Notch signaling, repressed Snail protein levels only in the absence of DAPT (<italic>N</italic>-[<italic>N</italic>-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-<italic>S</italic>-phenylglycine <underline><italic>t</italic></underline>-butyl ester), a Î³-secretase inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Taken together, our results thus far show that physiological activation of the Notch pathway or NICD expression is necessary and sufficient for Snail degradation.</p>

        <title>Snail and NICD regulate the invasiveness of HCC cells</title>
        <p>To understand the function of the NICD-Snail interaction, we infected primary MEFs with the MSCV driving Myc-NICD and/or Flag-Snail genes and evaluated Snail protein levels. Predictably, in Myc-NICD and Flag-Snail coinfected samples, NICD-induced Snail degradation was observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Given that Notch1 and Snail signaling individually regulate cell invasion, we considered whether their interaction might perturb their native functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Using a cell invasion assay, we found that the number of invading Snail and NICD coinfected cells was significantly less than that of cells infected by Snail or NICD alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Parallel findings were observed in Huh7 and Hep3B cells in which coexpression of Snail and NICD suppressed invasiveness (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Additionally, the number of invading cells was much greater in cells that had been transfected with Notch1 siRNA than those transfected with control siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previously, Notch1 was shown to cooperate with the Snail pathway by upregulating Snail transcription, inducing EMT and promoting hypoxia-induced tumor cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, we found that NICD, which is an intracellular functional molecule liberated from Notch1, can suppress Snail protein via direct binding. This suggests that the Notch1-Snail pathway includes not only the single functional pathway but also a reciprocal interrelationship. Although both NICD and Snail protein play a central role in cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], their physical interaction has not been described previously. Given the highly invasive phenotype of HCC and the overexpression of Snail in HCC tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we utilized HCC cell lines as a model cell system in which to study the functional involvement of NICD-Snail interaction in disease development.</p>
      <p>Notch1 is known to regulate Snail and Slug mRNA levels, but efforts have not been made to examine alternative functions of NICD and Snail expression in the same cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In this study, we have demonstrated the ability of NICD to associate with Snail to induce its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. NICD has been reported to upregulate Snail activity by inducing Snail mRNA expression under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, Notch1 is related to the mesenchymal program by activating Snail expression in cardiac development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our findings appear to be inconsistent with these previous results. However, because Notch signals and cellular functions vary according to cell type and cellular environment, these inconsistencies could be caused by the different cell types and conditions. Although ectopic expression of NICD slightly induced Snail transcription, we postulate that the genetic interaction between Snail and NICD and their physical association may be physiologically exclusive events, which may account for their contrasting cellular effects. In our previous study, ROS stress upregulated Snail mRNA and protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the ROS-treated cells, Myc-NICD downregulated the Snail protein level, not the mRNA level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These latter data indicate that, under conditions of exogenous Snail expression or endogenous Snail upregulation by ROS stress, NICD reduces Snail protein levels by inducing Snail degradation without affecting Snail transcription. Because the NICD ÎANK mutant failed to induce ubiquitination and degradation of Snail, it appears that the physical interaction of NICD and Snail is required for the degenerative process. NICD is not known to have inherent E3 ligase functions, indicating that NICD may initiate or serve as a cofactor of the degradation signal. We have shown that Myc-NICD interacts with MDM2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), but the NICD ÎANK mutant did not (data not shown). In addition, in MDM2 siRNA-transfected cells, NICD-induced Snail degradation was decreased compared to control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), suggesting that MDM2 has a role in NICD-induced Snail degradation.</p>
      <p>We attempted to improve the transient transfection conditions with a stably NICD-expressing cell line based on a retroviral expression system. In these cells, the expression levels of NICD were much lower than those found with transient transfection. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> NICD-induced Snail degradation occurred in our stably NICD-expressing cells. In addition, to show that ligand-stimulated, NICD-induced Snail degradation took place, we used the cell line that expressed the exogenous Jagged1 ligand. In these cells, NICD induced Snail degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Moreover, Notch1 siRNA upregulated endogenous Snail protein levels, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. These data suggest that NICD-induced Snail degradation occurs in certain physiological conditions.</p>
      <p>In this study, NICD-induced degradation of Snail inhibited Snail-dependent invasive behavior, as expected. Consistent with these invasion data, E-cadherin expression decreased in Snail-overexpressed cells, but it did not in Snail- and NICD-coexpressed cells compared to control cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In our previous study, we reported p53-induced Snail degradation via MDM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Notch1 expression and signaling were regulated differently, depending on p53 status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In other systems, Notch1 related to the mesenchymal program by activating Snail expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In another previous study, we showed that Notch1 and Snail differentially regulate invasion of HCC cells depending on p53 status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The inhibition of invasion by NICD and Snail coexpression was observed in both Hep3B cells (p53-null) and Huh7 cells (p53-mutant). On the other hand, in p53 WT cells such as HepG2, NICD and Snail coexpression promotes invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the present study, we showed NICD regulated invasion via Snail degradation in p53-null or p53-mutant status. On the basis of these reports, we suspect that the interactions among p53, MDM2, Notch1 and Snail play an important role in EMT. Furthermore, these data explain the context-dependent regulation of EMT by the Notch signaling system. Our study provides one clue for understanding the complex regulation mechanism of p53, MDM2, Notch1 and Snail in the EMT process. The regulation of these proteins and their physiological contribution to HCC development and malignant behavior require further investigation. However, the mechanism that we have described presents substantial evidence of cross-interference between the Notch and Snail signaling pathways, which is mediated by their direct binding.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Herein we have identified NICD as a novel binding partner of Snail. Our results indicate that the interaction between NICD and Snail promotes Snail ubiquitination and degradation through an MDM2-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, we have shown that NICD impairs Snail-associated cell invasion in a conserved manner between MEFs and HCC cells. These findings collectively suggest that in the instance in which Notch1 and Snail are conjointly present, Notch signaling may serve as an antagonist of Snail function. The results of our research ultimately support caution in the use of genetic or pharmacological strategies that solely target the Notch pathway for therapeutic treatment in Snail-associated HCC. Further investigation is warranted to fully determine the precise cellular processes disrupted by Notch inhibition and thus to better assess the therapeutic value and clinical implications of Notch pathway antagonists.</p>

        <p>Bacterial lysate expressing GST-Snail proteins (WT, ÎZF and ZF mutants) was purified by immobilization on glutathione Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech/GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The beads were thoroughly washed with wash buffer (20 mM TrisÂ·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The bound proteins were incubated with Myc-NICD-transfected cell lysate, washed with the wash buffer and eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer for 10 minutes. The sample was then analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>
