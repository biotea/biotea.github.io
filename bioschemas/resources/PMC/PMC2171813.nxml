        <p>The interaction of talin with phosphatidylinositol(4) phosphate 5 kinase type IÎ³ (PIPKIÎ³) regulates PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis at synapses and at focal adhesions. Here, we show that phosphorylation of serine 650 (S650) within the talin-binding sequence of human PIPKIÎ³ blocks this interaction. At synapses, S650 is phosphorylated by p35/Cdk5 and mitogen-activated protein kinase at rest, and dephosphorylated by calcineurin upon stimulation. S650 is also a substrate for cyclin B1/Cdk1 and its phosphorylation in mitosis correlates with focal adhesion disassembly. Phosphorylation by Src of the tyrosine adjacent to S650 (Y649 in human PIPKIÎ³) was shown to enhance PIPKIÎ³ targeting to focal adhesions (Ling, K., R.L. Doughman, V.V. Iyer, A.J. Firestone, S.F. Bairstow, D.F. Mosher, M.D. Schaller, and R.A. Anderson. 2003. <italic>J. Cell Biol.</italic> 163:1339â1349). We find that Y649 phosphorylation does not stimulate directly PIPKIÎ³ binding to talin, but may do so indirectly by inhibiting S650 phosphorylation. Conversely, S650 phosphorylation inhibits Y649 phosphorylation by Src. The opposite effects of the phosphorylation of Y649 and S650 likely play a critical role in regulating synaptic function as well as the balance between cell adhesion and cell motility.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), a phosphoinositide highly enriched at the plasma membrane, plays a key role in intracellular signaling (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">De Camilli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Takenawa and Itoh, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yin and Janmey, 2003</xref>). The main pathway for the generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol(4)phosphate (PI(4)P) by the so-called type I PIP kinases, which function primarily as PI(4)P 5-kinases (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1998</xref>). The three catalytically active members of this family differ in cellular and subcellular distribution and, thus, control specific PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> pools (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Doughman et al., 2003</xref>). PIP kinase type IÎ³ (PIPKIÎ³), which is expressed at high levels in the brain, comprises splice variants (PIPKIÎ³87 and PIPKIÎ³90) that differ because of the presence of a 28-aa tail (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1998</xref>). An additional splice variant that contains a 26-aa insert before the 28-aa tail was described recently (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Giudici et al., 2004</xref>). Via the sequence WVYSPL contained within the 28-aa tail, PIPKIÎ³90 interacts with, and is activated by, talin (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>), which is an adaptor between the cytoplasmic domain of most Î² integrins (cell-surface receptors involved in cell adhesion) and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood and Ginsberg, 2003</xref>). Isoforms including the 28-aa tail predominate in brain, where they are concentrated at synapses (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, talin is present at synapses (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>), and the relatively smaller pools of PIPKIÎ³90 present in nonneuronal cells are concentrated at focal adhesion sites (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>). Disruption of the talinâPIPKIÎ³90 interaction at synapses disrupts synaptic vesicle recycling and actin dynamics (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>), while its perturbation in nonneuronal cells affects cell adhesion (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Binding of talin to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin Î² subunits induces conformational changes in the extracellular portion of the Î±/Î² integrin dimer leading to increased affinity for extracellular ligands (the so-called inside-out signaling) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood and Ginsberg, 2003</xref>). Conversely, cell adhesion to substrates induces the nucleation of focal adhesions and the nucleation of the associated actin cytoskeleton. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is known to play an important regulatory role in this bidirectional signaling by its interactions with many proteins of focal adhesions, including talin (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Takenawa and Itoh, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yin and Janmey, 2003</xref>). Talin binds to PIPKIÎ³90 via its band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain, primarily by its F3 subdomain (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>), which also comprises the binding site for Î² integrin (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 1999</xref>). In fact, the interactions of PIPKIÎ³90 and Î² integrin with the F3 subdomain are mutually exclusive (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barsukov et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of constructs composing the 28-aa tail of PIPKIÎ³90 produces a âtrans-dominant inhibitionâ of integrin function, by competing for its binding to talin (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 2004</xref>). The tyrosine of the sequence WVYSPL undergoes endogenous phosphorylation by Src (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>). This phosphorylation reaction, which may contribute to the stimulatory effect of focal adhesion kinase on focal adhesions, was reported to enhance the interaction between PIPKIÎ³90 and talin's F3 subdomain, which has a phosphotyrosine binding domain-like fold (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Alvarez et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>PIPKIÎ³, in concert with the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>), plays an important regulatory function in synaptic physiology. Based on genetic studies and other experimental approaches, it was proposed that PIPKIÎ³ controls a plasma membrane pool of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> implicated in synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2004</xref>) and that synaptojanin dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> during the endocytic reaction (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wenk and De Camilli, 2004</xref>). At synapses, both PIPKIÎ³ (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>) and synaptojanin (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), as well as several other proteins implicated in vesicle recycling and actin function (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bauerfeind et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tomizawa et al., 2003</xref>), undergo constitutive phosphorylation and stimulation-dependent, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dephosphorylation. At least for some of these proteins, phosphorylation at rest as well as rapid rephosphorylation after a depolarization stimulus is mediated by Cdk5 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tomizawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, dephosphorylation is mediated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bauerfeind et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>). In the case of synaptojanin 1, its dephosphorylation by calcineurin triggers its recruitment and activation at endocytic sites from a cytosolic pool (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The goal of the present study was to examine the regulation by phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90. Our results demonstrate that S650 within the talin-binding sequence WVYSPL is a main target of regulation by phosphorylation and that S650 phosphorylation blocks talin binding. Furthermore, a mutually antagonistic relationship exists between Src and proline-directed kinases with regard to the phosphorylation of adjacent sites on PIPKIÎ³90, thereby providing a mechanism for the bidirectional modulation of interactions between PIPKIÎ³90 and talin. This regulation is not restricted to synapses and may play an important and general function at focal adhesions.</p>

        <title>p35/Cdk5 phosphorylates PIPKIÎ³90 at serine 650</title>
        <p>As a first step to determine whether Cdk5 may be responsible, at least in part, for the constitutive phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90 in resting synapses, we tested the ability of PIPKIÎ³90 to serve as a substrate for Cdk5 in vitro. Incubation of GST fusion protein of human PIPKIÎ³90 with purified p35/Cdk5 at an â¼1:1 stoichiometric ratio resulted in its efficient phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Similar results were obtained with His<sub>6</sub>-tagged PIPKIÎ³90 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), which was used for all subsequent phosphorylation experiments. p35, a prominent physiological substrate for the kinase activity of Cdk5 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dhavan and Tsai, 2001</xref>), was also efficiently phosphorylated, as expected, and with similar kinetics during a 30-min incubation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Two Cdk5 inhibitors, roscovitine (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2003</xref>) and butyrolactone I (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), inhibited the phosphorylation of both proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). A stoichiometric analysis revealed the incorporation of 2 mol phosphate/mol PIPKIÎ³90, which suggests at least two phosphorylation sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D).</p>

        <p>To identify the residues phosphorylated by Cdk5, His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 was phosphorylated by p35/Cdk5 in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P[ATP] and subjected to trypsin fragmentation followed by HPLC separation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/mass spectrometry (MALDI/MS) analysis and Edman radio-sequencing of the major radioactive peptide identified serine 650 (S650) (human sequence) as likely being a major site of phosphorylation. S650 is found within the sequence (S/T)PX(H/K/R) that fits the known Cdk5 consensus motif (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dhavan and Tsai, 2001</xref>). Notably, this sequence is part of the talin-binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>). The identification of S650 was confirmed by two-dimensional (2-D) phosphopeptide mapping of in vitroâphosphorylated His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 and His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³87 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F), which differ only by the presence or absence of the 28-aa tail. Although several identical radioactive peptides were observed for both isoforms, one major peptide and an adjacent accessory peptide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F, circled region) were observed only for PIPKIÎ³90 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F). Phosphorylation of these two peptides saturated more rapidly than the other peptides based on comparison of autoradiograms obtained from 5-, 30-, and 60-min phosphorylation reactions (unpublished data). When S650 was mutated to alanine (S650A), these peptides were no longer observed. These data indicate that, at least in vitro, S650 is the most rapidly phosphorylated, although not the only, site for Cdk5 in PIPKIÎ³90. Two other sites, serine 453 and threonine 123, that are common to PIPKIÎ³90 and PIPKIÎ³87 fit the Cdk5 consensus motif. Preliminary experiments indicate that Cdk5 may phosphorylate S453; in contrast, mutation of T123 to alanine did not alter the 2-D phosphopeptide mapping pattern (unpublished data). In this study, we have focused on S650 because of its location within the minimal talin-binding motif (WVYSPL).</p>
        <p>To further confirm the site of phosphorylation and for use in the studies described later, an antibody that specifically recognizes PIPKIÎ³90 phosphorylated at S650 (antiâphospho-S650 [pS650] antibody) was raised. The pS650 antibody selectively recognized WT PIPKIÎ³90 phosphorylated in vitro by p35/Cdk5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Under the same conditions (after 30-min incubation), the S650A mutant was phosphorylated to a much lower extent as revealed by the incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P (reflecting one or other phosphorylation sites besides S650), and no signal was detected with the pS650 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). WT or S650A HA-PIPKIÎ³90 was transfected into CHO cells with p35 plus Cdk5. Using the pS650 antibody to analyze immunoprecipitated PIPKIÎ³90, the WT, but not the S650 mutant, protein was found to be phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Omission of p35 and Cdk5, or transfection with catalytically inactive mutant of Cdk5 (mut-Cdk5; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Patrick et al., 1999</xref>) resulted in a significantly lower phosphorylation of S650 compared with that observed after transfection with p35/Cdk5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Under these conditions, S650 may be phosphorylated by low levels of endogenous Cdk5 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dhavan and Tsai, 2001</xref>) and/or by other proline-directed protein kinases (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of S650 inhibits the interaction of PIPKIÎ³90 with talin in vitro and in vivo</title>
        <p>Given the location of S650 in the middle of the talin-binding sequence (WVYSPL; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>), the possibility that phosphorylation of S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 inhibits its interaction with talin was next examined. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to analyze the binding of the GST-talin head (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>), which comprises the FERM domain, to synthetic 12-mer dephospho- and phosphopeptides encompassing the talin-binding sequence of PIPKIÎ³90. <italic>K</italic>

        <p>We further examined whether the in vivo interaction of PIPKIÎ³90 with talin is inhibited by Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation. CHO cells were transfected with HA-PIPKIÎ³90, p35, and either Cdk5 or mut-Cdk5 (as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Cell lysates were then processed for anti-PIPKIÎ³90 or antitalin immunoprecipitation, and the starting lysates and the resulting pellets were analyzed by Western blotting for transfected and control proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). Talin coprecipitated with HA-PIPKIÎ³90, and HA-PIPKIÎ³90 coprecipitated with talin, as expected. However, expression of Cdk5, but not mut-Cdk5, strongly inhibited the coprecipitation of the two proteins.</p>
        <p>We next determined whether a phosphomimetic mutation of S650 to aspartic acid (S650D) affected the interaction with talin. WT and S650D His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 were overlaid in a âfar-Westernâ assay with a GST fusion protein of the F3 subdomain of the FERM domain of talin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and C</xref>). The F3 domain clearly bound to the WT protein, as expected (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>), but no binding was observed for the S650D mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Binding of the F3 domain to the S650A mutant was also reduced, although not abolished, and this is in agreement with a potential role of the side chain of serine in the binding (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liddington et al., 2003</xref>). These results were qualitatively confirmed by His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 pull-down assays from rat brain extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). In this case, the loss of binding produced by the S650A mutation was nearly as large as that produced by the S650D mutation.</p>

        <p>The effect of the phosphomimetic S650D mutation on the properties of PIPKIÎ³90 was further investigated in living cells. WT, but not mutant (S650D) GFP-PIPKIÎ³90, accumulated at focal adhesions when expressed in NIH3T3 cells (mouse fibroblast), as shown by colocalization with the focal adhesion marker vinculin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). This result demonstrates the inhibitory effect of the presence of an acidic charge at position 650 in the recruitment of PIPKIÎ³90 at focal adhesions, which is consistent with the blocking effect on the interaction with talin. As reported previously, the interaction of talin with PIPKIÎ³90 competes with the interaction of talin with Î² integrin, because both proteins bind to the same surface of talin's F3 domain (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barsukov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liddington et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, pull-downs with a GST fusion protein of integrin Î²<sub>1</sub> tail from lysates of CHO cells transfected with mutant (S650D) or wild-type PIPKIÎ³90 yielded a higher level of talin in the case of cells transfected with the mutant protein, which is not expected to compete (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). Collectively, these results indicate that talin binding is incompatible with the presence of a negative charge at S650 in PIPKIÎ³90 and that S650 phosphorylation has an important role in the regulation of PIPKIÎ³90âtalinâintegrin interactions.</p>
        <p>PIPKIÎ³90 and Î² integrin share amino acid similarity in the talin-binding region. Within these similar sequences, S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 was proposed to functionally replace the asparagine of the sequence NPXY in Î² integrin. When S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 was replaced by an asparagine (S650N), the resulting mutant protein was still able to bind to talin, confirming this prediction. Thus, transfected GFP-PIPKIÎ³90 harboring the S650N mutation colocalized with vinculin at focal adhesions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> F) and coprecipitated with talin from lysates of transfected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> G). The presence of a serine at this position in PIPKIÎ³90, but not in Î² integrin, allows for a differential regulation of the two interactions by phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>If the binding of PIPKIÎ³90 to talin is important for focal adhesion dynamics, overexpression of p35/Cdk5 would be expected to affect focal adhesion dynamics by enhancing the phosphorylation state of S650. Consistent with this prediction, overexpression of p35/Cdk5 in NIH3T3 cells disrupted focal adhesions and stress fibers, as detected by antivinculin immunostaining and phalloidin staining, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

        <p>
<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al. (2003)</xref> reported that the COOH-terminal region of mouse PIPKIÎ³90 undergoes phosphorylation by Src at tyrosine 644 (Y649 of human PIPKIÎ³90) and that this phosphorylation enhances its interaction with talin. Y649 is adjacent to S650 in the talin-binding sequence (WVYSPL), which is identical in mice and humans. The juxtaposition of the two sites raised the possibility that phosphorylation of one might regulate phosphorylation of the other. This possibility was tested using synthetic peptides centered around the talin-binding consensus. Both 12-mer peptides, as well as 17-mer peptides identical to those used by <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al. (2003)</xref>, were tested. First, we revisited the effect of Y649 phosphorylation on talin binding. Surprisingly, an ITC assay did not demonstrate a difference between the affinities of the WT peptides and of the pY649 peptides for GST-talin head (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 654, which is a weak Src target site (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>), also had no positive effect on talin binding, and in fact, it slightly decreased the binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). The pS650 12-mer peptide exhibited negligible binding to talin, as expected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> A and 3 A). In agreement with the results of the ITC assay, the WT peptide (12-mer) and the pY649 peptide (12-mer) equally competed with the tail for talin binding in pull-down assays from rat brain extracts using GSTâ28-aa tail (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>S650 phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90 is regulated by Cdk5 and calcineurin at synapses</title>
        <p>In the next series of experiments, the in vivo phosphorylation of S650 in endogenous PIPKIÎ³90 was investigated. Rat brain synaptosomes, including samples exposed to a 1-h metabolic labeling step with <sup>32</sup>Pi, were incubated for 20 min in control buffer, and then were depolarized for 1 min with high K<sup>+</sup> (55 mM) in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As detected by using <sup>32</sup>P incorporation or by using the pS650 antibody, we found that PIPKIÎ³90 was constitutively phosphorylated at rest, and dephosphorylated upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation, but only in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). The stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation of pS650 was blocked by cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). Furthermore, rephosphorylation of S650 upon reexposure to the control buffer was partially inhibited by incubation with butyrolactone I (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C) or roscovitine (unpublished data). The pattern of PIPKIÎ³90 dephosphorylation was qualitatively similar to that of amphiphysin 2, whose upper band (phospho-form) collapses into lower bands (dephospho form) upon calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bauerfeind et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>).</p>

For other proteins, Western blots were performed directly on synaptosomal lysates. (A) Freshly prepared rat brain synaptosomes, or synaptosomes exposed to a 1-h labeling step with <sup>32</sup>Pi, were incubated for 1 min with either control buffer or stimulation buffer (high K<sup>+</sup>) in the absence or presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bauerfeind et al., 1997</xref>). Anti-PIPKIÎ³90 immunoprecipitates prepared from these samples were analyzed by autoradiography (<sup>32</sup>P-labeled samples) or by Western blotting for pS650 and total PIPKIÎ³90. Western blotting for amphiphysin 2 revealed the previously described stimulation-dependent mobility shift of the upper band (because of its dephosphorylation), thus confirming the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stimulation.

        <p>The only partial effect of Cdk5 inhibitors on the phosphorylation of S650 suggested that other kinases may phosphorylate this site. Interestingly, the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of S650 in resting and stimulated synaptosomes was reminiscent of that of the phosphorylation sites 4 and 5 of synapsin I (corresponding to serine 62 and serine 67, respectively, of rat synapsin I) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jovanovic et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, these sites in synapsin I were found to be phosphorylated by MAPK (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jovanovic et al., 2001</xref>). MAPK is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase whose substrate specificity [(S/T)P] (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Songyang et al., 1996</xref>) overlaps with the substrate preference of Cdk5 and may therefore be involved in S650 phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>The potential involvement of MAPK as well as of phosphatases other than calcineurin in the regulation of S650 phosphorylation was investigated. Synaptosomes were treated with either okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), or PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK1/2 (p42/p44). Okadaic acid alone strongly enhanced the phosphorylation state of S650 both at rest and after high K<sup>+</sup> depolarization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D), although a stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation of S650 still occurred upon exposure to high K<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D, compare the second and fourth lanes). Okadaic acid also increased the level of phospho-MAPK1/2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). This was expected because PP2A is known to dephosphorylate MAPK, with a resulting inhibition of its activity (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alessi et al., 1995</xref>). PD98059 partially prevented the increase in S650 phosphorylation produced by okadaic acid (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> E). The increase of pS650 produced by okadaic acid may result both from a direct inhibition of pS650 dephosphorylation by PP2A and/or indirectly from the enhanced MAPK activity caused by inhibition of PP2A. Note that, as previously reported, depolarization in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the phosphorylation state of MAPK1/2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D, compare the first and third lanes; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>). This is in contrast to the depolarization-dependent dephosphorylation of S650, thus indicating that calcineurin can override the action of MAPK on S650. Consistent with PIPKIÎ³90 being a substrate for MAPK, purified MAPK1 phosphorylated S650 in WT His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 in vitro, but did not phosphorylate S650A mutant His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> F), as determined by anti-p5650 Western blotting.</p>

        <title>S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 undergoes mitotic phosphorylation</title>
        <p>Entry of cells into mitosis is accompanied by massive structural changes. For example, cells grown in culture round up and partially detach from the substrates, a change which correlates with the disruption of focal adhesions (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Maddox and Burridge, 2003</xref>). The property of S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 to function as a substrate for Cdk5, a member of the Cdk family, prompted us to examine its phosphorylation state during mitosis. Disruption of the interaction between talin and PIPKIÎ³90 could be one of the biochemical modifications that correlate with focal adhesion disassembly. CHO cells transfected with WT or mutant HA-PIPKIÎ³90 were either treated with nocodazole to arrest cells in pro-metaphase, or treated with nocodazole and then allowed to progress to G<sub>1</sub> interphase by re-addition of serum. pS650 immunoreactivity was detected only in cells expressing WT PIPKIÎ³90 and phosphorylation was dramatically increased in mitotic cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A). These results were corroborated by the analysis of endogenous PIPKIÎ³90 in cells (U87MG cells, derived from a human astrocytoma) that express high levels of this enzyme. In this case, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PIPKIÎ³90 antibody prior to Western blotting (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B). Not only S650 phosphorylation was strongly stimulated in mitosis, but coprecipitation of talin with the kinase was nearly abolished in the mitotic state. The mitotic synchronization of these cells was validated by Western blotting of total lysates with antibodies directed against phospho-histone H3, a marker of mitosis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ajiro et al., 1996</xref>). In support of a role for cyclin-activated kinases in the phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90 during mitosis, purified cyclin B1âCdk1 complex phosphorylated purified WT His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 in vitro but weakly phosphorylated its S650A mutant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C). Cyclin B1, a physiological substrate of Cdk1 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Borgne et al., 1999</xref>), was phosphorylated at roughly similar levels in both samples (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We and others have recently identified an interaction between talin and PIPKIÎ³90 that plays an important role at synapses and focal adhesions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>). This interaction is thought to control the synthesis of specific pools of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at these sites, but has an additional impact on adhesion. PIPKIÎ³90 competes with the binding of integrin to talin and can, therefore, transdominantly inhibit integrin activation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barsukov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the binding of PIPKIÎ³90 to talin must be highly regulated. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al. (2003)</xref> suggested one mechanism for positive regulation as being the Src-dependent phosphorylation of Y649 within the talin-binding sequence WVYSPL. We have now identified and characterized another mechanism, phosphorylation of S650, that negatively regulates the talinâPIPKIÎ³90 interaction and that is the point of convergence of multiple signaling pathways. In addition, our results suggest that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Y649 likely acts indirectly on talin binding, rather than directly, as previously proposed (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>At synapses, the generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by PIPKIÎ³ is thought to play an important regulatory role both in exocytosis and in endocytosis (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wenk and De Camilli, 2004</xref>). The initial goal of this study was to determine whether PIPKIÎ³90, like several other synaptic proteins that participate in synaptic vesicle traffic, primarily endocytic traffic (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bauerfeind et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tomizawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), is regulated by the serine/threonine phosphorylation. We have now demonstrated that PIPKIÎ³90 is efficiently phosphorylated at S650 by Cdk5 both in vitro and in vivo, and that this Cdk5 site is dephosphorylated by calcineurin. Importantly, we have shown that phosphorylation of this site negatively regulates the talinâPIPKIÎ³90 interaction. Such an interaction is vital for synaptic physiology, because its perturbation by peptides microinjected into giant axons perturbs synaptic vesicle recycling and the dynamics of presynaptic actin (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>). Restoration of the interaction by depolarization-triggered dephosphorylation may serve to recruit and activate PIPKIÎ³90 at sites of exo-endocytosis and may underlie, together with interaction of PIPKIÎ³90 with small GTPases (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aikawa and Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>), the increase in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis occurring in stimulated synaptosomes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, in preliminary experiments, we have found that a guanyl nucleotideâindependent interaction of PIPKIÎ³90 with Rac1 is also inhibited by Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation at a site distinct from S650 (unpublished data). These findings support a model according to which Cdk5 phosphorylation keeps the synapse in a âresting mode,â whereas calcineurin triggers an âactive modeâ (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sahin and Bibb, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that phosphorylation of S650 may also be regulated by other proline-directed kinases and at least one other phosphatase. A potential role of MAPK can be inferred from the inhibitory action of the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 on the levels of pS650 in vivo and from the in vitro phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90 by purified MAPK1. The powerful stimulatory effect of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the PP2A (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jovanovic et al., 2001</xref>), on the levels of pS650 is also consistent with an action of MAPK, because PP2A could act indirectly by dephosphorylating and, therefore, inhibiting MAPK (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alessi et al., 1995</xref>). In the presence of okadaic acid, such activity would be greatly stimulated. Additionally, PP2A may act directly on pS650. If this is the case, the large increase of pS650 observed in the presence of okadaic acid in unstimulated synaptosomes would indicate the occurrence of a very rapid turnover of phosphate on S650 even at rest. Among the questions that remain to be addressed is whether different kinases and phosphatases act on pools of PIPKIÎ³90 with distinct subcellular localization, because PIPKIÎ³90 is concentrated in, but not restricted to, nerve terminals. However, important conclusions from this study are that S650 represents the point of convergence of different regulatory pathways and that its state of phosphorylation controls an important targeting and activation mechanism of this enzyme.</p>
      <p>Cdk5 phosphorylation was found to have only a negligible (positive) effect on the catalytic activity of PIPKIÎ³90 (unpublished data). Because Cdk5 also phosphorylated PIPKIÎ³87 and slightly activated its catalytic activity (unpublished data), S650 does not seem to participate in this regulation. However, it is possible, that sites phosphorylated by other kinases may directly control its catalytic activity. An inhibitory role on PIPKIÎ³ activity produced by protein kinase A phosphorylation at serine 264 (human sequence) was previously suggested, based on studies of the homologous mouse PIPKIÎ± (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2001</xref>). The precise coordination of different phosphorylation reactions remains to be investigated.</p>
      <p>Our study also shows that S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 can undergo phosphorylation in nonneuronal cells, where PIPKIÎ³90 is primarily localized at focal adhesions. However, although transfected Cdk5âa protein kinase expressed predominantly, but not exclusively, in neurons (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dhavan and Tsai, 2001</xref>)âcan phosphorylate transfected PIPKIÎ³90 in CHO cells, the protein kinase that performs this phosphorylation reaction physiologically in interphase nonneuronal cells remains to be identified. As suggested by the phosphomimetic S650D mutant, phosphorylation of S650 prevents the localization of PIPKIÎ³90 at focal adhesions. In addition, the S650D mutant of PIPKIÎ³90 did not compete with the interaction of talin and Î² integrin. Therefore, one can expect that regulation of the turnover of phosphate on S650 may have a key role in the regulation of the balance between adhesion and motility (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood and Ginsberg, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carragher and Frame, 2004</xref>). It is of interest, in this context, that Cdk5 plays a major role in the regulation of cell migration and neurite outgrowth in the nervous system (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dhavan and Tsai, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2003</xref>) and of cell adhesion and migration in nonneuronal cells (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2002</xref>). As we have shown here, its overexpression strongly affects focal adhesion.</p>
      <p>As we also show here, S650 of PIPKIÎ³90 undergoes phosphorylation in mitosis and is a very good in vitro, and a likely in vivo, substrate for the cyclin B1âCdk1 complex. It will be of interest to determine whether phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90 at S650 helps drive focal adhesion disassembly during mitosis, or simply correlates with this process. We note that other proteins implicated in membrane traffic at synapses are also physiological substrates for both cyclin B1/Cdk1 and p35/Cdk5. These include epsin, Eps15, and amphiphysin (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Floyd et al., 2001</xref>). Mechanisms that regulate entry into the mitotic state, where much of the exo-endocytic traffic is blocked (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Pypaert et al., 1991</xref>), may be closely related to mechanisms that limit exo-endocytic traffic at neuronal synapses at rest.</p>
      <p>At variance with what was reported previously (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>), studies with purified peptides, including the same peptides used by <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al. (2003)</xref>, did not reveal an effect of Y649 phosphorylation on the interaction of PIPKIÎ³90 with talin. Furthermore, structural data indicate that phosphorylation of Y649 would be unlikely to directly perturb the interaction between these two proteins (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liddington et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Pereda et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the negative effect of S650 phosphorylation on the interaction of PIPKIÎ³90 with talin is consistent with structural predictions pointing to an intimate interaction of S650 with talin (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liddington et al., 2003</xref>) and with the mutagenesis experiments reported here.</p>
      <p>However, we did find that the presence of phosphate on Y649 strongly inhibits the phosphorylation of S650, and vice versa. Thus, Src-dependent phosphorylation of Y649 may act indirectly to enhance talin binding by inhibiting phosphorylation of S650. Conversely, in addition to directly blocking the interaction with talin, phosphorylation of S650, in a feed-forward mechanism, blocks the phosphorylation reaction at Y649 that inhibits S650 phosphorylation. Src family kinases have been implicated both in synaptic function and in focal adhesion dynamics (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Purcell and Carew, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carragher and Frame, 2004</xref>), thus supporting a physiological significance of this bidirectional control of PIPKIÎ³90.</p>
      <p>While our manuscript was in review, a study by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Pereda et al. (2004)</xref> reported a crystallographic analysis of the interaction between the F3 subdomain of talin and the COOH-terminal tail of mouse PIPKIÎ³. The structure is consistent with the results of our phosphorylation studies. It predicts that phosphorylation of serine 650 of human PIPKIÎ³90 would block the interaction, and explains the lack of effect that we report here for the phosphorylation of tyrosine 649. Dissociation constant values determined by ITC for the talinâPIPKIÎ³90 peptide interaction in this new study (see Fig. S1 in <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Pereda et al., 2004</xref>) are in the same range of those reported by us and show only a minor (1.6-fold) positive effect of phosphorylation of tyrosine 644, which corresponds to human tyrosine 649, on the interaction (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Pereda et al., 2004</xref>). Overall, these new findings are in very good agreement with our results.</p>

Purified GST-PIPKIÎ³90 or His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKÎ³87/90 fusion proteins (200â300 ng) were incubated with p35âCdk5 complex (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) or cyclin B1âCdk1 complex (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>) at an â¼1:1 stoichiometric ratio in the presence of 10 Î¼Ci Î³-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (1 Ci = 37 GBq) for up to 30 min at 30<sup>o</sup>C. PIPKIÎ³90 phosphorylation by MAPK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Kinase reactions (30â40 Î¼l final volume) were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In case of peptide phosphorylation by c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology) and p35/Cdk5, each kinase was mixed with the 12-mer peptides (each 25 Î¼M) in the presence of 400 Î¼M ATP and 40 Î¼Ci Î³-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. c-Src phosphorylation was performed in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 62.5 Î¼M Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and p35/Cdk5 phosphorylation was assayed as described above.

The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and detected by Cerenkov counting. Peptide masses containing a phosphate group were determined by MALDI/MS, and the phosphorylation sites were confirmed by further radio sequencing of the peptides. 2-D phosphopeptide mapping was performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh-Wilson et al., 2003</xref>). In brief, after centrifugation of the trypsin-digested radiolabeled material, supernatants were collected and lyophilized. Pellets were then washed with distilled water and running buffer (10% acetic acid and 1% pyridine in water) several times. Lyophilized pellets were dissolved in running buffer and spotted onto cellulose TLC plates. The plates were sequentially subjected to electrophoresis in the running buffer, pH 3.5, at 400 V, and then to chromatography in a buffer (25% 1-butanol, 7.5% acetic acid, and 37.5% pyridine in water).

Membranes were blotted with anti-GST antibody. For the pull-down assay from rat brain extracts, His<sub>6</sub>-PIPKIÎ³90 fusion proteins (4â5 Î¼g) coupled to Talon metal affinity beads in TBS containing 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 were mixed with rat brain extracts (6.4 mg) prepared in buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4<sup>o</sup>C. ITC measurements were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter equipped with a PC running VPViewer software. Dissociation constant values were obtained from the data collected automatically and analyzed with Origin software. In each experiment, 3-Î¼l aliquots of peptide solution (1 mM) were injected into a calorimetric cell preloaded with 1.4267 ml GST-talin head domain (16.4 Î¼M) using a rotating stirrer syringe (250-Î¼l vol) every 250 s at 37Â°C. All solutions included 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl and were degassed. To estimate a blank heat effect associated with dilution and mechanical phenomena, peptide injections were performed after saturation of binding.</p>

In brief, 200-Î¼l aliquots of synaptosomes were preincubated in the âcontrol bufferâ with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 20 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C, and then diluted with an equal volume of either control buffer or stimulation buffer containing high K<sup>+</sup>. When inhibitors of protein kinases and phosphatases were used, the inhibitors were present during both the preincubation and the stimulation steps. For analysis of total phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³90, synaptosomes were labeled with 2 mCi/ml Î³-[<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate for 1 h prior to the preincubation. After a 1-min stimulation, 100 Î¼l of buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100 [vol/vol]) supplemented with 10% SDS (final 2% SDS) was directly added to synaptosomes for lysis and incubation mixtures were boiled for 10 min. For repolarization, synaptosomes stimulated by high K<sup>+</sup> were rapidly harvested, resuspended in control buffer, and were further incubated for 15 min before lysis. For PIPKIÎ³90 immunoprecipitation, synaptosomal lysates were diluted with 9 vol of the buffer B and added to protein AâSepharose beads precoated with anti-PIPKIÎ³90 antibody for 2 h at 4<sup>o</sup>C.
