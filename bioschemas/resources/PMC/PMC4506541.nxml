        <p>The proteasome is a highly regulated protease complex fundamental for cell homeostasis and controlled cell cycle progression. It functions by removing a wide range of specifically tagged proteins, including key cellular regulators. Here we present the structure of the human 20S proteasome core bound to a substrate analogue inhibitor molecule, determined by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle analysis at a resolution of around 3.5âÃ. Our map allows the building of protein coordinates as well as defining the location and conformation of the inhibitor at the different active sites. These results open new prospects to tackle the proteasome functional mechanisms. Moreover, they also further demonstrate that cryo-EM is emerging as a realistic approach for general structural studies of proteinâligand interactions.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The proteasome comprises a 20S proteolytic core that in eukaryotes is formed from seven Î± and seven Î² subunits arranged in pseudo-seven-fold rings, two copies of which stack into a barrel shaped Î±<sub>7</sub>Î²<sub>7</sub>Î²<sub>7</sub>Î±<sub>7</sub> assembly of about 750âkDa. The proteolytic active sites correspond to the amino-terminal (N-terminal) Thr residues of the mature Î²1, Î²2 and Î²5 subunits. Each of the active sites has distinct specificities, and variants of these are found in the interferon Î³ induced immunoproteasome, where the active subunits are replaced by their Î²i variants. Likewise, variants are also found in cortical thymic epithelial cells, where the Î²t5 thymoproteasome subunit is expressed. The crystal structure of a 20S proteasome core was first described for an archaeal counterpart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and subsequently determined for yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and constitutive bovine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> complexes. More recently, the crystal structures of both constitutive and immunoproteasome 20S cores from mouse have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These structures revealed the proteolytic sites enclosed within an inner chamber with very restricted access. Accordingly, the 20S core has limited proteolytic activity against smaller peptides and unfolded proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and full activation requires the binding of regulatory complexes to the Î± rings at the ends of the barrel shaped core. Such regulatory complexes include the 19S regulatory particles, which bind to the 20S core to form the 26S proteasome and recruit fully folded protein substrates specifically tagged for degradation by ubiquitination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
    <p>The proteasome is a well-established target for cancer therapy due to its critical role in the highly regulated removal of cell cycle regulators and to its inhibition leading to apoptosis, primarily of fast proliferating cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Bortezomid was the first inhibitor of the 20S core proteolytic activity to be approved for therapeutic usage against multiple myeloma, and a second-generation inhibitor, carfilzomib, is now used in the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition to the development of better anticancer drugs, proteasome inhibitors are being explored for other therapeutic usages including as anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents. However, due to the potential cytotoxic effects associated with 20S core inhibition, there is a great demand for the development of inhibitors with higher specificity. X-ray crystallography has been critical in determining the modes of interaction of inhibitors with the 20S core and to help the rational design of better therapeutic drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, these studies require co-crystallization of protein in the presence of inhibitor or soaking preformed protein crystals in an inhibitor containing solution. In either case, the experimental conditions must preserve the integrity of the protein crystals. These are not always ideal for the proteinâligand interactions and imply ligand binding under a non-physiological environment, where ligand accessibility may be modulated by steric restraints imposed by crystal contacts. With recent developments in the field of structural electron microscopy, including the availability of direct electron detectors, it is now possible to determine the structure of protein complexes by cryo-EM and single-particle analysis at resolutions that until recently have been attained only by crystallography or NMR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Here we explore the use of cryo-EM as an emerging tool for the study of proteinâligand interactions, focusing on the structure of the human 20S proteasome core bound to an inhibitor.</p>

        <title>Cryo-EM structure of human 20S core with an inhibitor bound</title>
        <p>We determined the structure of the human 20S proteasome core bound to the inhibitor adamantaneacetyl-(6-aminohexanoyl)<sub>3</sub>-(leucyl)<sub>3</sub>-vinylmethyl-sulfone (AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> by cryo-EM and single-particle analysis. The high quality of the final map can be effectively appreciated when viewed as individual sections 1âÃ thick in grey-scale representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Here protein density clearly stands out against a very smooth and clean background. Furthermore, close inspection allows immediate identification of the twist of Î±-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and reveals the clear separation of sheet forming Î²-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). It should be noted that the map displayed in this way is obtained directly from the reconstitution algorithm, with no further filtering, sharpening or masking. In agreement with the clear recovery of structural detail in the grey-scale sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), the map allows unambiguous identification of the protein backbone. The model of the human 20S proteasome core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) was built based on the crystal structure of the mouse constitutive apo 20S core<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. It reveals a conformational rearrangement from the starting model to the final human 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS complex resembling that previously described between the structure of apo and ligand bound 20S core complexes determined by X-ray crystallography<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The final human 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS model was checked for geometry, close contacts and bond parameters using MolProbity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The quality of the model serves as clear indication that during its building there is no over fitting into noise in the EM map, as this would readily lead to poor MolProbity statistics. The resolution of the cryo-EM map can therefore be assessed by Fourier shell correlation against a density map generated from the coordinates of the molecular model yielding a value of about 3.5âÃ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Furthermore, an estimate of local resolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> assigns the majority of the map voxels to a 3.3â3.8âÃ resolution range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), which is consistent with the level of detail observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). In agreement with the resolution estimate, the map of the human 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS complex shows good resolution of most side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), with a better resolution observed in the protein interior where they are stabilized by intraprotein contacts and steric restrains. The reduced visibility of side chains at the protein surface appears to be related to solvent exposure rather than distortions due to contacts with the support carbon or with the air water interface, as similar effects are observed for exposed residues both at the outer surface and in the solvent filled interior cavities of the 20S core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Conformation of AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS at the different active sites</title>
        <p>AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) is a highly potent proteasome inhibitor that irreversibly binds all the 20S core proteolytic active sites and can be modified to serve as a proteasome label and as a reporter of proteasome inhibition both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The vinyl sulfone class of 20S core inhibitors act by covalently modifying the proteolytic active N-terminal Thr residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In the cryo-EM map of the 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS complex, densities are clearly recovered extending from the catalytically active residues of the Î²1, Î²2 and Î²5 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3bâe</xref>), with no analogous densities visible at the non-proteolytic subunits. In each case, this density is flanked by the loop between the Î² strands S2 and S3 and that linking the Î² strand S4 and the Î± helix H1 of the respective active subunit, in a similar manner to other 20S core inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The density extending from the N terminus of the Î²5 subunit can be used to unambiguously build the L<sub>3</sub>VS moiety of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Here the vinyl sulfone group and the three leucine side chains are clearly resolved and arranged on alternate sides of the backbone in an extended near planar conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). The remaining Ada and linker components of the inhibitor are only partially resolved, most likely due to conformational variability, and were therefore not modelled. The density extending from the N terminus of the Î²2 subunit is also consistent with an extended near planar conformation of the L<sub>3</sub>VS groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Here, however, while the densities for the vinyl sulfone group and peptide backbone are well recovered, only partial density is found for the leucine side chains. A similar interpretation of the density extending from the N terminus of Î²1 can be made, although this is the least defined of the three inhibitor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Better visibility of the inhibitor densities at the Î²5 active site suggests higher occupancy compared with the Î²1 and Î²2 subunits. Accordingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using purified mammalian 20S cores revealed that AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS inhibits the chymotryptic activity associated with the Î²5 subunit with higher potency than the activities associated with the Î²1 and Î²2 subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We present the structure determined by cryo-EM of the human 20S proteasome core bound to an inhibitor (AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS), at a resolution of about 3.5âÃÃ, in which the protein backbone of each of its subunits is clearly identified as well as most of the side chains. Within the structure, AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS is clearly identified bound to each of the proteolytic sites of the 20S core. These results can be compared with recent structures of the archaeal apo 20S proteasome core, also determined by cryo-EM and single-particle analysis at resolutions of 3.3âÃ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and 2.8âÃ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Although related, the archaeal and the eukaryotic 20S proteasome cores differ substantially in their level of complexity. The archaeal 20S core is a D7 structure made up of seven-fold symmetric rings of homoâheptameric Î± and Î² subunits. The resulting 14-fold symmetry of this complex and its stability make it a very good model protein complex to test cryo-EM and image analysis procedures, due to the potential for symmetry-based averaging. In contrast, the eukaryotic 20S core has seven distinct Î± and Î² subunits. It conforms to lower C2 symmetry and, accordingly, the scope for internal averaging is reduced by a factor of 7. Furthermore, since in the archaeal 20S proteasome core all proteolytic active sites are identical, the analysis of this complex offers limited scope to explore and understand the selective targeting of the three individual proteolytic activities of the human 20S core complex. Consequently, the analysis of the archaeal complex in the presence of inhibitors would have substantially less relevance to drug development than the analysis of eukaryotic complexes. More broadly, the nature of the human 20S core is much more typical of a protein drug target, the majority of which conform to low symmetries, making it a good example to demonstrate the emerging potential of cryo-EM and single-particle analysis for the study of proteinâligand interactions and for structure-based drug design.</p>
      <p>Structure-based drug design has been extensively used for the development of improved 20S core inhibitors and until now these studies involved X-ray crystallography of 20S-inhibitor complexes. The closest of these inhibitors to the AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS used here is carboxybenzyl-(leucyl)<sub>3</sub>-vinyl-sulfone (ZL<sub>3</sub>VS), which was recently found binding only to the Î²5 subunit in a structure of the yeast 20S core<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Both compounds share the proteasome active site binding L<sub>3</sub>VS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). By superimposing the structure of the ZL<sub>3</sub>VS bound to the yeast 20S core onto that of the AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS bound to the human complex, it is clear that both share a similar binding conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The densities extending from the N terminus of the Î²1 and Î²2 subunits of the human complex also indicate an extended conformation of the L<sub>3</sub>VS motif of the inhibitor, and their arrangement stacked within corresponding adjacent loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>) seems to indicate a similar binding conformation of the L<sub>3</sub>VS motif at all three of the 20S core active sites. Furthermore, while in the yeast 20SâZL<sub>3</sub>VS complex ZL<sub>3</sub>VS was found binding only to the Î²5 subunit, biochemical studies have shown that ZL<sub>3</sub>VS inhibits all three proteolytic activities of the 20S core. However, a somewhat stronger inhibition was observed for the chymotryptic activity of the Î²5 subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The crystals of the yeast 20SâZL<sub>3</sub>VS complex were obtained by soaking preformed protein crystals with an inhibitor solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, under conditions that must preserve the crystals' integrity. However, for activity studies, proteasome samples are incubated in solution at 37âÂ°C in the presence of inhibitor, under optimal conditions for proteinâligand interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This seems to indicate that the absence of inhibitor at the Î²1 and Î²2 active sites in the crystal structure of the yeast 20SâZL<sub>3</sub>VS complex may be a consequence of the experimental conditions used. On the other hand, in the closer to physiological conditions used for the cryo-EM sample preparation presented here, where the human 20S core was incubated in solution in the presence of AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS for 1âh at 37âÂ°C, the inhibitor binds to all three of the active sites in a manner consistent with the results obtained from the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity studies using purified 20S core<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
      <p>Overall, our results illustrate the emerging potential of using cryo-EM and single-particle analysis to study the proteinâligand interactions and structure-based drug design, while opening new opportunities for the study of detailed protein functional mechanisms. Together with the recent report of the structure of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> 80S ribosome bound to an anti-protozoan drug<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we show that cryo-EM can be used to visualize small ligands bound to protein complexes. Moreover, the results presented here also demonstrate the advantages of using cryo-EM for such studies, with results consistent with activity assays, as it allows the analysis of complexes rapidly frozen from solution and thus under conditions closer to physiological compared with other methods of structural determination.</p>

        <p>The human 20S proteasome core sample and AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. The 20S proteasome core was diluted in 50âmM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1âmM dithiotreitol to a concentration of 0.14âÎ¼M (0.1âmgâml<sup>â1</sup>) and incubated in the presence of 10âÎ¼M AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS for 1âh at 37âÂ°C.</p>

        <title>Cryo-EM</title>
        <p>Samples were applied onto thin layers of carbon freshly floated from mica and supported by 1.2/1.3 Quantifoil electron microscope grids. They were then flash frozen by plunging into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI), operated at 22âÂ°C and 95% humidity, with a 2.5âs blot time. During their preparation, the grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharging. It was observed that the glow discharging of the grids in air causes the 20S proteasome core to orient predominantly with its long axis perpendicular to the support carbon. To get the random side views required for data completeness in the three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, it was necessary to glow discharge the grids in the presence of pentylamine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The grids were transferred into a FEI Titan Krios microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 300âkeV, a nominal magnification of Ã 75,000 (yielding a calibrated sampling of 1.04âÃ per pixel at the image level) and a range of 1.7â3.0âÎ¼m underfocus. Images were recorded with EPU software using a Falcon II direct electron detector, with 1âs exposure time, giving 17 individual frames captured at a rate of 0.056âs per frame and each corresponding to an electron dose of 2.8âe<sup>â</sup>âÃ<sup>â2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Image processing</title>
        <p>The strategy for image processing was based on that previously described for the structure of the human 26S proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, but taking advantage of the new instrumentation and image recording protocol. For each exposure, the sum of all frames captured was used to carefully screen for optimal ice thickness and image stability by assessing the isotropic recovery of Thon rings in their power spectra. The power spectra of the images selected for analysis had isotropic Thon rings directly observed to 4âÃ or better. Using these criteria, 720 images were selected for further processing from a total of 960 exposures recorded, all of these acquired from a single cryo-EM grid and during a single cryo-EM session. The sum of all frames recorded for each of the exposures selected for further processing was also used to determine the image defocus and astigmatism parameters, using the Tigris programme findctf, and for particle selection, which was performed automatically in Relion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This was followed by careful inspection of all particles selected and manual removal of false positives and addition of false negatives, resulting in a data set of 76,500 particles. Further image processing was done using the sum of frames 3â10 of each exposure, corresponding to a total accumulated electron dose of 28âe<sup>â</sup>âÃ<sup>â2</sup>. This selection aimed at maximum specimen stability and optimal signal-to-noise in the resulting images for accurate determination of the particle orientations, while avoiding excessive radiation damage. In this selection, the first two frames captured during exposure, corresponding to the initial accumulated dose of 5.6âe<sup>â</sup>âÃ<sup>â2</sup>, were excluded as it is at the start of the exposure that the most prominent beam induced particle movements are observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. As a consequence of our data collection protocol, for each exposure the selection of recorded frames used for high-resolution analysis was effectively acquired within 0.45âs. Within this short time, the individual particle images showed negligible translational displacement and hence it was not judged necessary to further align these frames. The phases of the resulting images were corrected for the contrast transfer function by phase flipping with the Tigris programme flipctf, using the image defocus and astigmatism parameters determined using the full exposures as described above. Selected particle images were then extracted into 256 Ã 256 pixel boxes. A model derived from the coordinates of the bovine constitutive apo 20S proteasome core, as fitted into the 3D map of the human 26S proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and Fourier low-pass filtered to 20âÃ, was used as an initial reference for single-particle analysis of the human 20S proteasome core in the apo state (data not shown). The resulting map, again low-pass filtered to 20âÃ, was used as a starting reference for the analysis of the human 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS complex. The single-particle analysis refinement routine, performed using C2 symmetry, consisted of rounds of alignment and Euler angle assignment using the programme AP SH of the Spider software package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, 3D reconstruction and forward projection. 3D reconstructions and forward projections were performed using the locally developed icr3d and icr3dpro programs implemented in Tigris. The 3D reconstruction algorithm included correction for the amplitude component of the contrast transfer function. The Tigris software package is publicly available at sourceforge.net. The surface representations of the final map, as determined by the 3D reconstruction algorithm without further sharpening, Fourier filtering or masking, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref> were created with UCSF Chimera<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. They were surface rendered and colour coded according to local resolution as determined by ResMap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>

        <title>Molecular modelling</title>
        <p>The model of the human 20S proteasome core was built based on the X-ray crystal structure of the mouse constitutive apo 20S proteasome core<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> using real-space refinement in Coot<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and Phenix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The model generated in this way was checked for geometry, close contacts and bond parameters using MolProbity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), with the statistics obtained consistent with those for models determined by X-ray crystallography at similar resolutions. At the stage of model building, the scaling of the 3D map of the human 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS complex was tested, and model building using a sampling of 1.04âÃ per pixel resulted in the most favourable protein coordinate MolProbity scores, indicating accuracy in the sampling used. Models for the individual copies of the -L<sub>3</sub>VS moiety of the AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS molecule, at each of the 20S proteasome core active sites, were built in using Coot. The mesh representations of the final map showing the model of the human 20S proteasome core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>) were created using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. For these representations, the map was sharpened with a B-factor of â50 and Fourier low-pass filtered to 3.4âÃ.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structural formula of the inhibitor AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS. The map of the human 20SâAdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS complex, Fourier low-pass filtered to 3.4âÃ, is shown as a mesh (<bold>b</bold>â<bold>e</bold>). Clear densities are seen extending from the N-terminal Thr residues of the Î²5 (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>), Î²2 (<bold>d</bold>) and Î²1 (<bold>e</bold>) subunits that are consistent with the -L<sub>3</sub>VS moiety of the AdaAhx<sub>3</sub>L<sub>3</sub>VS molecule, with the vinyl sulfone group and the side chains of the three leucine residues shown clearly resolved at the Î²5 site (<bold>c</bold>).</p>
