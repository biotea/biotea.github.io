      <abstract>
        <p>PLAA (ortholog of yeast Doa1/Ufd3, also know as human PLAP or <underline>p</underline>hospho<underline>l</underline>ipase <underline>A</underline>2-<underline>a</underline>ctivating protein) has been implicated in a variety of disparate biological processes that involve the ubiquitin system. It is linked to the maintenance of ubiquitin levels, but the mechanism by which it accomplishes this is unclear. The C-terminal PUL (<underline>P</underline>LAP, <underline>U</underline>fd3p, and <underline>L</underline>ub1p) domain of PLAA binds p97, an AAA ATPase, which among other functions helps transfer ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. In yeast, loss of Doa1 is suppressed by altering p97/Cdc48 function indicating that physical interaction between PLAA and p97 is functionally important. Although the overall regions of interaction between these proteins are known, the structural basis has been unavailable. We solved the high resolution crystal structure of the p97-PLAA complex showing that the PUL domain forms a 6-mer Armadillo-containing domain. Its N-terminal extension folds back onto the inner curvature forming a deep ridge that is positively charged with residues that are phylogenetically conserved. The C terminus of p97 binds in this ridge, where the side chain of p97-Tyr<sup>805</sup>, implicated in phosphorylation-dependent regulation, is buried. Expressed in <italic>doa1</italic>Î null cells, point mutants of the yeast ortholog Doa1 that disrupt this interaction display slightly reduced ubiquitin levels, but unlike <italic>doa1</italic>Î null cells, showed only some of the growth phenotypes. These data suggest that the p97-PLAA interaction is important for a subset of PLAA-dependent biological processes and provides a framework to better understand the role of these complex molecules in the ubiquitin system.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cdc48/p97 is a hexameric AAA ATPase involved in many ubiquitin (Ub)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref>-dependent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). As with other AAA ATPases such as Vps4 and NSF, p97 disrupts protein complexes with its segregase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This activity is important for liberating denatured proteins undergoing endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation from the ER membrane and conveying them to the proteasome. p97 fulfills this and other functions by associating with a variety of accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), some of which such as the E3 ligase Ufd2, the deubiquitinating enzyme Otu1, or the deglycosylating enzyme PNGase, can modify substrates. Other factors act as adaptors to recognize ubiquitinated substrates via distinct Ub binding domains. Exactly how p97 is properly programmed with the correct accessory proteins is not yet clear; however, different regions of p97 mediate binding to distinct sets of accessory proteins, some of them in mutually exclusive configurations. For example, the Ufd1-Npl4 complex, the Ubx family, and the Otu1 peptidase associate with the N-terminal domain of p97; Ufd2, Doa1/PLAA, and PNGase associate with the C terminus of p97. PNGase binds the C terminus of p97 via a PUB domain, which is found in a variety of other proteins that likely add functionality to p97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In the case of Ufd2 and Doa1, each of these factors can compete for binding, which results in hexameric Cdc48-p97 complexes containing either Doa1 or Ufd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that the distal C terminus of p97 can be tyrosine-phosphorylated thus offering a potential way to regulate association with this subset of adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Interestingly, this is one of the most phosphorylated sites in proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The p97 accessory protein PLAA and its yeast homolog, Doa1/Ufd3, possess three conserved domains, including a seven-bladed WD40 Î²-propeller of unknown function, a central PFU domain that binds Ub, and a C-terminal PUL (<underline>P</underline>LAP, <underline>U</underline>fd3p, and <underline>L</underline>ub1p) domain previously shown to mediate binding to Cdc48/p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The PUL domain was originally defined as a conserved portion in orthologs PLAA, Doa1, and Lub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Loss of Doa1 results in a broad range of defects that can be largely traced to loss of Ub levels because overexpression of Ub suppresses the growth defects and some other phenotypes of <italic>doa1</italic>Î null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18"/>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). How the levels of Ub are maintained by Doa1 is unclear, although genetic studies indicate that the function of Doa1 is antagonized by Ufd2 because loss of Ufd2 also suppresses some of the growth defects of Doa1 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Doa1 has been shown to have distinct functions that are independent of its effect on Ub levels. This includes a role in sorting ubiquitinated proteins into the vacuolar/lysosomal lumen via the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). It is not clear whether any or all of Doa1 functions require association with Cdc48, although loss of the entire PUL domain that mediates association ablates all Doa1 function in yeast. Here, we show with structure/function studies that Doa1 has functions both dependent and independent of its association with Cdc48/p97. These data show that although Doa1 performs some of its functions with Cdc48, it also has a distinct set of functions that do not require association. Furthermore, our data suggest the existence of other factors besides Doa1 and Ufd2 that interact with the C terminus of Cdc48 that are important for Cdc48 function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Expression and Purification of PUL Domain</title><p>The PUL domain of PLAA (residues 454â738) was cloned from a Mammalian Gene Collection cDNA template (AT56-D1) into the pET28-LIC vector (GenBank<sup>TM</sup> accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EF456735">EF456735</ext-link>).

A peptide corresponding to the last 10 residues of the C terminus of p97 protein (TEDNDDDLYG) was synthesized, N-terminally labeled with fluorescein, and purified by Tufts University Core Services (Boston). Binding assays were performed in a 10-Î¼l volume at a constant labeled peptide concentration (30 n<sc>m</sc>) by titrating the PLAA C-terminal PUL domain (residues 454â738) and the central PLAA PFU domain (residues 281â408) (at concentrations ranging from low to high) into 50 m<sc>m</sc> Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. A maximum fluorescence polarization of about 250 millipolarization units was detected upon binding of the PUL domain to the labeled peptide, whereas typically about 90â100 millipolarization units was detected for free labeled peptide.

The interaction is limited to only two residues of p97. The p97 side chains of Leu<sup>804</sup> and Tyr<sup>805</sup> point into this pocket, where Asp<sup>615</sup> and Leu<sup>658</sup> form the floor, and Asn<sup>547</sup>, Gln<sup>550</sup>, Ile<sup>551</sup>, Lys<sup>554</sup>, Phe<sup>611</sup>, Arg<sup>661</sup>, Leu<sup>657</sup>, Ala<sup>654</sup>, and Asn<sup>697</sup> form the walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>).

But although the terminal Gly<sup>806</sup> is mostly disordered in PUL structures, it appears capped in PUB, being involved in an ionic bond with an arginine and hydrogen bond with an asparagine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These differences suggest that unlike the PUB domain, the PUL domain can also bind non-terminal, or internal, LYG motifs. The larger number of hydrogen bonds between the p97 peptide and the PUB domain (eight compared with only one in the PUL domain) is consistent with the estimated 1 order of magnitude greater affinity compared with the PUL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Although the p97 pocket is hydrophobic, the neighboring ridge in the PUL domain is marked by a positively charged stretch that extends about 40 â«across the concave inner surface, contributed by one basic residue from each of the ARM helix-3 helices. Interestingly, the channel formed by the inner groove is composed of the most conserved residues of the domain. Together, these observations strongly suggest that the PUL domain has evolved to bind peptide ligands that extended beyond the p97 peptide-binding pocket and that are significantly negatively charged. Although acidic, the majority of the added p97 peptide other than the terminal LYG segment was disordered. Crystal contacts are not within the vicinity of the positively charged ridge in the PUL domain. Together, these observations suggest that the PUL domain may have ligands other than p97. Moreover, the PUL domain unlikely functions in a role similar to importin-like proteins, which usually bind positively charged nuclear localization signal motifs.</p></sec><sec><title>Site-specific Mutations</title><p>We sought to better understand the molecular functions and biological role of PLAA by testing the consequence of disrupting the interaction between the yeast orthologs of PLAA and p97, Doa1, and Cdc48, respectively.

Remarkably, <italic>doa1</italic><sup>ÎCdc48</sup> cells showed a set of phenotypes very distinct from <italic>doa1</italic>Î null cells. In particular, growth on EDTA, caffeine, cadmium, and cycloheximide and growth at 37 Â°C were normal in <italic>cdc48</italic><sup>ÎCterm</sup> cells confirming that the functions that Doa1 provides for growth under these conditions does not require association with Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Here again, the phenotype of the <italic>cdc48</italic><sup>ÎC-term</sup> was distinct from the <italic>doa1Î ufd2</italic>Î double mutants indicating that the function of Doa1 and Ufd2 can be uncoupled from Cdc48. This was clearly seen with growth on ADCB and canavanine, where the <italic>cdc48</italic><sup>ÎC-term</sup> cells showed defective growth, although the <italic>doa1Î ufd2</italic>Î cells showed robust growth.</p><p>Our previous experiments with Doa1 demonstrated a role in MVB sorting that was independent of the effect of Doa1 on ubiquitin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We speculated that Doa1 fulfilled this role by acting in concert with Cdc48. In particular, we found that the sorting of a large membrane protein complex, the vacuolar ATPase tagged with Ub using a Vph1-GFP-Ub fusion, was defective in delivery to the vacuole lumen. These studies demonstrated a unique and more direct role for Doa1 and provided the possibility that a Doa1-Cdc48 complex was required to break apart ubiquitinated membrane protein complexes prior to their sorting into the MVB pathway. Based on our structural understanding of the Doa1-Cdc48 interaction, we tested this idea by following the sorting of Vph1-GFP-Ub in <italic>cdc48</italic><sup>ÎC-term</sup> cells that lack the Doa1-PFU Cdc48 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>).

In contrast, Vph1-GFP-Ub sorting was still defective in <italic>doa1</italic>Î cells as previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, whereas Doa1 provides an important function with regard to sorting proteins along the MVB pathway, its association with Cdc48 is not critical.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>PLAA (Doa1) was discovered, along with Ufd1, -2, and -4, as an important component of the yeast Ub fusion-dependent degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). It was eventually found that these proteins interact with the hexameric p97 ATPase, which uses these and other adaptor proteins to dictate the fate of a variety of substrates, either facilitating proper folding or Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation. Doa1/Ufd3 is critical for proper function of a number of Ub-dependent processes; however, the precise biochemical activity Doa1/PLAA provides <italic>in vivo</italic> is not clear. One possibility is that it modulates or counteracts the ubiquitinating E3 ligase activity of Ufd2 associated with p97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Genetic and biochemical data support this idea because deletion of <italic>UFD2</italic> alleviates some of the growth defects caused by <italic>DOA1</italic> loss. Furthermore, Ufd2 competes for the same site on p97 (the LYG-containing C terminus). Recently, it has been reported that the core region of Ufd2 consists of multiple Armadillo-like repeats, raising the possibility that this region interacts with the p97 C terminus in a manner similar to the PUL domain of Doa1/PLAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The multivalent nature of assembled p97 would theoretically be able to support simultaneous binding of Ufd2, PLAA, and other C-terminally associated factors such as PNGase, Rnf1, and Ubxd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Yet <italic>in vivo</italic>, Cdc48 complexes with Ufd2 have no simultaneous Doa1 bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Other mechanisms such as weak homo-oligomeric associations of Ufd2 or the PLAA PUL domain that would favor occupancy of the p97 C terminus with only Ufd2 or PLAA may account for the final assembly of different p97 complexes. Evidence for such higher order oligomeric interfaces between PUL domains, however, is lacking, and further work will be required to determine how the p97 C terminus is exclusively bound to Ufd2 or PLAA or other factors.</p><p>Competition between Ufd2 and PLAA could be important for regulating p97-mediated ubiquitination signaling pathways. If Ufd2 is a vigorous E3 ligase, its unrestrained activity could lead to lowered global levels of free Ub. Although the simple model of competition for binding could potentially explain the antagonistic genetic interaction of Doa1 and Ufd2, this simple model is not supported by data showing that expression of Doa1 truncations containing the Cdc48-binding PUL domain are not functional. These data support the idea that displacement of Ufd2 is not the only important Doa1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, the regulation of binding of PLAA, PNGase, and Ufd2 can be mediated by phosphorylation of the conserved Tyr<sup>805</sup> residue of p97. Despite no structural homology between PLAA and PNGase Tyr<sup>805</sup> of p97 plays an indispensable role in these interactions, forming ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interaction. Phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>805</sup> disrupts interaction with both PNGase and PLAA, and it will be interesting to determine whether Ufd2 association is similarly perturbed. Regulation of Tyr<sup>805</sup> may provide a phosphorylation-driven switch that could prevent all C-terminal interactions or could swap one set of p97 interactors for another.</p><p>PLAA was proposed to regulate activation of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Using antibodies to the amphipathic Î±-helical melittin, a mouse cDNA variant that encoded a unique, melittin-like protein sequence downstream of the WD40 domain in lieu of the PFU or PUL domains was originally identified (GenBank<sup>TM</sup> accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M57958">M57958</ext-link>). An alternative amphipathic helix within the PUL domain of PLAA has been proposed to work as a melittin-like phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). This region corresponds to the second Î±-helix in the PUL domain defined as residues Gly<sup>560</sup>âGln<sup>595</sup>. As an isolated peptide, this region would likely also form an amphipathic Î±-helix that would activate phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. However, in the context of the PUL domain, most of the hydrophobic side chains face inward toward the core. The tightly folded nature of the PUL domain makes it unlikely that such a region would be able to act independently as an amphipathic Î±-helix within the context of full-length PLAA. Thus, there is little biochemical rationale for PLAA serving as a true activator of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity.</p><p>Stacks of ARM repeats are usually rigid and form banana-shaped domains that generate good binding surfaces, particularly on the inside curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Three-dimensional structure comparisons of the PUL domain using the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) identified 17 proteins with Z-scores greater than 10, the top three of which were importin-Î±, Î²-catenin, and Hsp70-binding protein, which all have classical Armadillo repeats. Despite structural homology, these proteins have distinct molecular functions and biological roles. Interestingly, a number of ligands are known for importin-Î± and Î²-catenin. Importin-Î± has the capacity to bind many different proteins with a loosely conserved NLS motif. Î²-Catenin is the central effector of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, interacting via its Armadillo repeat region with numerous partners at the membrane, in the cytosol, and in the nucleus. There is no evidence suggesting that p97 is the only ligand of the PUL domain of PLAA, leaving the possibility that like other ARM repeat proteins additional binding partners may exist. Surprisingly, only two p97 residues appear to contribute to the bulk of the interactions with the PUL domain and are the basis of the observed affinity (5 Î¼<sc>m</sc>). Our structure of the PUL-p97 complex supports the notion of additional PLAA ligands because there are conserved surface residues that lie outside the p97 peptide binding pocket. Indeed, while our manuscript was being prepared, a recently described crystal structure of a portion of the yeast Doa1 PUL domain alone was published along with the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of several point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Although these point mutations did not lie within the binding pocket we define for the DLYG Cdc48 ligand, they mapped to conserved residues that lie in an adjacent groove and indeed caused a loss of Doa1 function <italic>in vivo</italic>, which could be due to the loss of binding factors in addition to Cdc48.</p><p>Mutations confined to the Cdc48 DLYG binding pocket defined in our crystal structure led to selective changes in the overall function of Doa1. The <italic>doa1</italic><sup>ÎCdc48</sup> cells displayed some of the phenotypes observed for <italic>doa1</italic>Î cells, such as susceptibility to high temperature and EDTA. However, other Doa1 functions did not require Cdc48 interaction via the PUL domain such as resistance to caffeine and cadmium. The <italic>doa1</italic><sup>ÎCdc48</sup> cells also had partial resistance to ADCB, a toxic compound that is transported via the cell surface Gap1 permease and a crude measure of its Ub-dependent sorting. The converse mutation, Cdc48 lacking the last five residues that mediate binding to Doa1, also resulted in a diverse set of phenotypes that were different from <italic>doa1</italic>Î and <italic>doa1Î ufd2</italic>Î cells. Together, our results indicate that Doa1 partially functions in a complex with Cdc48 but that Doa1 also has a functional life outside of this context. At least one of these functions includes its role in facilitating MVB sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins because Cdc48 mutants that are devoid of Doa1 binding are normal in this regard. Given the dramatic effect on Doa1 function when the entire PUL domain is deleted and the genetically separable effects of the <italic>cdc48</italic><sup>ÎC-term</sup> mutation from <italic>doa1</italic>Î and <italic>ufd2</italic>Î mutations, we suspect that both the Doa1 PUL domain and the Cdc48 C terminus have potential interacting partners that have yet been identified.</p></sec>
