      <abstract>
        <p>Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is an X-linked developmental disorder characterized by congenital cataract, dental anomalies, facial dysmorphism and, in some cases, mental retardation. Protein truncation mutations in a novel gene (<italic>NHS</italic>) have been identified in patients with this syndrome. We previously mapped X-linked congenital cataract (CXN) in one family to an interval on chromosome Xp22.13 which encompasses the <italic>NHS</italic> locus; however, no mutations were identified in the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. In this study, we show that NHS and X-linked cataract are allelic diseases. Two CXN families, which were negative for mutations in the <italic>NHS</italic> gene, were further analysed using array comparative genomic hybridization. CXN was found to be caused by novel copy number variations: a complex duplicationâtriplication re-arrangement and an intragenic deletion, predicted to result in altered transcriptional regulation of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. Furthermore, we also describe the clinical and molecular analysis of seven families diagnosed with NHS, identifying four novel protein truncation mutations and a novel large deletion encompassing the majority of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene, all leading to no functional protein. We therefore show that different mechanisms, aberrant transcription of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene or no functional NHS protein, lead to different diseases. Our data highlight the importance of copy number variation and non-recurrent re-arrangements leading to different severity of disease and describe the potential mechanisms involved.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is an X-linked cataractâdental syndrome (OMIM 302350) characterized by bilateral congenital cataract (usually requiring early surgery in affected males) associated with microcornea and microphthalmia, multiple dental anomalies and characteristic facial features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C2">2</xref>). Dental abnormalities include Hutchinsonian incisors (screwdriver-shaped incisors), supernumerary maxillary incisors and widely spaced teeth (diastema) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C3">3</xref>). Associated facial features include prominent nose and nasal bridge, long face and large ears with anteverted pinnae. A proportion of affected males (â¼30% of cases) have developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C7">7</xref>). Carrier females typically display posterior Y-sutural lens opacities often with cortical riders that are likely to be congenital, whereas the dental and facial anomalies of the syndrome may be observed, but with a milder presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C8">8</xref>). The minimal locus for this syndrome was mapped on Xp22, and subsequently mutations were identified within the coding exons of a novel gene, <italic>NHS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C12">12</xref>). The <italic>NHS</italic> gene is alternatively spliced and composed of at least 10 coding exons with at least 3 isoforms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Isoform A (<italic>NHS-A</italic>) has eight exons encoding a 1630-amino acid protein with an unusually large intron 1 (â¼350 kb); isoform B (<italic>NHS-B</italic>) is transcribed from exon 1b and translated from exon 4 encoding a 1335-amino acid protein; and isoform C (<italic>NHS-C</italic>) is transcribed and translated from exon 1a coding for a 1453-amino acid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C13">13</xref>). To date, 18 pathogenic mutations have been identified in 4 of the 10 coding exons of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene, all of which are predicted to result in a truncated NHS protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C18">18</xref>). Isoform A is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of NHS, because patient mutations identified in exon 1 are only predicted to affect this isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C12">12</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). The function of the NHS protein is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C13">13</xref>).</p>
      <p>Non-syndromic X-linked congenital cataract is characterized by bilateral total nuclear cataract in affected males and Y-sutural opacities in carrier females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C22">22</xref>). Early studies reported linkage with the Xg blood group on Xp22 (20). We previously described a four-generation family with X-linked congenital cataract (CXN) and mapped the disease locus to an â¼3.5 Mb interval on Xp22.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C24">24</xref>). This family did not exhibit the dental phenotype and facial dysmorphology of NHS; however, four of the six affected males also had congenital cardiac anomalies. The disease locus for this family mapped to the same critical region as NHS, suggesting allelic heterogeneity; however, mutation screening of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene failed to identify the cause of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C24">24</xref>). The NHS critical interval is also syntenic with the mouse congenital cataract disease locus <italic>Xcat</italic> (X-linked cataract) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C26">26</xref>). The <italic>Xcat</italic> mutation is characterized by congenital total lens opacities present at eye opening in both hemizygous males and homozygous females, whereas in heterozygous carrier females, the phenotype varies from barely noticeable to totally opaque lenses, similar to the cataract phenotype of NHS patients. The <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse was found to have a 487 kb insertion in intron 1 of the mouse <italic>Nhs1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C27">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this report, we describe a clinical and molecular analysis of seven families diagnosed with NHS and two families with X-linked cataract. All mutations causing an NHS phenotype are null mutations predicted to produce no functional protein. Our comparative genomic hybridization and subsequent molecular analyses revealed novel copy number variations of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene leading to cataract, demonstrating for the first time that NHS and X-linked cataract are allelic diseases.</p>

          <p>Proband II:3 was diagnosed with bilateral congenital cataract and microphthalmia, typical dysmorphic features and moderately delayed mental development (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP206TB1">1</xref>). He had NHS dental anomalies including broad diastema mediale, hyperplastic labial frenulum, screwdriver-shaped incisors (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F2">2</xref>B) and hypoplastic enamel (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F2">2</xref>C). Sequencing of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene in affected male (II:3) revealed a novel frameshift mutation in exon 2. A deletion of 1 bp (c.614delC) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F3">3</xref>) at the second position of codon 205 alters the reading frame and is predicted to result in a premature stop codon following the addition of 77 amino acid, p.Pro206fsX282. Segregation analysis was performed to test for carrier status in the proband's asymptomatic mother (I:1) and his sisters (II:1 and II:2, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F1">1</xref>B).

His older affected brother (II:2) displayed similar ocular phenotype (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP206TB1">1</xref>). Their mother (I:1) had typical carrier posterior Y-sutural opacities (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F2">2</xref>E) and undiagnosed impacted teeth. Screening of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 3. A C&gt;T transition (c.C742T) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F3">3</xref>) at the first position of codon 248 alters the amino acid sequence from an arginine to a stop codon, p.Arg248X. The introduction of a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene is predicted to result in a severely truncated protein product.

He also had mild bilateral hearing loss, and computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated inner-ear dysplasia. His mother (I:1) had a history of cataracts diagnosed in her 20s and dental extraction of multiple supernumerary teeth. Interestingly, we detected a C&gt;T nonsense mutation (c.C742T, p.Arg248X) in proband II:1 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F3">3</xref>) and his carrier mother I:1, which was identical to the nonsense mutation we identified in Family C and to a previously described mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C18">18</xref>).</p>

          <p>Individual II:1 was diagnosed with dental anomalies, dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay, but with an unusually mild cataract for NHS (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F2">2</xref>G and TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP206TB1">1</xref>). His mother (I:1) had typical carrier features of NHS with asymptomatic cataract of very fine dots in a posterior Y-shaped distribution. Her teeth were also anomalous with poor enamel.</p>
          <p>All coding exons of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene were successfully amplified and sequenced, except for exon 8. To understand why it was not possible to amplify exon 8, a chromosome walking strategy was adopted. Three exon 8 specific primers were designed: <italic>NHS</italic>Ex8ext, <italic>NHS</italic>Ex8 and <italic>NHS</italic>Ex8a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). Using primer pair <italic>NHS</italic>Ex8a/Uni, a unique fragment of â¼700 bp was amplified. The PCR product was gel-purified and sequenced to reveal an insertion at the first position of codon 1521 (c.4561) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F3">3</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence from patient II:1 revealed a genomic re-arrangement which affects the majority of <italic>NHS</italic> exon 8 coding sequence and the 3â²-UTR. The <italic>NHS</italic> gene is truncated within exon 8 at position c.4561, and the deleted region extends another 4.3 kb to include sequence upstream of the neighbouring <italic>SCML1</italic> gene. The breakpoint junction also contains an insertion of a 17 bp fragment from the opposite (â) strand (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F4">4</xref>A). Thus, a novel mutation in exon 8 was detected, which is the first NHS chromosomal re-arrangement described and is predicted to result in a premature stop codon with the addition of 11 aberrant amino acid, p.Ser1521fsX1531 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F3">3</xref>). A diagnostic PCR reaction was designed, using primer pair NHSEx8CR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>), which successfully confirmed the presence of the chromosome re-arrangement in patient II:1 and its absence from 200 controls. Sequence analysis of the junction fragment revealed features similar to a previously described genomic re-arrangement in LIS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C28">28</xref>), suggesting that this complex re-arrangement may be caused by a recently described mechanism of replication named fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C29">29</xref>).</p>

        <p>The phenotype for Family H has been previously reported as X-linked cataract (CXN) without the features of NHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C19">19</xref>). In brief, all affected males required cataract extraction in the first few months of life. Carrier females had mild fan-shaped central nuclear opacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C19">19</xref>). Features typical of NHS such as dental anomalies, dysmorphism and developmental delay were not described in this family; however, congenital heart defects with a variety of diagnoses (ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, ventriculoseptal defect and stenosis of a major cardiac vessel) were reported in four out of six affected males at the time of clinical examination. Genetic linkage studies in this family had previously shown that CXN was linked to the <italic>NHS</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C20">20</xref>). All coding exons of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene were successfully amplified and sequenced and no mutations were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C12">12</xref>). Here, we describe the analysis of DNA from an affected male (IV:4) for copy number variation using a dense X-chromosome array.</p>
        <p>Comparative genomic hybridization array data analysis revealed the presence of a complex re-arrangement consisting of triplication of a region encompassing <italic>NHS</italic>, <italic>SCML1</italic> and <italic>RAI2</italic> genes embedded within a duplicated region (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>A). The mean log<sub>2</sub> ratio indicates that an â¼0.5 Mb region between ChX:17334242 and ChX:17800551 is triplicated, flanked by a duplication that extends 0.2 Mb distal and 0.1 Mb proximal to the identified triplication (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>A). To validate the presence of a triplicated region, a SYBR-green quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiment was performed on four family samples: DNA from affected males IV:1 and IV:4 and DNA from unaffected males III:2 and V:3. Using primer pair NHSEx8c (Table S1) located within the triplicated region, the number of amplified copies of DNA for the affected males reaches the fluorescence threshold with a smaller <italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> value compared with the number of amplified copies of DNA for the unaffected males. The results obtained from Data Analysis for Real-Time PCR (DART-PCR) are shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>B, and the <italic>R</italic><sub>o</sub> values averaged for controls and patients show a significant increase of 2.8-fold in the two affected males compared with the two unaffected males.</p>

        <p>The triplicated region includes the <italic>NHS</italic> gene lacking exon 1, and the entire <italic>SCML1</italic> and <italic>RAI2</italic> genes. To define the breakpoint regions of this complex re-arrangement, a chromosome walking strategy was used. Three target-specific primers (TSPs) were designed in the breakpoint 3 region (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>A): Bk3F1, Bk3F2 and Bk3F3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). Using primer pair Bk3F3/Uni, amplification of two products was detected. Direct sequencing of these products revealed that breakpoint 3 (at ChrX:17800261) joins sequence downstream of <italic>RAI2</italic> to sequence of unknown origin (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>C). The same strategy was used to define the proximal breakpoint (breakpoint 4, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>A). Additional TSPs, Bk4F1, Bk4F2 and Bk4F3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>), were designed in the proximal breakpoint region (breakpoint 4). Amplification of an â¼1.4 kb product was detected using primer pair Bk4F3/Uni. Direct sequencing of this product revealed that breakpoint 4 (at ChrX:17926944) joins sequence downstream of the <italic>RAI2</italic> gene to sequence upstream of exon 1 of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene (ChrX:17105038) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>C). Attempts to walk across distal breakpoint 2 located between ChrX:17104696 and ChrX:17105121 were not successful, and walking across distal breakpoint 1 located between ChrX:17334022 and ChrX:17334242 was not performed.</p>
        <p>Sequence analysis of breakpoint 4 also revealed the presence of âmirroredâ sequences at both the distal and proximal re-arrangement boundaries (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F4">4</xref>B). This breakpoint occurs in sequence which is conserved across species (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F4">4</xref>D) and is possibly a promoter region for the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. Disruption of this conserved upstream region is predicted to affect the transcription of one copy of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. Therefore, we conclude that one copy of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene lacks exon 1 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>A), another copy has all known exons but is disrupted upstream, and a third copy is intact. The three copies of the <italic>SCML1</italic> and <italic>RAI2</italic> genes appear complete. The additional phenotype of congenital heart defects observed in some affected males could be due to perturbed <italic>NHS</italic> gene transcription or increased dosage of the <italic>NHS, SCML1</italic> or <italic>RAI2</italic> genes. Segregation of the complex copy number variation in Family H was confirmed using primer pair CXNâBk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>) designed to amplify across breakpoint 4 of the segmental duplicationâtriplication (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>D). A PCR product of 338 bp representing successful amplification across the breakpoint was detected in all 10 affected and carrier individuals and not in unaffected members of Family H.</p>

        <title><italic>NHS</italic> intragenic deletion and resulting phenotype</title>
        <p>Individual III:1 from Family I was diagnosed with dense bilateral nuclear cataracts at 6 weeks. At 2 months, there appeared to be no dysmorphic features characteristic of NHS. However, he did have a small pit in the right external ear in the ascending limb of the helix, which may be a small pre-auricular sinus. His older brother, individual III:2, shows no NHS features or pre-auricular sinus and had milder posterior sutural lens opacities, which were not operated on. Their mother (II:1) showed typical carrier Y-sutural lens opacities. Her father had cataract surgery at 45 years of age. There were no further details available of this individual. This family was therefore diagnosed as X-linked cataract. Laryngomalacia was also noted, which presented as inspiratory stridor in both boys. All of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene-coding exons and their splice sites were successfully amplified and sequenced. No mutation was identified in this family.</p>
        <p>We then analysed DNA from individual III:1 for copy number variation using a dense X-chromosome array as described. Comparative genomic hybridization array data revealed the presence of an intragenic segmental deletion (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>E). The mean log<sub>2</sub> ratio indicates that an â¼5.1 kb region, between ChrX:17461256 and ChrX:17466720 located within the <italic>NHS</italic> gene, is deleted. Using primers pair <italic>NHS</italic>intron1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>), PCR amplification of this region in the affected male (III:1) produced a smaller DNA fragment of 913 bp compared with a product of 5724 bp in an unaffected control sample (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>F). Sequence analysis revealed a 4.8 kb deletion within the large (â¼350 kb) intron 1 of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>G). Analysis of the junctional sequence showed microhomology between the distal and proximal breakpoints, with 2 bp (CT) of perfect identity (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F4">4</xref>C). The mechanism for this deletion could be either non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or a single FoSTes event. The intragenic region between ChrX:17465805 and ChrX:17466048 contains several highly conserved regions. The largest conserved region within the deletion is shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F4">4</xref>E and may be a regulatory sequence for the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. This deletion is therefore predicted to cause altered transcriptional regulation of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene.</p>

      <p>We identified copy number variations of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene in two families with X-linked cataract, using array comparative genomic analysis (CGH). A segmental duplicationâtriplication encompassing the <italic>NHS</italic>, <italic>SCML1</italic> and <italic>RAI2</italic> genes (0.8 Mb) was identified in Family H, and a 4.8 kb deletion in <italic>NHS</italic> intron 1 was identified in Family I. This is the first report describing X-linked cataract phenotypes caused by copy number variation mutation. There is a striking difference in predicted mutational consequence leading to cataract or syndrome. NHS is caused by null mutations leading to non-functional NHS protein. X-linked cataract in the families described is likely to be caused by aberrant transcription of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. This hypothesis is supported by our molecular analyses of two cataract families described in this study and also by the identification of the mutation causing X-linked cataract (<italic>Xcat</italic>) in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C27">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>In CXN Family H, the segmental duplicationâtriplication breakpoint 4 occurs in a region located upstream of one copy of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. This region is conserved across species (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F4">4</xref>D). It is therefore likely that this region harbours important promoter sequence elements required for the spatial and temporal expression of <italic>NHS</italic> during development, and that disruption of the promoter leads to aberrant transcription of one copy of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene in the affected members of this family. Another copy of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene lacks exon 1; therefore, isoform A will not be expressed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F5">5</xref>A). The third copy of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene in affected members of this family may have preserved developmental expression control elements, however increased dosage of the transcript could also be a mechanism leading to CXN in affected members of the family.</p>
      <p>In CXN Family I, a 4.8 kb deletion was detected within the unusually large intron 1 (â¼350 kb) of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. Interestingly, this deleted region also contains conserved sequences, which may represent potential promoter sequences, such that the deletion could lead to aberrant transcription of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene. This is supported by the fact that in the compact genome of Fugu, where gene density is high and introns are small (majority &lt;150 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C30">30</xref>), the large <italic>NHS</italic> intron 1 is proportionally retained (â¼30 kb), suggesting the presence of functional elements. The hypothesis that intron 1 is important for transcriptional regulation is supported by the identification of the mutation in the <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C27">27</xref>). The large size of <italic>NHS</italic> intron 1 is conserved in mouse (283 kb) and the <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse has a 487 kb insertional mutation in <italic>Nhs</italic> intron 1, resulting in a 770 kb separation of exons 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C27">27</xref>). This led to the absence of expression of the major isoform of the <italic>Nhs</italic> gene which contains exon 1 (isoform A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C27">27</xref>). Collectively, the <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse mutation and phenotype, and our data indicating aberrant transcription of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene causes CXN, suggest that the <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse is an excellent model for CXN, but may not be a model for NHS. A knock-in mouse mutant of an NHS patient protein truncation mutation, or knock-out model, may lead to a dental phenotype, developmental delay and perhaps other symptoms associated with NHS.</p>
      <p>Congenital heart defects were observed in four of six affected males in Family H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C23">23</xref>). The additional phenotype in this family could be due to aberrant transcription of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene or increased dosage (triplicated) of the <italic>NHS</italic>, <italic>SCML1</italic> or <italic>RAI2</italic> genes. Retinoic acid-induced 2 protein (encoded by <italic>RAI2</italic>) is a good candidate, as retinoic acid is important for heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C31">31</xref>). Developmental expression studies in mouse suggest that <italic>Nhs</italic> may also play a role in heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C11">11</xref>). The mutation identified in NHS Family G supports the hypothesis that aberrant transcription of the NHS gene is responsible for congenital heart defects in CXN Family H. In Family G, we detected a segmental deletion which encompasses the majority of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene and the entire <italic>SCML1</italic>, <italic>RAI2</italic> and <italic>CXorf20</italic> genes. Despite the absence of these additional genes (<italic>SCML1</italic>, <italic>RAI2</italic> and <italic>CXorf20</italic>), Family G did not exhibit any cardiac abnormalities. It would appear therefore that aberrant transcription or a dosage effect of <italic>NHS</italic> leads to cardiac anomalies in Family H. Further support comes from a recent report describing a 2.8 Mb microdeletion of 16 genes on Xp22, including <italic>NHS</italic> and <italic>RAI2</italic>, with a phenotype of early seizures, severe encephalopathy, NHS and the congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C32">32</xref>). However, further work is required before one can assign heart defects in patients with specific genes affected by copy number variations on Xp22.</p>
      <p>The intragenic re-arrangement detected in <italic>NHS</italic> exon 8 in Family F, segmental duplicationâtriplication in Family H and segmental deletion in Family I are non-recurrent genomic re-arrangements. We performed molecular analysis of breakpoints to determine the nature and mechanism of these genomic re-arrangements. In Family F, the chromosomal re-arrangement is likely to have occurred by the newly described mechanism of replication FoSTeS, as microhomology was detected at the junction breakpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C29">29</xref>). In Family I, the segmental deletion occurred either by NHEJ or by a single FoSTeS event, as microhomology was also noted at the breakpoint junction; however, a precise mechanism could not be assigned. The duplicationâtriplication breakpoints 3 and 4 confirm two independent events leading to the complex re-arrangement observed with CGH in Family H. Breakpoint 4 appears to be caused by a new mechanism, as âmirroredâ sequences were identified at the junctional fragments. To our knowledge, the breakpoint sequence of only one other segmental duplicationâtriplication has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C28">28</xref>). In this article, the chromosomal re-arrangement encompasses a region on 17p13 in one patient with a developmental brain abnormality, but no mirrored sequences at the breakpoints were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C28">28</xref>). We suggest, therefore, that novel mechanisms may be responsible for the re-arrangements identified in Families H and I which warrant further characterization.</p>
      <p>Four novel protein truncation mutations, p.Q158X (exon 1), p.P206fs (exon 2), p.K850fs (exon 6), p.S1521fs (exon8), and a large deletion encompassing the majority of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene were identified in five of the seven NHS families. The two remaining NHS families, one from the UK (Family C) and one from Canada (Family D), were found to have the same protein truncation mutation p.R248X (exon 3). This mutation has also been identified in an Australian NHS family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C18">18</xref>). Since the majority of NHS families described have a unique mutation, it is likely that these families are related. Referring clinicians confirmed that Families C and D are likely to be related, however their relationship with the Australian family previously described has not been confirmed. We have also identified a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in exon 2 (p.P206fs) in one NHS patient and the first intragenic chromosomal re-arrangement causing NHS, which results in a frameshift mutation in exon 8 (S1521fs), predicted to result in a truncated, aberrant protein product. In addition, we identified a large deletion encompassing the majority of the <italic>NHS</italic> gene in Family G predicted to result in no NHS protein. This brings the total number of mutations identified in the <italic>NHS</italic> gene causing NHS to 23, all of which are null mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C18">18</xref>). A summary of the clinical findings for each family is given in TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP206TB1">1</xref>. All patients with null mutations have the classic cataract and dental anomalies, which characterize NHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C2">2</xref>). Clinical variability also exists in our patient group. Given that Families C and D have the same mutation, one might expect clinical correlation; however, individual II:1 in Family D had bilateral mild hearing loss, with CT scans showing inner-ear dysplasia. This is the first report of an auditory phenotype associated with NHS. We found that UniGene cluster Hs.201623 has several NHS cDNA clones derived from fetal cochlea, suggesting that the gene may be important for the development of this organ. However, the fact that neither of the two affected boys in Family C suffers from hearing loss suggests that other genetic or environmental factors influence the phenotype. In our NHS patient cohort, developmental delay and behavioural problems were commonly observed (four out of seven NHS families, 57%), which we propose is also due to modifier effects influencing phenotype. Interestingly, no missense mutations in the <italic>NHS</italic> gene have been reported to date, which suggests that missense mutations do not cause disease, or that they lead to a more severe phenotype. Other loci and genes causing syndromic or isolated X-linked cataract have been described, for example Lowe syndrome on Xq26.1 and a locus on Xq24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C34">34</xref>). Further investigation of phenotypic variation and CNVs at these loci will enhance our understanding of phenotypeâgenotype correlation.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated that NHS and CXN are allelic disorders caused by different effects on <italic>NHS</italic> gene function and expression. Our data show the importance of copy number variation and non-recurrent re-arrangements leading to different severities of disease and describe the potential mechanisms involved. We have also shown that genetic or environmental modifiers of <italic>NHS</italic> gene function influence phenotype. Our study, taken together with the <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse study, indicates that the unusually large intron 1 of the <italic>NHS</italic> is important for gene regulation, and that the <italic>Xcat</italic> mouse is a model for X-linked cataract.</p>

        <title>Patients and clinical assessment</title>
        <p>Patients diagnosed with NHS, or CXN, were ascertained in clinics in the UK, Canada and Norway. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals or their guardians and a blood sample taken for genomic DNA isolation. Where available, DNA from additional family members was collected. Family members were examined by clinical geneticists and/or ophthalmologists and family histories were taken. Of the nine families described (AâH), seven were diagnosed with NHS and two with CXN. Pedigree structures are shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP206F1">1</xref>. Pedigree H is an abridged pedigree of a previously described family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C24">24</xref>), and part of Family C was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP206C11">11</xref>; Pedigree 6). All were consistent with X-linked inheritance and lacked a molecular diagnosis, however recessive inheritance could not be ruled out for Families B and E.</p>

        <p>All <italic>NHS</italic> coding exons and their splice sites were amplified and sequenced directly from genomic DNA (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2,</ext-link> for primers and conditions). ReddyMixâ¢ PCR Master Mix (Abgene, Epsom, UK) was used for amplification with 2 pmol of each primer and 150 ng DNA. For <italic>NHS</italic> exon 1, Abgene Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR Master Mix was used. PCR conditions were as follows: 95Â°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95Â°C for 30 s, annealing temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</ext-link>) for 30 s, and 72Â°C for 30â90 s, with a final extension at 72Â°C for 5 min. PCR products were purified using ExoSAP- IT<sup>Â®</sup> (USB), following manufacturer's protocols. Purified PCR products were sequenced using ABI BigDye terminator cycle sequencing chemistry version 3.1 on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystem) following manufacturer's protocols. Patient DNA sequences were analysed using Lasergene software (DNASTAR Inc.). To verify the pathogenicity of the mutations identified, 200 control male DNA samples (i.e. 200 X-chromosomes) were tested. Specific primer pairs, incorporating the mutation detected, were designed to test control individuals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp206/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>).</p>
