        <p>The bioactive phospholipids, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA), regulate pivotal processes related to the pathogenesis of cancer. Here, we report characterization of a novel lipid kinase, designated acylglycerol kinase (AGK), that phosphorylates monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol to form LPA and PA, respectively. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation suggest that AGK is localized to the mitochondria. AGK expression was up-regulated in prostate cancers compared with normal prostate tissues from the same patient. Expression of AGK in PC-3 prostate cancer cells markedly increased formation and secretion of LPA. This increase resulted in concomitant transactivation of the EGF receptor and sustained activation of extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) 1/2, culminating in enhanced cell proliferation. AGK expression also increased migratory responses. Conversely, down-regulating expression of endogenous AGK inhibited EGF- but not LPA-induced ERK1/2 activation and progression through the S phase of the cell cycle. Hence, AGK can amplify EGF signaling pathways and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Originally known for its pedestrian role as an intermediate in intracellular lipid metabolism, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is now recognized as a potent lipid mediator that evokes growth factorâlike responses and regulates an array of cellular processes related to pathogenesis of cancer (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>). Progress in understanding LPA actions has accelerated with the discovery that it is a ligand of several G proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs), termed LPA<sub>1</sub>, LPA<sub>2</sub>, and LPA<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, expression of LPA receptors correlates with more advanced prostate cancer cell lines (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to actions through conventional GPCR signaling pathways, LPA receptors can indirectly regulate cell functions by transactivating the EGF tyrosine kinase receptor (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>). This cross-communication between different signaling systems is not only important for the growth-promoting activity of LPA (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>) but it may also be a clue to its pathophysiological role in prostate cancer (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>). The recent discovery that LPA can be generated in the extracellular milieu from lysophosphatidylcholine by the ectoenzyme autotaxin, known to be involved in tumor invasion, neovascularization, and metastasis (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Umezu-Goto et al., 2002</xref>), further supports the notion that LPA is an important regulator of tumor progression (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>A potential pathway for synthesis of LPA is the phosphorylation of monoacylglycerol by a specific lipid kinase (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Pieringer and Hokin, 1962</xref>), an enzyme that has remained an enigma for more than 40 yr. We have now cloned and characterized a novel acylglycerol kinase (AGK) that phosphorylates both monoacylglycerol to form LPA and diacylglycerol to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), another potent lipid second messenger that mediates mitogenic activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2001</xref>). LPA produced by AGK in turn activates the EGF receptor, amplifying mitogenic and survival signals and regulating EGF-directed motility. Our results suggest that AGK, which is highly expressed in prostate cancers, might be important for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, processes in which LPA plays prominent roles (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kue and Daaka, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kue et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>).</p>

        <title>A new lipid kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of acylglycerols to generate LPA and PA</title>
        <p>While searching for additional isoforms of sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), another serum-borne lysophospholipid structurally similar to LPA, we cloned a related gene that encodes a 422âamino acid protein (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1</ext-link>). Although this new kinase was cloned based on its homology to SphKs, it only displayed barely detectable phosphorylating activity with sphingosine as substrate when compared with cells transfected with SphK1 or SphK2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Moreover, there were no detectable changes in the levels of the sphingolipid metabolites, ceramide, sphingosine, or S1P, in cells overexpressing this lipid kinase. Furthermore, when AGK transfectants were labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine, there were no significant increases detected in the formation of [<sup>3</sup>H]S1P compared with vector-transfected cells (unpublished data).</p>

<bold>Lipid kinase activity of recombinant AGK.</bold> (A) NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with vector, hSphK1, hSphK2, or hAGK.

(B) Lipid-phosphorylating activity was determined in cell lysates from NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with vector (open bars) or hAGK (closed bars). The following lipids were tested: Sph, C<sub>6</sub>-cer; 1-oleoyl-2-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (18:1), MOG; 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (20:4), 2-AG; 1-palmitoyl-2-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (16:0), MPG; 1-stearoyl-2-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (18:0), MSG; or diacylglycerol (1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol), DAG. Where indicated, octyl-Î²-glucopyranoside detergent was added to a final concentration of 1.5%. The data are expressed as picomoles of phosphorylated product formed per minute per milligram Â± SD.

        <p>We examined in vitro kinase activity with an array of lipid substrates, including different ceramide species and glycerolipids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (DAG), glycerol-3-phosphate, anandamide, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and the monoacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (MOG). Significant phosphorylated products were only detected with monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols as substrates, but not with any other lipid tested, including ceramide and sphingosine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B); thus, we have designated this lipid kinase as an AGK. Although AGK contains a DAG kinase (DAGK) catalytic domain (Fig. S1), it did not significantly phosphorylate DAG when activity was measured in the presence of the detergent octyl-Î²-glucopyranoside (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), as usually used for DAGK activity measurements (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bunting et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that AGK is distinct from other known DAGKs.</p>
        <p>Previously, a partially purified bovine brain monoacylglycerol kinase (MAGK) was reported to prefer substrates containing unsaturated fatty acid esters (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Shim et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 1991</xref>). Interestingly, AGK has higher activity with substrates containing a C18 fatty acid with one double bond, as monoacylglycerol with an oleoyl (18:1) substitution in the <italic>sn1</italic> position was phosphorylated to a greater extent than 1-palmitoyl-2-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (16:0), which was a better substrate than 1-stearoyl-2-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol (18:0) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Moreover, 1-<italic>sn</italic>-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, an endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sugiura et al., 2000</xref>), was also a reasonably good substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Like the crude bovine brain MAGK activity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Shim et al., 1989</xref>), AGK required magnesium for maximal activity, whereas other divalent cations, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, inhibited phosphorylation of MOG. Similar to brain MAGK, AGK also had higher activity in the presence of 0.03% deoxycholate, although enzymatic activity was completely abolished by most other detergents, including Triton X-100, Triton X-114, CHAPS, and Î²-octylglucopyranoside (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B and not depicted).</p>
        <p>While this manuscript was in revision, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Waggoner et al. (2004)</xref> showed that AGK expressed in bacteria phosphorylates DAG as well as MOG and ceramide, but not sphingosine, whereas in lysates of AGK-overexpressing cells, ceramide was not phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), nor did we detect any phosphorylation of ceramide or sphingosine in vivo.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of AGK</title>
        <p>Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that AGK was distributed in a punctate, reticular pattern in NIH 3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A), which is reminiscent of a mitochondrial localization. There was no significant colocalization with the ER marker calnexin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). On the other hand, AGK expression clearly colocalized with mitochondria stained with MitoTracker red (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Similar mitochondrial localization of AGK was also observed in HEK 293 and PC-3 cells (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that the subcellular distribution was not cell type specific. In agreement, although AGK does not contain a canonical mitochondrial localization signal, the MitoProt II website predicts an 80% probability of mitochondrial localization, and the program TMpred predicted one transmembrane region from amino acid 11 to 30.</p>

(D) 400-Î¼g aliquots of lysates from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with vector (open bars) or V5-AGK (closed bars) were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody as described in Materials and methods, and AGK activity was determined in the immunoprecipitates. Data are expressed as picomoles of LPA formed in 30 min and are means Â± SD of duplicate determinations.</p>

        <p>To further substantiate the localization of AGK, protein expression and enzymatic activity were examined in subcellular fractions prepared by differential centrifugation. V5-Epitopeâtagged AGK with the predicted MW of 46.4 kD was highly enriched in the P2 mitochondria fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Much less AGK was present in the P3 fraction containing intracellular membranes of the ER and Golgi or in the P4 plasma membrane fraction. In concordance with the protein expression pattern, the highest AGK-specific activity was in P2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C).</p>

        <title>AGK regulates LPA and PA in vivo</title>
        <p>To definitively demonstrate that AGK has intrinsic kinase activity rather than affecting the activity of some endogenous lipid kinase, phosphorylation of acylglycerol substrates after specific pull-down of epitope-tagged AGK expressed in HEK 293 cells with V5 antibody was determined. Although the V5 antibody inhibits AGK, phosphorylation of MOG was sixfold greater in immunoprecipitates from V5-AGK transfectants than vector transfectants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D) and there was no significant phosphorylating activity with other lipid substrates (not depicted).</p>
        <p>To identify the phosphorylated lipids produced by AGK in vivo, vector and AGK PC-3 transfectants were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled orthophosphate and labeled phospholipids in isolated mitochondria examined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Expression of AGK resulted in 80% increase of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled PA without significantly affecting labeling of the other mitochondrial phospholipids. Because it is known that LPA synthesized in mitochondria can readily exit this organelle (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 1999</xref>) or be rapidly metabolized to PA, changes in total cellular phospholipids were also examined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, BâD). There were no obvious differences in labeling of the major known cellular phospholipids in AGK-expressing cells compared with the vector cells. However, two-dimensional HPTLC analysis revealed that a labeled phospholipid that comigrated with authentic LPA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>), although barely detectable in vector cells, was increased threefold in AGK-expressing cells. Moreover, this phospholipid was eliminated by treatment with phospholipase B, which hydrolyzes the ester bonds of lysophospholipids, confirming its identity as LPA. Labeled PA was also increased in these transfectants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D), albeit much less than LPA. Of note, in these cells, AGK mRNA levels relative to 18S RNA were increased by almost twofold over endogenous expression from 1.2 Â± 0.1 to 2.3 Â± 0.2, as determined by quantitative PCR.</p>

        <p>It has previously been shown that cancer cells secrete LPA (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>). Small amounts of labeled lysophospholipids, including LPA, were secreted by vector transfected PC-3 cells. However, secretion of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled LPA was significantly increased threefold by overexpression of AGK (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>), indicating that AGK increases both intracellular and extracellular levels of LPA. It should be noted that AGK was not detectable in the medium by immunoblotting nor did its expression cause apoptosis of cells, suggesting that appearance of LPA in the media is not a result of cell death.</p>

        <title>AGK is highly expressed in prostate cancer</title>
        <p>As LPA has been most prominently associated with growth-promoting effects and probably contributes to cancer (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>), it was of interest to examine the expression of AGK in normal tissues and cancers. By Northern analysis, a 2.6-kb AGK mRNA was widely expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A), most abundantly in heart, kidney, muscle, and brain. Importantly, using a matched human tumor/normal tissue expression array, we found that AGK expression was significantly up-regulated in prostate cancers compared with the normal prostate tissues from the same patient (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). However, not all tumor tissues show an increase in AGK expression. In uterine, cervical, and stomach cancers, there also appeared to be higher expression of AGK compared with the normal tissues, whereas AGK expression seems to be reduced in colon cancer. AGK was also expressed in many types of human cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B), including prostate cancer cells, such as androgen-responsive LNCaP cells, which are more similar to early stage carcinoma, and androgen-insensitive TSU-Pr1 and PC-3 cells, a model for more advanced prostate carcinoma.</p>

        <title>AGK expression enhances cell growth through LPA receptors</title>
        <p>Growth promotion is one of the most prominent effects mediated by LPA (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>). Consistent with its ability to increase LPA synthesis, transient or stable expression of AGK enhanced proliferation of diverse cell types, including PC-3 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, CâE) and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1</ext-link>). The growth-promoting effect of AGK was observed even in the presence of suboptimal serum concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C and Fig. S3 A). Although AGK stimulates growth, it had no cytoprotective effects on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (Fig. S3 D). As expected, exogenous LPA increased proliferation of both AGK and vector transfectants to the same extent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). Addition of MOG to cells cultured in serum-free medium had a minimal effect on vector transfectants and significantly stimulated proliferation of AGK-expressing PC-3 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). This result is probably due to rapid metabolism and degradation of MOG, and thus only in AGK-expressing cells is sufficient LPA produced and secreted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>) to stimulate proliferation.</p>
        <p>FACS analysis revealed that 83 Â± 0.4% of the vector transfectants were in Go/G1 phase and 7.0 Â± 0.04 and 10 Â± 0.4% were in S and G2/M phases, respectively. Overexpression of AGK reduced the fraction of cells in Go/G1 to 73 Â± 0.1% and increased the proportion in the S phase by greater than twofold (15 Â± 0.1%), without significantly affecting the proportion in the G2/M phase (12 Â± 0.1%).</p>
        <p>Although it is well established that the mitogenic effects of LPA in many cell types are mediated by binding to its specific GPCRs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>), intracellular actions have also been suggested (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hooks et al., 2001</xref>), possibly as an agonist of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). To examine the potential involvement of intracellular actions of LPA generated by expression of AGK, its mitogenic effects were examined in rat hepatoma RH7777 cells that do not express LPA<sub>1-4</sub> and do not respond to LPA (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fukushima et al., 1998</xref>). However, in contrast to PC-3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, CâE) and NIH 3T3 (Fig. S3 A) cells, RH7777 cells did not show an increase in DNA synthesis in response to expression of AGK as measured by incorporation of BrdU into nascent DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> F). Although RH7777 cells express AGK, it is possible that they do not produce sufficient amounts of LPA if MOG is limiting. However, even addition of MOG did not enhance BrdU incorporation in RH7777 cells expressing AGK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> F).</p>
        <p>Similar to a previous paper (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lea et al., 2004</xref>), GW9662, a selective antagonist of PPARÎ³, inhibited proliferation of PC-3 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). However, importantly, it did not abrogate the mitogenic effect of AGK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kue et al., 2002</xref>), we found that LPA<sub>1</sub>, LPA<sub>2</sub>, and LPA<sub>3</sub> are expressed in PC-3 cells (unpublished data). It is known that LPA<sub>1</sub> couples to pertussis toxin (PTX)âsensitive Gi, whereas LPA<sub>2</sub> and LPA<sub>3</sub> couple also to Gq. In PC-3 cells, LPA-regulated mitogenic signaling is mediated by GÎ²Î³ subunits derived from PTX-sensitive Gi proteins (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bookout et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement, PTX pretreatment not only inhibited growth of vector transfectants but it also markedly decreased the growth-promoting effects of AGK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). However, AGK expression enhanced cell proliferation even in the presence of PTX.</p>

        <title>AGK promotes transactivation of EGFR</title>
        <p>Many studies have led to the notion that LPA is important in the pathophysiology of prostate carcinoma functioning in an emerging paradigm of cross talk between LPA receptors and the tyrosine kinase EGFR (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</xref>). Therefore, it was of importance to determine whether overexpression of AGK and increased LPA levels resulted in such receptor transactivation leading to enhanced growth.</p>
        <p>In serum-starved cells, AGK expression increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, notably a 170-kD band, which was similarly increased by serum in vector transfectants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Kinetic analysis revealed that the 170-kD tyrosine phosphorylation induced by serum was a rapid event in AGK-expressing cells, clearly evident within 5 min and remaining elevated for at least 60 min (Fig. S4 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200407123/DC1</ext-link>). The enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kD protein represented activation of the EGFR, as immunoblotting of anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine revealed increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in cells overexpressing AGK, even in the absence of serum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C).</p>

        <title>AGK-induced extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation requires EGFR</title>
        <p>Previously, it has been suggested that EGFR activation is required for signal relay from LPA receptors to ERK1/2 activation in prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kue et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2002</xref>). AGK expression markedly increased activation of ERK1/2, as determined with a phospho-specific antibody, which was further enhanced by serum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B) and EGF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D and Fig. S3 C). To further confirm that activation of the EGFR was necessary for AGK-stimulated ERK activation, we used the specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478. As expected, AG1478 abolished EGFR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. S4 B). AG1478 blocked AGK-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D) and decreased its mitogenic effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E) and also inhibited MOG-stimulated proliferation by 35 Â± 4%.

        <p>Serum and EGF induced significant increases in AGK expression as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). It has previously been shown that LPA itself is sufficient to increase its own production in PC-3 cells, indicating the presence of an autocrine network (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with an autocrine function for LPA, we found that LPA also increased expression of AGK by threefold in naÃ¯ve PC-3 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). To examine the physiological function of AGK, its expression was down-regulated with small interfering RNA (siRNA). siAGK, but not control siRNA, markedly reduced AGK mRNA in PC-3 cells, as determined by QPCR, without influencing expression of SphK1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). Consistent with its role in synthesis of LPA and PA, the most striking effect of down-regulating AGK was reduction of mitochondrial PA and LPA by â¼30% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). Remarkably, siAGK completely blocked stimulation of ERK1/2 induced by EGF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D).

Importantly, both of these siRNAs also markedly reduced EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation but did not decrease LPA-induced ERK activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> E), suggesting that LPA can bypass the effects of down-regulation of AGK.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Several lines of evidence suggest that AGK is a bona fide acylglycerol kinase. First, recombinant AGK catalyzes the phosphorylation of both MOG and DAG in vitro, producing LPA and PA, respectively. In agreement, bacterially expressed, purified recombinant AGK phosphorylated DAG as well as MOG (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Waggoner et al., 2004</xref>). Second, overexpression of AGK increases cellular levels of LPA and PA. Third, and conversely, down-regulation of AGK reduces their intracellular levels. Fourth, overexpression of kinase dead AGK, although localized similarly to the mitochondria as wild-type AGK, does not increase acylglycerol kinase activity nor produce LPA.</p>
      <p>Prostate carcinomas often possess an autocrine stimulatory loop in which the transformed cells express high levels of EGFR and also produce activating ligands. One such ligand might be the bioactive phospholipid LPA, which stimulates prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and survival, not only by acting on its cognate GPCRs but also by stimulating metalloproteinase activity and proteolytic EGF precursor processing leading to EGFR transactivation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gschwind et al., 2001</xref>). Our identification of AGK as a lipid kinase that produces LPA and PA and is highly expressed in prostate tumors may have important clinical implications with regard to advanced prostate cancer. AGK not only regulates mitogenic EGFR signaling that plays important roles in androgen-refractory metastatic prostate cancer but also stimulates cell motility and EGFR-independent secretion of the pluripotent cytokine IL-8. Indeed, blockade of the EGFR in PC-3 cells inhibited tumor growth and invasion and also down-regulated expression of IL-8 within the tumors (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Karashima et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG potently inhibit proliferation and cause apoptosis of PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Melck et al., 2000</xref>). Because AGK can phosphorylate 2-AG converting it to LPA, it may regulate the dynamic levels of these counterregulatory lipids that have been shown to play opposing roles in growth and survival of prostate cancers. Of note, LPA<sub>3</sub> was originally cloned from prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Im et al., 2000</xref>), which is concordant with the ability of LPA to induce autocrine proliferation of these cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, PC-3 cells express LPA<sub>1-3</sub> receptors, thus providing AGK with the potential to activate numerous downstream growth signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>The mitogenic responses of some mammalian cells to LPA may be LPA<sub>1-4</sub> independent (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hooks et al., 2001</xref>). However, in prostate cancer cells, LPA transduces mitogenic signals via activation of G<sub>Î±i</sub> and GÎ²Î³ subunits (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kue and Daaka, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bookout et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, the expression of GRK2ct inhibited PC-3 tumor formation in animals (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bookout et al., 2003</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that the growth-promoting effects of AGK are mediated via LPA receptors. In RH7777 cells, which are devoid of LPA<sub>1-4</sub>, expression of AGK had no effect on DNA synthesis, even in the presence of exogenous MOG. Moreover, PTX pretreatment decreased the growth-promoting effects of AGK. Our results are similar to others showing that PTX not only inhibits proliferation of PC-3 cells induced by LPA but also inhibits the effect of serum more drastically (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kue and Daaka, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with a previous study (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lea et al., 2004</xref>), GW9662, a selective antagonist of PPARÎ³, inhibited proliferation of vector-transfected PC-3 cells, and yet it did not abrogate the mitogenic effect of AGK. Our results are consistent with the notion that production and secretion of LPA by AGK induces Gi-dependent proliferation, likely through LPA receptors. Remarkably, down-regulation of AGK drastically reduced ERK1/2 activation induced by EGF, which, as expected, was bypassed by addition of the AGK product, LPA. Our data suggest that AGK plays an important role in EGF-induced mitogenic ERK signaling. AGK also phosphorylates DAG to produce the bioactive mediator PA, which regulates numerous biological processes including Raf translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rizzo et al., 1999</xref>) and activation of mTOR (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2001</xref>). Our results also imply that specific pools of PA may play important roles in growth signaling.</p>
      <p>Although the physiological function of LPA and PA generation in the mitochondria is not clear, a LPA phosphatase with 28.5% amino acid identity to human prostatic acid phosphatase is also localized to the mitochondria (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hiroyama and Takenawa, 1999</xref>). This LPA phosphatase has been suggested to regulate lipid metabolism in mitochondria by hydrolysis of LPA to monoacylglycerol (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hiroyama and Takenawa, 1999</xref>). Previous studies suggest that mitochondria-produced LPA can leave this organelle and be transported to the ER in the presence of liver fatty acid binding protein, can be secreted, and/or can be converted to PA (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Haldar and Lipfert, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hiroyama and Takenawa, 1999</xref>). In addition, LPA generated by prostate cancer cells in response to mitogenic stimuli can be secreted (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kue and Daaka, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kue et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that in both PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, agonists induce 18:1 LPA formation that is then released into the medium (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2002</xref>). As Du145 and PC-3 cells express LPA<sub>1-3</sub>, it was suggested that 18:1 LPA can act as an autocrine mediator (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2002</xref>), yet the critical enzymes involved have not been identified. Our data suggest that AGK could be a missing link. Production of LPA by AGK, which in turn transactivates the EGFR, can amplify mitogenic and survival signals. Moreover, expression of AGK is stimulated by EGF, serum, and even by LPA itself, thereby providing a positive feed-forward stimulus that could further enhance EGFR-dependent and -independent processes important for cancer progression. Therefore, targeting AGK, which is upstream of the EGFR, could offer additional therapeutic benefits in treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.</p>

        <title>Cloning of an AGK</title>
        <p>An EST (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW321722">AW321722</ext-link>) was identified that contained an open reading frame with 25% identity and 50% similarity to hSphK2 from aa 133 to 256. 5â² and 3â² RACE were performed using the GeneRacer kit (Life Technologies) to obtain the sequence of the full-length open reading frame. A cDNA with a complete open reading frame was cloned from a human kidney cDNA library encoding a 422âamino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 46,400 D (Fig. S1). A nearly identical mouse homologue (<ext-link ext-link-type="genpept" xlink:href="CAC06108">CAC06108</ext-link>) was also identified.</p>
        <p>The predicted sequence of this human protein and its mouse homologue identified from the mouse database (<ext-link ext-link-type="genpept" xlink:href="CAC06108">CAC06108</ext-link>) are 95% identical and both show sequence similarity to SphKs, especially in the five conserved SphK domains (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). We previously noted that conserved regions 1â3 of SphKs have high sequence homology with the catalytic domain of DAGKs (DAGKc; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). This region (aa 65 to 191 of the new kinase) contains the GDGXXXEXXXGXXXRX<sub>n</sub>K (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 8) motif, present in the catalytic domain of SphKs (SphKc; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), which is reminiscent but distinct from the sequence GGDGXXG previously suggested to be part of the ATP binding site of DAGKc (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Topham and Prescott, 1999</xref>). Of note, a lysine residue downstream of the glycine-rich region, which is conserved in the ATP binding sites of protein kinases (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hanks et al., 1988</xref>) and absent in DAGKc, is also present in SphKc and in this new lipid kinase (Fig. S1). However, Clustal W alignment revealed that hSphK1 and hSphK2 are more closely related to each other than to this new putative lipid kinase. Pairwise comparisons of the conserved subdomains of SphK1/SphK2, new lipid kinase/SphK1, new lipid kinase/SphK2, new lipid kinase/CERK, and new lipid kinase/DAGK indicated sequence identities of 53, 29, 23, 26, and 24%, respectively. These comparisons suggest that this new lipid kinase may be unique. A search of the human genome database revealed that the gene encoding this lipid kinase is located on chromosome 7q34, whereas SphK1 and SphK2 have been localized to chromosomes 17q25.2 and 19q13.2, respectively.</p>
