      <abstract>
        <p>Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling plays a central role in development and is also involved in a diverse array of diseases. Binding of Wnts to the coreceptors Frizzled and LRP6/5 leads to phosphorylation of PPPSPxS motifs in the LRP6/5 intracellular region and the inhibition of GSK3Î² bound to the scaffold protein Axin. However, it remains unknown how GSK3Î² is specifically inhibited upon Wnt stimulation. Here, we show that overexpression of the intracellular region of LRP6 containing a Ser/Thr rich cluster and a PPPSPxS motif impairs the activity of GSK3Î² in cells. Synthetic peptides containing the PPPSPxS motif strongly inhibit GSK3Î² <italic>in vitro</italic> only when they are phosphorylated. Microinjection of these peptides into <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos confirms that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif potentiates Wnt-induced second body axis formation. In addition, we show that the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6 plays an important role in LRP6 binding to GSK3Î². These observations demonstrate that phosphorylated LRP6/5 both recruits and directly inhibits GSK3Î² using two distinct portions of its cytoplasmic sequence, and suggest a novel mechanism of activation in this signaling pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway is essential for normal development, and is inappropriately activated in a number of cancers and other diseases <xref rid="pone.0004046-Wodarz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This signaling pathway functions by regulating the phosphorylation and degradation of the transcription co-activator Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0004046-He1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the absence of Wnt, Î²-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3Î² in a complex that includes Axin, GSK3Î², and Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0004046-He1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Phosphorylated Î²-catenin is targeted for degradation via phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination <xref rid="pone.0004046-Aberle1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Orford1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Wnt stimulation shuts off Î²-catenin degradation by inhibiting GSK3Î² in the Axin complex <xref rid="pone.0004046-Bienz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This inhibition is believed to be the key event in the activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Tamai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Wnt/Î²-catenin signal transduction is triggered at the plasma membrane by two distinct receptors, the serpentine receptor Frizzled, and the single-transmembrane receptor LRP6 or LRP5 (LRP6/5) <xref rid="pone.0004046-Tamai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004046-Kikuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The extracellular ligand Wnt is thought to promote the assembly of Frizzled, LRP6/5, the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled and the Axin complex, resulting in the sequential phosphorylation of two Ser/Thr residues in each of five cytoplasmic PPPSPxS motifs of LRP6/5 <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Bilic1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The PPPSPxS motif was proposed to be dually-phosphorylated by membrane-recruited GSK3Î² <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> in the Axin complex and membrane-localized CK1Î³ <xref rid="pone.0004046-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The dually-phosphorylated PPPSPxS motifs are known to mediate the interaction between LRP6/5 and the Axin complex <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which somehow leads to the activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that the overexpression of the intracellular region of LRP6 (residues 1417â1613 of the human sequence), a region that contains a Ser/Thr rich cluster and five PPPSPxS motifs, constitutively activated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and potentiated Wnt3a-induced Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This group also reported that the purified intracellular region of LRP6/5 attenuated GSK3Î² activity by 20% <italic>in vitro</italic>, strongly indicating that this region of LRP6/5 contains the inhibitory sequence targeting GSK3Î² and is thus responsible for activating the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway in cell <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mi2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Very recently, it was reported that an intracellular region of LRP6, which contains the Ser/Thr rich cluster and the five PPPSPxS motifs, inhibits the phosphorylation of Î²-catenin by GSK3Î², and that an intact PPPSPxS motif is required <xref rid="pone.0004046-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Davison et al. reported that a truncated receptor containing a transmembrane domain and a shorter fragment of LRP6 (residues 1460â1505; referred to as miniC), including the Ser/Thr rich cluster and the first PPPSPxS motif, can activate the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway <xref rid="pone.0004046-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In particular, they observed CK1-dependent phosphorylation of the PPPSPxS motif and the recruitment of Axin to the membrane, identifying these steps as crucial for the activation of the pathway <xref rid="pone.0004046-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the actual mechanism by which the GSK3Î² is inhibited in the Wnt signaling pathway has been obscure.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examine the actions of the intracellular region of LRP6/5 on GSK3Î² in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. We find that phosphorylated LRP6 binds to and directly inhibits GSK3Î², and that GSK3Î² can bridge LRP6 and Axin. These findings lead to a reinterpretation of earlier studies and allow us to propose a molecular mechanism for the activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>The LRP6 PPPSPxS motif can inhibit GSK3Î² both toward Î²-catenin and glycogen synthase</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that the intracellular LRP6 region acts as a direct GSK3Î² inhibitor in Wnt/Î²-catenin signal propagation. Within the intracellular region of LRP6, the miniC region of LRP6, especially the PPPSPxS motif, might be the GSK3Î² inhibitory sequence; replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP6 with this region can induce Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling even in the absence of the LRP6 extracellular region <xref rid="pone.0004046-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To test our hypothesis, we constructed a GFP-fusion protein based on LRP6-miniCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), which is similar to the miniC construct (this protein is called GFP-miniCL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We also constructed a mutant of LRP6-miniCL containing an Ala substitution at Ser1490 as a GFP-fusion construct (GFP-miniCLMT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We transfected the constructs into A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Figs. 1B and C</xref>) and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s001">Figs. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s002">S2</xref>) and analyzed the distribution, expression, and phosphorylation state of each construct, and their effects on Î²-catenin. Both wild type and mutant miniCL were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (GF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). However, only wild-type miniCL dramatically increased the total amount of cellular Î²-catenin and promoted the translocation of Î²-catenin into the nucleus (Î²-cat; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We consistently observed an increased level of Î²-catenin with the miniCL transfection in western blot analyses (Î²-catenin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). These observations are consistent with the results of Cselenyi et al., who used the LRP6 cytoplasmic region containing the Ser/Thr rich cluster and five PPPSPxS motifs, and variant in which the first Ser residue of each PPPSPxS motif is replaced by Ala <xref rid="pone.0004046-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To confirm the activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, we measured the transcriptional activity of Î²-catenin using luciferase in 293 cells. Forced cytoplasmic expression of wild type miniCL, but not the mutant miniCLMT, significantly induced TOP-flash activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the LRP6 miniCL works as an inhibitor of GSK3Î² regardless of its cellular localization, and that the PPPSPxS motif plays a crucial role in this effect.</p>

The Ser/Thr rich cluster and PPPSPxS motif are underlined in each sequence. Phosphorylated residues are highlighted. (B) Cytosolic overexpression of the LRP6 constructs. A549 cells in which control (empty vector, EV, encoding only GFP), miniCL and miniCLMT were transfected as GFP fusion proteins. Control, miniCL and miniCLMT were detected through the green fluorescence from GFP. Î²-Catenin was detected using an anti-Î²-catenin antibody, and the nuclei were detected by DAPI staining. (C) Western blotting analysis from the transfected A549 cells used in (B). Labels at the left side of blots indicate the antibody used for detection of the corresponding protein. Endogenous Î²-catenin was detected by an anti-Î²-catenin antibody. p-GS indicates the level of the phosphorylated GS by GSK3Î², detected by anti-glycogen synthase (Ser641) antibody. p-S9-GSK3Î² indicates the phosphorylated Ser9 of GSK3Î², and was detected by anti-phospho GSK3Î² (Ser9) antibody. Levels of transfected proteins were detected using monoclonal GFP antibody, indicated by GFP. Total cellular levels of GS and GSK3Î² were measured by anti-GS antibody and anti-GSK3Î² antibody, which are indicated by t-GS and t-GSK3Î², respectively. Actin is shown as a loading control. (D) Activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, which was measured by the Top-flash luciferase activity. Either the top-flash (<italic>TOP</italic>) or fop-flash (<italic>FOP</italic>) luciferase reporter and each construct were transfected into 293 cells. The luciferase activities were measured after 24 h of the transfection. Error bars represent standard deviation from 4 independent experiments. Statistical analysis revealed that overexpression of the miniCL construct significantly activated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling compared to that of the empty vector and the miniCLMT construct (* <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, # <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>

        <p>The wild-type miniCL, but not the mutant miniCLMT, also suppressed phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS; p-GS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) without the induction of phosphorylation of Ser9 in GSK3Î² (p-S9-GSK3Î²; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Suppression of GS phosphorylation normally occurs when GSK3Î² is phosphorylated at Ser9 by AKT as a part of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0004046-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our data indicate that the miniCL protein can inhibit GSK3Î² independently of AKT activity when this LRP6 fragment is overexpressed in the cytoplasm, implying that it can act as a general inhibitor of GSK3Î². Note that under physiological conditions, such inhibition would not occur due to the localization of the LRP6/GSK3Î²/Axin complex at the plasma membrane (see below).</p>

        <title>Phosphorylated PPPSPxS of LRP6/5 motif directly inhibits GSK3Î² <italic>in vitro</italic>
</title>
        <p>Since phosphorylation of the PPPSPxS motif in the miniCL region of LRP6/5 is correlated with the inhibition of GSK3Î², we asked whether the PPPSPxS motif can directly inhibit GSK3Î² <italic>in vitro</italic>. We synthesized one dually-phosphorylated (NPPP<bold><underline>pS</underline></bold>PA<bold><underline>pT</underline></bold>ERSH, where pS or pT designates a phosphorylated Ser or Thr residue), two singly-phosphorylated (NPPP<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>PA<bold><underline>pT</underline></bold>ERSH and NPPP<bold><underline>pS</underline></bold>PA<bold><underline>T</underline></bold>ERSH) and one non-phosphorylated (NPPP<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>PA<bold><underline>T</underline></bold>ERSH) peptides derived from the first PPPSPxS motif of LRP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To measure the GSK3Î² activity toward Î²-catenin <italic>in vitro</italic>, we utilized a Î²-catenin N-terminal fragment (residues 1â133), whose Ser45 was prephosphorylated by CK1, as a substrate (Ha et al., 2004). Each synthetic peptide was added to a reaction mixture containing the purified GSK3Î² enzyme and the substrate Î²-catenin N-terminal fragment. The GSK3Î² activity was determined through measurement of the intensity of the supershifted (retarded) Î²-catenin bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), which represent the phosphorylated product species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s003">Figs.

The dually-phosphorylated peptide showed a strong inhibitory effect on GSK3Î² in a concentration-dependent manner (1â100 ÂµM), while the non-phosphorylated peptide did not show any inhibitory effect on the GSK3Î² activity at concentrations up to 100 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The two singly-phosphorylated peptides showed distinct inhibitory effects. Whereas the peptide phosphorylated at the second Ser/Thr residue [PPPSPx(p)S; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>] exhibited only a marginal inhibitory effect at 100 ÂµM, the peptide phosphorylated at the first Ser/Thr [PPP(p)SPxS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>] exhibited a strong inhibitory effect close to that of the dually-phosphorylated peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the dually-phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif directly inhibits GSK3Î², and that phosphorylation at the first Ser residue plays a more important role. This corresponds well with the results of Zeng et al., who reported that the first Ser residue in the PPPSPxS motif has a more important role in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling than the second Ser residue <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Since the non-phosphorylated peptide does not inhibit, the inhibition is not due to competition between this potential alternative substrate and the Î²-catenin substrate.</p>

Varying concentrations (0, 1, 3, 10, and 30 ÂµM) of the dually-phosphorylated LRP6 peptide were used to measure the K<sub>i</sub> value. The data points are the mean of three independent experiments. The progressive increase in slope indicates that the K<sub>i</sub> for the peptide is â¼13 ÂµM. (C) The dually-phosphorylated PPPSPxS peptide inhibits the GSK3Î²-mediated phosphorylation of mouse Axin fragment (residues 512â650). The intensities of the Coomassie-blue stained phosphorylated bands were quantitatively analyzed. The purified Axin fragment (5 Âµg) was used as a substrate in the same reaction buffer as in (A). The graph is plotted as a percentage of uninhibited GSK3Î² activity from 3 independent experiments; the standard deviation is indicated by error bars. Gels used in this experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004046.s006">Fig. S6</xref>. (D) GSK3Î² is inhibited by the phosphorylated LRP6 motif independently of the Axin GBD protein (<italic>Left</italic>).

        <p>Based on steady-state kinetic analyses <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the dually phosphorylated LRP6 peptide competitively inhibits GSK3Î² with an apparent inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) of 13 ÂµM. Thus, the phosphorylated LRP6 motif is a much stronger inhibitor of GSK3Î² than the phosphorylated N-terminal fragment of GSK3Î² (K<sub>i</sub> â¼700 ÂµM), which is a known pseudosubstrate inhibitor of GSK3Î² <xref rid="pone.0004046-Dajani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>It was noted above that cytoplasmically expressed miniCL inhibits phosphorylation of GS. To further test whether the dually-phosphorylated PPPSPxS peptide can act as a general inhibitor of GSK3Î², we tested its effect on GSK3Î²-mediated phosphorylation of an Axin fragment (mouse Axin amino acids 512â650), in which Ser614 is the only site phosphorylated by GSK3Î² <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, the phosphorylated PPPSPxS peptides inhibited GSK3Î²-mediated phosphorylation of the Axin fragment as efficiently as on the primed Î²-catenin N-terminal fragment substrate. This result is consistent with the observation that the intracellular region of LRP6 decreased GSK3Î² phosphorylation of an unprimed substrate Tau protein and the primed substrate full-length Î²-catenin <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0004046-Mi2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, the phosphorylated PPPSPxS peptides did not show any inhibitory effect on CK1 when we use the unphosphorylated Î²-catenin fragment as a substrate (data not shown), confirming that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS peptide inhibits only GSK3Î².

An <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay with Axin-bound GSK3Î² was performed by adding the purified GSK3Î² binding domain (GBD) of Axin to the reaction mixture.

        <title>Microinjection of the peptide containing the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif into the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo potentiates Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling</title>
        <p>It is well established that Wnt signaling reduces GSK3Î² activity during development of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo <xref rid="pone.0004046-Dominguez1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and that the suppressed activity of GSK3Î² induces a second body axis in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo in the response to Wnt <xref rid="pone.0004046-He2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of the PPPSPxS motif on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, we injected the synthetic peptides into <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, along with a small amount of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8 that is insufficient to induce second body axis formation on its own. The dually-phosphorylated peptide [PPP(p)SPx(p)S; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g003">Fig. 3</xref>] strongly induced the second body axis, whereas the non-phosphorylated peptide [PPPSPxS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g003">Fig. 3</xref>] did not. The peptide phosphorylated at only the first Ser residue [PPP(p)SPxS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g003">Fig. 3</xref>] induced the second body axis with an efficiency comparable to that of the dually-phosphorylated peptide. This result indicates that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif can induce Wnt signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the amount injected is likely to be higher than physiological concentrations, it is interesting that microinjection of each peptide in the absence of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8 did not induce a second body axis (data not shown). It is likely that a slight reduction in the GSK3Î² activity due to the activity of the exogenous Wnt on the endogenous LRP6/5 is required for the peptide to cause a sufficient inhibition of GSK3Î² to trigger Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Moreover, even if the amount of peptide injected is well above physiological concentrations, the effect is specific to the phosphorylated peptide. Thus, the peptide injection experiments, when considered with the experiments using purified proteins, indicate that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif directly inhibits GSK3Î² and leads to the activation of Î²-catenin.</p>

        <p>It was recently reported that injection of a recombinant portion of the LRP6 cytoplasmic region containing the Ser/Thr rich cluster and the five PPPSPxS motifs induced a second body axis as effectively as the phosphorylated PPPSPxS peptide in the absence of the exogenously-added Wnt ligand, even when the LRP6 protein was not prephosphorylated by GSK3Î² and CK1 <xref rid="pone.0004046-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It seems likely that the longer fragment of the LRP6 cytoplasmic region is phosphorylated by endogenous kinases in the embryo, and has a stronger inhibitory effect on GSK3Î² due to the multiple PPPSPxS motifs. Also, as we show below, the Ser/Thr-rich region upstream of the PPPSPxS motifs, may have an important role in this process.</p>

The Axin-binding site found in vertebrate GSK3 <xref rid="pone.0004046-Dajani2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> is conserved in the yeast homolog. These observations suggest that GSK3 can associate directly with LRP6 and bridge LRP6 to Axin.</p>
        <p>We first investigated whether the intracellular region of LRP6 binds to GSK3Î² in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To detect binding, we used recombinant GST-fused LRP6 fragments (miniCL, miniCLMT, PPPSPxS, PPPAPxS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and GSK3Î² proteins in a far western binding assay. This assay is appropriate as the LRP6 cytoplasmic region is expected to be natively unstructured and therefore should not suffer from denaturation artifacts. Prior to the binding reaction, the GST-fused LRP6 fragments were phosphorylated by GSK3Î² and CK1 and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with GSK3Î², and bound GSK3Î² was detected with an anti-GSK3Î² antibody. GSK3Î² bound to GST-miniCL and GST-miniCLMT, but not GST-PPPSPxS or GST-PPPAPxS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Comparison with LRP6 that had not been phosphorylated revealed that phosphorylation enhanced the binding by four to five fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>

Since the S1490A mutation does not affect binding, these results suggest that the Ser/Thr rich cluster present in miniCL plays more important role in mediating the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of LRP6 with GSK3Î². Also, given the measured K<sub>i</sub> value of the single PPPSPxS motif, it was expected that the single PPPSPxS motif might exert a limited role in recruiting the GSK3Î².</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have provided evidence that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif of LRP6/5 directly inhibits GSK3Î². The dually-phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif acts as a competitive inhibitor with a K<sub>i</sub> of 13 ÂµM. Given this K<sub>i</sub> value, the inhibitory effect of phosphorylated LRP6 on GSK3Î² is relatively low compared to other cytoplasmic protein inhibitors, such as XIAP (K<sub>i</sub> toward caspase-3 â¼2 nM <xref rid="pone.0004046-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>), although it is a much stronger inhibitor than the phosphorylated N-terminal segment of GSK3Î² <italic>in trans</italic>. However, the weak inhibitory effect of the phosphorylated LRP6 on GSK3Î² could become important when GSK3Î² and LRP6 are both localized to the membrane, which would bring the enzyme and its inhibitor into close proximity. Moreover, the five PPPSPxS motifs could enhance the avidity of the interaction with GSK3.</p>
      <p>Cselenyi et al. (2008) found that the recombinant, nonphosphorylated LRP6 intracellular region at â¼4 ÂµM can inhibit Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3Î², but not Tau, another GSK3Î² substrate, which led these authors to propose that GSK3Î² phosphorylates LRP6 and that the phosphorylated species somehow specifically interferes with the Î²-cateninâGSK3Î² interaction rather than inhibiting the kinase. They argue that the inhibition of GSK3Î² observed by Mi et al. (2006) may have been due to the use of supraphysiological concentrations, although the concentrations used in that study were not reported. We have shown that phosphorylated LRP6 inhibits GSK3Î² activity towards another substrate, Axin, in a purified system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), arguing against a Î²-catenin specific inhibitory activity. We also see inhibition of glycogen synthase when the LRP6 cytoplasmic fragment is overexpressed in cells. Although in this case a free cytosolic LRP6 motif is clearly not physiological, taken with the other data it is clear that the phosphorylated motif can act as a competitive inhibitor of GSK3Î². The 13 ÂµM K<sub>i</sub> is consistent with the findings of Cselenyi et al. when the avidity of the 5 PPPSPxS motifs is considered. Although the relevant concentration <italic>in vitro</italic> is not known, particularly given the formation of scaffolding complexes at the plasma membrane, it is clear that the phosphorylated motifs act as potent inhibitors.</p>
      <p>The cytoplasmic scaffold protein Dishevelled is an indispensible component downstream of Frizzled in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling <xref rid="pone.0004046-Wallingford1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A large body of evidence suggests that Dishevelled is responsible for the direct recruitment of Axin to the membrane in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, through the interaction of the Dishevelled and Axin DIX domains <xref rid="pone.0004046-Cliffe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004046-Yanagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In this study, we found that the miniCL intracellular region of LRP6/5 has two functional modules, each regulated by their phosphorylation state: the Ser/Thr rich cluster appears to contribute to the binding of GSK3Î², and the PPPSPxS motifs regulate GSK3Î² activity. The interaction of the Ser/Thr rich cluster with GSK3Î² suggests that the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6/5 and Dishevelled may synergize in the recruitment of the GSK3Î²âAxin complex to the membrane upon Wnt stimulation. Concurrently, GSK3Î² co-localized with Axin at the membrane would be inhibited by the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motifs of LRP6/5.</p>
      <p>Our findings suggest a mechanism to account for the role of phosphorylated LRP6 motifs in the initial events of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004046-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Binding of Wnt to the Frizzled and LRP6/5 receptors promotes binding of Dishevelled to the cytoplasmic region of Frizzled. This membrane-localized Dishevelled recruits the Axin complex mainly through the Axin-Dishevelled interaction and partly through the LRP6 Ser/Thr rich clusterâGSK3Î² interaction. The membrane-localized GSK3Î² in the Axin complex, together with CK1Î³, phosphorylates the intracellular region of LRP6/5, including the Ser/Thr rich cluster and the five PPPSPxS motifs. The phosphorylated Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6/5 has a higher affinity for GSK3Î², and may help to maintain the Axin complex at the membrane in conjunction with the Dishevelled-Axin interaction. Finally, GSK3Î² in the plasma membrane-localized Axin complexes is inhibited by the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motifs of LRP6/5. According to this model, the cytoplasmic GSK3Î² molecules involved in insulin/IGF-1 signaling would not be recruited to the membrane because of the lack of the Dishevelled-Axin interaction. As such, this model is compatible with the observation that free cytoplasmic GSK3Î² is not inhibited in response to Wnt stimulation <xref rid="pone.0004046-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Pearl1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, thereby insulating the insulin/IGF-1 signaling from the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.</p>

<italic>Left</italic>, simultaneous binding of Wnt to Frizzled (<italic>Fz</italic>) and LRP6/5 leads to recruitment of Dishevelled (<italic>Dvl</italic>) to the Frizzled cytoplasmic region. <italic>Middle</italic>, the Axin complex containing GSK3Î² is recruited to the membrane via interactions of Axin with Dishevelled, and also the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6/5 with GSK3Î² in the complex. The membrane-recruited GSK3Î², together with the membrane-anchored CK1Î³, phosphorylates the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6. Once the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6/5 is phosphorylated, LRP6/5 makes a greater contribution to the recruitment of the Axin complex due to its increased affinity. <italic>Right</italic>, the GSK3Î² in the Axin complex is inhibited by the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif in LRP6/5. The phosphorylated Ser/Thr rich cluster is indicated by p in a square, and the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif is indicated by p in a circle.</p>

      <p>It was previously suggested that the roles of phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif are to recruit Î²-catenin <xref rid="pone.0004046-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and Axin <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mi2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, which would lead to inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3Î². Fluorescence resonant energy transfer between tagged proteins suggested that the LRP6 cytoplasmic region binds to Î²-catenin in the cell leading to the proposal that inhibition of Î²-catenin phosphorylation results from the association of the LRP6 region with Î²-catenin, not from the inhibition of GSK3Î² <xref rid="pone.0004046-Cselenyi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, we find that intracellular region of LRP6 directly binds to GSK3Î² through the Ser/Thr rich cluster and thereby mediates the recruitment of Axin, suggesting that Î²-catenin associates indirectly with LRP6 through GSK3Î² and Axin. Likewise, the ability of GSK3Î² to bind simultaneously to LRP6 and Axin explains earlier co-immunopreciptiation data <xref rid="pone.0004046-Mao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> that were used to conclude that LRP6 and Axin interact directly. In summary, our results show that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif of LRP6 acts as a direct inhibitor of GSK3Î² in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, and suggest a mechanism for stabilization of Î²-catenin upon activation of cell surface Wnt receptors.</p>
