      <abstract>
        <p>The chromatin remodeling protein ATRX, which targets tandem repetitive DNA, has been shown to be required for expression of the alpha globin genes, for proliferation of a variety of cellular progenitors, for chromosome congression and for the maintenance of telomeres. Mutations in ATRX have recently been identified in tumours which maintain their telomeres by a telomerase independent pathway involving homologous recombination thought to be triggered by DNA damage. It is as yet unknown whether there is a central underlying mechanism associated with ATRX dysfunction which can explain the numerous cellular phenomena observed. There is, however, growing evidence for its role in the replication of various repetitive DNA templates which are thought to have a propensity to form secondary structures. Using a mouse knockout model we demonstrate that ATRX plays a direct role in facilitating DNA replication. Ablation of ATRX alone, although leading to a DNA damage response at telomeres, is not sufficient to trigger the alternative lengthening of telomere pathway in mouse embryonic stem cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>ATRX is an SNF2-related chromatin remodelling protein which acts with the histone chaperone DAXX to insert the variant histone H3.3 into telomeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin <xref rid="pone.0092915-Goldberg1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Drane1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Constitutional mutations in ATRX give rise to alpha thalassaemia mental retardation, X-linked (ATR-X) syndrome <xref rid="pone.0092915-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The affected males exhibit severe intellectual disability, and multiple congenital abnormalities involving genital and skeletal development, as well as a characteristic facial appearance and many have alpha thalassaemia an anaemia which, in these individuals, is due to reduced alpha globin gene expression. Extensive studies in mouse have shown that absence of full- length ATRX leads to defective development of the trophoblast <xref rid="pone.0092915-Garrick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, loss of neurons in the CNS <xref rid="pone.0092915-Berube1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, lack of proliferation of myoblasts <xref rid="pone.0092915-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Sertoli cells <xref rid="pone.0092915-BagheriFam1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> as well as abnormal mitosis <xref rid="pone.0092915-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and meiosis <xref rid="pone.0092915-DeLaFuente1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is unclear however how all these diverse effects result from ATRX dysfunction.</p>
      <p>An important recent finding is that ATRX localises to G-rich tandem repeats including interstitial repeats and telomeres during S phase <xref rid="pone.0092915-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These sequences are thought to form secondary structures such as G quadruplex (G4) and indeed ATRX binds G4 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the absence of ATRX there is an increase in DNA damage at telomeres <xref rid="pone.0092915-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> raising the possibility that ATRX is required for the replication of these unusual DNA templates and that ATRX deficiency leads to replicative stress.</p>
      <p>Here we confirm and extend these important observations in a primary mouse cell line knocked out for ATRX and demonstrate a defect in S phase progression following an aphidicolin block, sensitivity to hydroxyurea, increased stalling of replication and an increase in double strand breaks (DSBs) as detected by 53BP1 foci and a neutral comet assay. These aspects of ATRX function may be particularly important at telomeres. It has previously been shown that, in telomerase negative tumour cells, viability is maintained via an alternative pathway (ALT) to lengthen telomeres. Furthermore, tumours with the ALT phenotype frequently harbour acquired somatic mutations in the ATRX gene <xref rid="pone.0092915-Heaphy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Schwartzentruber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Importantly, here we show that disruption of ATRX alone, in mouse embryonic stem cells, is not sufficient to trigger ALT and consequently other factors must contribute to this pathway. Here we used co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation, to identify other factors that interact with ATRX and found that in wild-type cells, endogenous ATRX associates with the MRN complex which is also known to play a part in generating the ALT phenotype. This study has further developed the evidence showing that ATRX plays a direct role in DNA repair, and together with MRN, may play an important role in the ALT pathway.</p>

        <title>Knockout of ATRX induces a DNA damage response in mouse embryonic stem cells</title>
        <p>We have previously generated mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell lines conditionally deleted for full length ATRX (<italic>Atrx<sup>null</sup></italic>) with their wildtype counterparts (<italic>Atrx</italic>
<sup>flox</sup>) mES cells <xref rid="pone.0092915-Garrick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Using these cell lines we sought to further characterise the cellular function of ATRX. In agreement with previous reports, loss of ATRX was associated with an increased DNA damage response, as detected by an increase in 53BP1 foci as well as an increase in telomeric 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g001">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>). We confirmed a higher frequency of DSBs, specifically, in the ATRX knockout using a neutral comet assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g001">Figure 1D and E</xref>). To investigate the origin of the increased DSBs in the ATRX knockout cells, clonogenic sensitivity assays were performed with a range of DNA damaging agents and DNA replication inhibitors. There was a modest increase in sensitivity in the <italic>Atrx</italic>
<sup>null</sup> cells upon treatment with the DNA replication stress inducing drug hydroxyurea (HU) but no response to other DNA replication inhibitors (camptothecin and aphidicolin) or DNA damaging agents (gamma-irradiation (IR) and cisplatin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Whilst camptothecin inhibits topoisomerase I and aphidicolin inhibits DNA polymerase, HU inhibits DNA replication by depleting dNTPs, resulting in extended regions of single-stranded DNA <xref rid="pone.0092915-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, likely leading to an increased probability of forming G4 structures. The specific sensitivity of the <italic>Atrx</italic>
<sup>null</sup> cells to HU is therefore consistent with a role for ATRX in processing G4 structures, as previously hypothesised <xref rid="pone.0092915-Clynes1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Replication fork progression was next analysed at single molecule resolution using DNA fibre analysis, a technique in which replicating cells are sequentially labelled with nucleotide analogues (iododeoxyuridine (IdU) and chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU)), lysed, the DNA fibres spread on glass slides, probed with specific antibodies and visualised by fluorescence microscopy <xref rid="pone.0092915-Schwab1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We initially assessed the effect of HU treatment on replication fork processivity in <italic>Atrx</italic>
<sup>flox</sup> and <italic>Atrx</italic>
<sup>null</sup> cells using this technique. Cells were pulsed for 10 minutes with IdU, followed by a 40-minute incubation with CldU and 1mM HU. For each replication fork the processivity was determined as the ratio of the length of IdU:CldU labelled DNA; higher ratios corresponding to lower processivity. While the majority of replication forks exhibited a comparable reduction in processivity upon HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the distribution was skewed with a significantly higher (pâ=â0.0021) frequency of very slow replicating forks in the <italic>Atrx</italic>
<sup>null</sup> cells. This indicates that, although not required globally for replication fork processivity, efficient replication of a subset of genomic loci is dependent on ATRX. In addition, this DNA fibre technique allows for the identification five major replication intermediates; elongating forks, origin firing, termination events, interspersed origins and stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0092915-Schwab1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Conti1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-MayaMendoza1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

        <p>It has recently been shown that ATRX mutations or the absence of ATRX protein is an almost invariant finding in cell lines exhibiting the ALT phenotype and that various cancers with features consistent with the ALT phenotype are frequently associated with mutations in ATRX, DAXX and/or H3.3 <xref rid="pone.0092915-Heaphy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Schwartzentruber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Lovejoy1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

The cellular context, including the telomerase negative status of cells, must therefore be an important additional factor in the development of the ALT pathway.

        <title>ATRX interacts with the MRN complex</title>
        <p>It is therefore clear that loss of ATRX function alone is insufficient to trigger the ALT pathway. To explore further the mechanism by which ATRX prevents replication stress/genomic instability and suppresses the ALT pathway we used co-immunoprecipitation to identify proteins interacting with endogenous ATRX. Using a polyclonal antibody raised to the C-terminus of ATRX (H300), ATRX interaction partners were immune-isolated from a HeLa nuclear extract and resolved by SDS PAGE gel electrophoresis. Three major bands were analysed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition to ATRX and its known partner DAXX, a third protein (RAD50) was identified as a novel interaction partner. The co-immunoprecipitation reaction was repeated using an antibody raised to the N-terminus of ATRX (39F) and in this case all immune-isolated protein was subject to identification by mass spectrometry. RAD50, MRE11 and NBS1, the three components of the MRN complex <xref rid="pone.0092915-Trujillo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

        <p>The MRN complex has many known functions including: double strand break repair (via both HR and NHEJ) and the restart of stalled replication forks <xref rid="pone.0092915-Robison1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We addressed whether ATRX normally co-localises with the MRN complex by dual indirect immuno-fluoresence in HeLa cells. Approximately 5 â 10% of unsynchronised HeLa cells exhibit nuclear foci containing both RAD50 and MRE11 associated with DNA damage. In 88% of these cells, ATRX co-localised with at least one of these RAD50/MRE11 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g005">Figure 5D, E and F</xref>). Furthermore, all subnuclear foci in which ATRX was associated with RAD50/MRE11 were found in nuclei which stained positive for PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092915-g005">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that the association of ATRX and the MRN complex occurs during S phase. Analogous results were obtained in mES cells, suggesting that this interaction is not confined to HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092915.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Together these data provide evidence that the ATRX/DAXX complex interacts with the MRN complex during DNA replication and is likely to play a direct role in facilitating this process.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we show that a conditional deletion of full length ATRX in primary mouse ES cells undergoing replicative stress, leads to a prolongation in S-phase, concomitant accumulation of gamma-H2AX and an increase in fork stalling. Notably, loss of ATRX elicits an apparent defect in late S phase, which likely includes replication of repetitive, heterochromatic sites, known targets of ATRX binding <xref rid="pone.0092915-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In accordance with this, ATRX is not generally required for fork processivity but instead appears to be required for the efficient replication of a subset of genomic loci. Although in this study we were unable to identify these sites it is likely that they represent late replicating ATRX target sites.</p>
      <p>This model has gained support from a number of complementary studies. Ablation of ATRX in mouse myoblasts delayed their progression in S phase and led to an accumulation of DNA damage including telomere fragility <xref rid="pone.0092915-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and similar findings were observed in a study involving neuroprogenitors <xref rid="pone.0092915-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In a further advance, a somatic knockout of ATRX in a colorectal cell line exhibited increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea and aphidicolin suggesting that in the absence of ATRX there is an increase in replicative stress in this cellular context <xref rid="pone.0092915-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Taken together with the findings presented here it is clear that ATRX has a general role in facilitating DNA replication in multiple cellular environments and that this may in part account for why loss of ATRX function results in such disparate pathologies. Given the role reported here in ES cells it is likely that this function is also relevant in normal development.</p>
      <p>A large proportion of ATRX target sites are predicted to adopt non-B form secondary structures, including the G-quadruplex conformation <xref rid="pone.0092915-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Accumulating evidence suggests that the presence of such secondary structures serve as a barrier to replication fork progression, leading to fork stalling or collapse <xref rid="pone.0092915-Sarkies1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Paeschke1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Sarkies2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It is therefore tempting to think that ATRX is responsible for preventing the formation and/or accumulation of such structures at its repetitive target sites, thereby facilitating replication. This hypothesis is supported by the particular sensitivity of <italic>Atrx<sup>null</sup></italic> cells to hydroxyurea, a replication inhibitor that increases the likelihood of G4 formation. Moreover, in line with these observations, <italic>Atrx<sup>null</sup></italic> neuroprogenitor cells have recently been shown to be sensitive to the G-quadruplex stabilising ligand telomestatin <xref rid="pone.0092915-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, lending weight to the notion that ATRX aids the replication of G-quadruplex structures. Here we have shown that ATRX does not itself appear to possess G-quadruplex unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0092915.s003">Figure S3</xref>) suggesting that ATRX must overcome these impediments indirectly, perhaps by facilitating histone H3.3 deposition to maintain DNA in the B-form, or alternatively by promoting fork bypass via a process such as template switching. Further work is needed to determine where ATRX functions, physically and temporally, in relation to the replication fork.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a role for ATRX in facilitating replication through potential G-quadruplex forming sequences may shed light on its recently ascribed role as a tumor suppressor in a specific subset of malignancies that depend on a telomerase-independent pathway of telomere maintenance called the âalternative lengthening of telomeresâ (ALT) pathway <xref rid="pone.0092915-Heaphy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Schwartzentruber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Lovejoy1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. ALT is thought to depend on recombination between telomeric sequences <xref rid="pone.0092915-Cesare1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and therefore one could envisage that the presence of G-quadruplex structures in the absence of ATRX and subsequent fork stalling may serve as a trigger for HR. We note that telomere length remains largely unperturbed in the <italic>Atrx<sup>null</sup></italic> cells, thereby suggesting that loss of ATRX alone is not sufficient to trigger ALT in this cellular context. It is therefore obviously of interest to determine the additional requirements for ALT activation.</p>
      <p>By co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrate an interaction between endogenous ATRX and components of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex during S phase and a similar finding, using an expressed tagged ATRX transgene, has recently been reported<xref rid="pone.0092915-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Like ATRX, the MRN complex localises to telomeres during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0092915-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Verdun1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and interestingly G-quadruplexes are a preferred substrate for MRE11<xref rid="pone.0092915-Ghosal1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. MRN has many known functions important for genomic stability and replication, including the repair of double strand breaks (via both HR and NHEJ) and the restart of stalled replication forks. Furthermore the MRN complex is required for ALT <xref rid="pone.0092915-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> It is likely that the interaction between ATRX and MRN is important to the role of ATRX in facilitating replication and genomic stability <xref rid="pone.0092915-Robison1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092915-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It will be of considerable interest in future studies to determine the mechanism by which ATRX suppresses ALT and whether the interaction between ATRX and MRN plays a role in this process.</p>
