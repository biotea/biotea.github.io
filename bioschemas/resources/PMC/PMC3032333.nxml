      <abstract>
        <p>Yes-associated protein (YAP) regulates DNA damage and chemosensitivity, as well as functioning as a pro-growth, cell size regulator. For both of its roles, regulation by phosphorylation is crucial. We undertook an <italic>in vitro</italic> screen to identify novel YAP kinases to discover new signaling pathways to better understand YAP's function. We identified JNK1 and JNK2 as robust YAP kinases, as well as mapped multiple sites of phosphorylation. Using inhibitors and siRNA, we showed that JNK specifically phosphorylates endogenous YAP in a number of cell types. We show that YAP protects keratinocytes from UV irradiation but promotes UV-induced apoptosis in a squamous cell carcinoma. We defined the mechanism for this dual role to be YAP's ability to bind and stabilize the pro-proliferative ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> isoform in a JNK-dependent manner. Our report indicates that an evaluation of the expression of the different isoforms of p63 and p73 is crucial in determining YAP's function.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Yes-associated protein (YAP) was originally found as a phosphoprotein that bound to the SH3 domain of the Src-family kinase Yes, but was soon shown to define a novel protein-binding module, the WW domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Subsequent work has determined that YAP functions as a transcription modulator, binding to a number of transcription factors, including RUNX2, p73, members of the TEAD family and the C-terminal fragment of Erb-B4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p>
    <p>A number of functional studies of mammalian cells have implicated YAP as a proapoptotic regulator. Upon DNA damage, YAP binds to p73 downstream and promotes the selective transcription by p73 of a number of proapoptotic genes such as BAX and PIG3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> YAP and p73 form a complex with regulatory proteins, including the p300 acetyltransferase and the pro-myelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor-suppressor protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Whereas phosphorylation of YAP by the pro-survival Akt serine/threonine kinase inhibits the binding of YAP and p73, this binding is enhanced by phosphorylation of YAP by the DNA-damage c-Abl tyrosine kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, YAP also stabilizes p73 by displacing the ITCH E3 ubiquitin ligase by competitive binding, further activating cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Conversely, YAP has also been identified recently as a pro-growth, cell size regulator in both <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mammalian cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In contrast to regulating apoptosis by activation of p73, the growth control role of YAP or its fly homolog, Yorkie (Yki), is due to inactivation by the MST2 (HIPPO in fly) pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Here, the tumor-suppressor LATS1 kinase (WTS in fly) directly phosphorylates YAP (Yki), inhibiting its co-activation of the TEAD (Scalloped in fly) transcription factor to upregulate pro-growth genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> However, phosphorylation of YAP by MST2/LATS1 has also been shown to enhance p73 binding and subsequent apoptosis downstream from Fas in human breast cancer cells and chemotherapy in leukemia cells, as well as overexpression of pathway members in HEK293 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Clearly, phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for YAP. To further understand the role of YAP, we sought to discover new signaling pathways that regulate YAP's function. We wished to identify kinases that directly phosphorylate YAP and then functionally characterize the phosphorylation in cells in the context of apoptosis. To this end, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> screen using recombinant YAP and a panel of recombinant, active kinases. We selected the kinases on the basis of their putative phosphorylation site motifs expressed in YAP. Here we report the identification of JNK1 and JNK2 as kinases that robustly phosphorylate YAP and regulate its function in apoptosis.</p>

        <title>Identification of JNK as a YAP kinase</title>
        <p>To find novel YAP kinases, a panel of 29 recombinant, candidate kinases was screened for <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of recombinant YAP1. YAP phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography of the SDS-PAGE fractionation of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase reactions and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Specific activities of candidate kinases were validated by using phosphorylation of control peptides (Supplementary Table S1). We identified JNK1 (variant JNK1<italic>Î±</italic>1) and JNK2 (variant JNK2<italic>Î±</italic>2) as strong YAP kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, ERK2 and PKC<italic>Î±</italic> were also identified as moderate, and CaMKII, PKC<italic>Î³</italic> and PKC<italic>Î¸</italic> as weak, YAP kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). On the basis of these initial findings and the well-characterized role of JNKs in regulating apoptosis and diseases such as cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> we focused our efforts to pursue JNKs as putative YAP kinases. We performed time courses of phosphorylation to determine whether both JNK1 and JNK2 phosphorylated YAP stoichiometrically <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A stepwise, time-dependent increase in YAP phosphorylation, as determined by <sup>32</sup>P incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, bottom panels for each kinase), was reflected through detectable molecular-weight (MW) shifts on Coomassie-stained gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, top panels). These results suggest that both JNK1 and JNK2 phosphorylated YAP on multiple sites.</p>

        <title>JNK phosphorylates YAP on multiple sites</title>
        <p>To identify these sites, mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze recombinant YAP that had been incubated with either JNK1 or JNK2 for 60âmin for full phosphorylation, as evidenced by pronounced MW shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In total, five novel phosphorylation sites on YAP were identified: T119, S138, T154, S317 and T362 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Each of the serines and threonines are followed by a proline and therefore represent canonical JNK phosphorylation sites.</p>
        <p>To ascertain if JNK phosphorylates YAP on the same sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, we expressed a Flag-tagged YAP1 construct in 293 cells, followed by treatment with the potent JNK signaling activator, anisomycin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Immunoprecipitation (IP) of YAP from these cells showed a clear anisomycin-induced MW band shift in YAP, similar to that observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, by both Western blot analysis and Coomassie staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). LC-MS/MS analysis of the <italic>in vivo</italic> JNK-stimulated YAP identified three phosphorylation sites, S138, S317 and T362, all of which were also found from <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We mutated these residues individually to alanine to generate phospho-deficient constructs, along with the other two sites identified <italic>in vitro</italic>, T119 and T154. The wild-type and five mutated FlagâYAP constructs were expressed in U2OS cells, followed by treatment with anisomycin to determine what effect these mutations would have on the JNK-signature YAP band shift. The mutated constructs showed varying degrees of band shift upon anisomycin treatment, with the S317A and T362A mutants showing minimal shift, indicating that these two sites are most responsible for <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation induced MW shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>JNK specifically phosphorylates YAP <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>To determine whether JNK phosphorylates endogenous YAP1, we activated JNK by treating cells with anisomycin and detected the YAP band shift in a number of cells, including the HaCaT keratinocyte, U20S osteosarcoma, MCF-7 breast cancer and 293 human embryonic kidney cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We confirmed anisomycin activation of JNK by phosphorylation of its target, c-Jun,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This showed that JNK phosphorylation of YAP is not cell line-specific. To further confirm that the anisomycin-induced YAP band shift was due to JNK activation, U2OS cells were treated with a JNK-specific chemical inhibitor, SP600125,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> before anisomycin treatment. The inhibitor prevented JNK activation, as observed by a reduction in the phosphorylation of c-Jun, and prevented the YAP band shift induced by anisomycin (compare lanes 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, upper panel). Although our <italic>in vitro</italic> screen indicated that only JNK1 and JNK2, and not other stress-activated MAPKs, that is, the different p38 isoforms, phosphorylate YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table S1), we wished to rule out the possibility that the YAP band shift is due to anisomycin-induced p38 MAPK activation. HaCaT cells were pretreated with the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> before anisomycin treatment. Western blot analysis showed an anisomycin-induced shift in YAP in both untreated and treated cells, confirming that p38MAPK does not phosphorylate YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, lower panel). The same lysates were immunoblotted for the phosphorylated form of the direct p38 target, MAPKAPK2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> to show that SB203580 was effective in inhibiting p38's activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, lower panel). Furthermore, although we had identified ERK2 as a moderate YAP kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table S1), as expected, anisomycin did not activate ERK1 or ERK2 in these cells, as shown by immunoblotting with a phospho-ERK antibody (Supplementary Figure 1). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results confirm that JNK but not p38MAPKs phosphorylates endogenous YAP in cells.</p>
        <p>We attempted to raise phospho-specific antibodies against the S317 and T362, the two sites that were most responsible for <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation-dependent band shift of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), and were successful in generating a T362-specific antibody (pT362). The pT362 antibody was effective when used on immunoprecipitated YAP from anisomycin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), confirming our mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In these experiments, we monitored the anisomycin activation of JNK using a phospho-JNK antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Using short interfering RNA (siRNA), which effectively silenced both JNK 1 and JNK2, phosphorylation on threonine-362 of YAP was blocked by silencing JNK in both anisomycin-treated and untreated cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Blocking anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of YAP, as determined using the pT362 antibody, is consistent with our findings using the JNK-specific chemical inhibitor in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, further confirming that YAP is specifically phosphorylated by JNK <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
        <p>UV radiation is one of the best characterized and physiologically relevant activators of JNK signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> We assessed whether the same residues that we determined to be the critical sites of anisomycin-induced JNK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) were also sites of UV-induced phosphorylation of YAP. We expressed either a phospho-deficient YAP mutant, where S317 and T362 were mutated to alanine (S317A, T362A=mut2AYAP), or a phospho-mimetic YAP mutant, where the both residues were mutated to aspartate (S317D, T362D=mut2DYAP), or wild-type YAP in BWT squamous cell carcinoma cells. Western blot analysis shows that the mut2AYAP resolves at lower MW than wild-type YAP, indicative of a less phosphorylated state, whereas mut2DYAP resolves at a markedly higher MW, indicative of a hyper-phosphorylated state and mimicking the JNK phosphorylation-dependent band shift from previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Similar to anisomycin, UV-C treatment caused a band shift of wild-type YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Moreover, this shift resolved at an MW similar to untreated mut2DYAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Most tellingly, UV treatment did not result in a detectable band shift in either mutant YAP construct, showing that S317 and T362 are the main target sites for UV-induced YAP phosphorylation. To verify that UV exposure results in JNK-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous YAP, HaCaT cells were treated with a time course of UV-C radiation and YAP was immunoprecipitated and subsequently immunoblotted with the pT362 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, UV radiation results in robust phosphorylation of YAP, as early as 30âmin and sustained through to 2âh, similar to increase in c-Jun phosphorylation. Together, these results show that YAP is specifically phosphorylated by JNK upon UV radiation.</p>
        <p>YAP has been shown to signal apoptosis downstream from chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, as well as ionizing radiation and treatment with Fas ligand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> but the role of YAP in UV-induced apoptosis has not yet been investigated. We selected HaCaT as a model system, as UV-induced apoptosis is particularly physiologically relevant in keratinocytes and has been shown to be dependent on JNK in these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, we have shown JNK phosphorylation of YAP upon UV radiation in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). To study the effects of YAP expression in these cells, we generated control and YAP shRNA stable cell lines and subjected them to 50âJ/m<sup>2</sup> UV irradiation. At 24âh after treatment, 40% apoptosis was observed in the control cells (as measured by FACS analysis of Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, both early and late apoptosis). YAP silencing resulted in considerably more death, with 70% apoptosis evident in YAP shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2a). Noticeably, stable YAP loss alone did not cause death in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2a). YAP silencing and JNK activation as shown by phosphorylated c-Jun levels were maintained at 24âh of UV treatment (Supplementary Figure 2b). Western blot analysis of lysates from similarly treated cells showed that YAP silencing enhanced UV-induced PARP cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis, at time points as early as 2âh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Interestingly, anisomycin treatment, which resulted in comparable levels of JNK activity, as shown by phosphorylated c-Jun levels, also similarly enhanced PARP cleavage in YAP shRNA stable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These results indicate that YAP expression protects from UV-induced, JNK-mediated apoptosis in keratinocytes.</p>
        <p>As described earlier, this finding is contrary to what has been reported previously for YAP's role in other DNA-damaging stimuli in tumor-derived cells. We next examined how YAP's expression regulated UV-induced apoptosis in a skin cancer cell line. BWT squamous cell carcinoma cells treated with control siRNA subject to 30âJ/m<sup>2</sup> UV for 24âh resulted in over 40% total apoptosis as measured by FACS analysis. YAP siRNA-treated cells irradiated similarly were markedly protected from UV-induced cell death, showing only 18% apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, efficient silencing of YAP in these cells also inhibited UV-induced PARP cleavage at 6âh. To investigate whether JNK phosphorylation of YAP regulates its proapoptotic role in this skin cancer cell line, we expressed either an empty vector or the mut2DYAP plasmid and irradiated with UV as before. Tellingly, expression of the JNK-site phosphomimetic YAP construct alone resulted in a level of apoptosis similar as that observed with UV irradiation of the empty vector control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). This corroborated with our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> where we show that expression of mut2DYAP alone mimics the UV-induced band shift of wild-type YAP in BWT. In contrast to our results in HaCaT keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), these findings show that endogenous YAP expression promotes UV-induced apoptosis in BWT, in a JNK phosphorylation-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>JNK phosphorylation of YAP enhances its stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> by direct binding</title>
        <p>We have recently reported that YAP promotes cisplatin-induced, c-Jun-mediated apoptosis, in part by stabilizing the proapoptotic TAp73<italic>Î±</italic> isoform, a mechanism also shown by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> HaCaT cells more abundantly express the ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> isoform, which has been shown to be crucial for proliferation, differentiation and actually protective from p73-dependent cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> However, the PPXY motif required for YAP binding present on the longer isoforms of p73 is also conserved on ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> We examined whether YAP can also stabilize this protective p53-family member in a JNK-dependent manner. In HaCaT cells, silencing of endogenous YAP resulted in a striking decrease in the levels of endogenous ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Within the time frame indicated, UV treatment did not decrease the expression of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> in control cells but markedly did so in YAP-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Silencing of YAP had no effect on UV-induced JNK activation itself, as evidenced by phospho-c-Jun immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p>
        <p>We wished to verify whether YAP-dependent stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> is due to their direct binding, as was shown for YAP and TAp73Î±.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Unstimulated HaCaT cells showed basal binding of endogenous YAP and ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic>, as detected by co-IP with an anti-YAP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Strikingly, UV treatment induced rapid and sustained increase in the binding of endogenous YAP and ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), following the kinetics of YAP phosphorylation by UV radiation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p>
        <p>It was shown that YAP stabilized p73 in part by displacing the E3 ligase ITCH by competitive binding at the PPXY site on p73.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> ITCH was recently shown to bind and lead to degradation of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic>, as well as TAp73<italic>Î±</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> To further understand the mechanism behind the YAP-mediated stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic>, we assessed whether YAP stabilizes ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> by interfering with ITCH binding; HaCaT cells were transfected with either control or siRNA targeting ITCH. Consistent with our observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, co-IP with anti-p63<italic>Î±</italic> antibody reveals endogenous YAP-p63 binding in control HaCaT cells. Significantly, silencing endogenous ITCH in HaCaTs resulted in greater YAP-p63 binding as shown by increased YAP co-immunoprecipitated with p63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
        <p>To ensure that these finding were not specific to HaCaT cells, we assessed endogenous YAP stabilization of ÎNp63Î± in the H357 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma line, as ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> has been shown to be crucial for survival in this cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, silencing of endogenous YAP in these cells leads to decrease in ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> protein levels. Similar to HaCaT cells, ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> degradation resulting from YAP loss is exacerbated by UV irradiation in this head-and-neck cancer line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that silencing of YAP in H357 cells not only results in decreased ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> but also greater binding of endogenous ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> and ITCH as determined by markedly increased ITCH co-immunoprecipitated with p63 in YAP-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Together, these results show that YAP-mediated stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> occurs through competitive binding with the ITCH E3 ligase.</p>
        <p>To further validate that YAP binding and stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> are mediated by the JNK phospho-sites on YAP, we coexpressed ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> and either an empty control vector, wild-type YAP, mut2AYAP or mut2DYAP in U2OS cells. Complimentary to the effect of decreasing protein expression of endogenous ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> by silencing YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), ectopic expression of YAP stabilized coexpressed ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). This effect was enhanced with coexpression of the phosphomimetic mut2DYAP but not with mut2AYAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Furthermore, increased stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> by mut2DYAP correlated with increased binding of mut2DYAP to ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic>, as compared with wild-type YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), mimicking the effect of UV stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Together, these results indicate that YAP stabilization of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> is regulated by their direct binding and that it is induced by JNK phosphorylation.</p>

        <title>Expression of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> determines role of YAP in UV-induced apoptosis</title>
        <p>Western blot analysis showed that ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> expression is high in HaCaT, where YAP silencing promoted UV-induced apoptosis, and low in BWT where YAP promoted UV-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Furthermore, blotting with both pan-p63 and p63Î±-specific antibodies and MW comparison showed that ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> is by far the most prevalent p63 isoform expressed in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To verify whether there is a causal link between expression of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> and whether YAP expression promotes or protects from UV-induced apoptosis, we manipulated the expression of ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> in these cells and subjected them to UV irradiation. As expected, silencing endogenous ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> expression in HaCaTs exacerbated UV-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), while ectopically expressing ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic> in BWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) resulted in decrease in apoptosis upon UV treatment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results show that YAP is a direct substrate for JNK phosphorylation in a number of cell lines, both tumor-derived (U20S, MCF-7, BWT) and immortalized (293, HaCaT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We further show that JNK is stimulated to phosphorylate YAP upon UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), one of the most potent stress activators of the JNK pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The studies that show YAP to promote apoptosis most often used chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin, to induce cell death in tumor-derived cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Consistent with this role, YAP has recently been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in certain breast cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> However, YAP has been shown to be a pro-growth signal in development, most convincingly in fly development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and has also been implicated as an oncogene in a mouse model of liver cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> It has been hypothesized that the apparent contradiction in the function of YAP can be explained by YAP binding and subsequently either activating or inactivating different transcription factors, such as TAp73 to signal apoptosis and TEAD to signal growth, as determined by context DNA damage in adult tissue versus tissue growth in development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In contrast to what has been reported for other DNA-damaging signals, we show that YAP silencing enhances UV-induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), implicating a protective role for YAP in keratinocytes. However, we found that YAP promotes UV-induced cell death in BWT skin squamous cell carcinomas, further showing that is dependent on JNK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4câe</xref>). We show the mechanism behind this dual role of YAP in UV-induced apoptosis to be the ability of YAP to stabilize the pro-proliferative p53-family member, ÎNp63<italic>Î±</italic>, by direct binding, similar to what has been shown previously with the proapoptotic TAp73<italic>Î±</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Moreover, we show the binding and stabilization of these key signaling proteins to be JNK-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, our studies indicate that evaluation of the expression of the different p63/p73 isoforms, which can signal opposing cell biologies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> is crucial in determining the function of YAP, in different cell types, even subject to the same stress stimuli.</p>
      <p>Work on both DNA damage and tissue growth shows that phosphorylation is a crucial regulatory process for YAP's function. Although we identified and characterized JNK as a YAP kinase and a crucial regulator of its function, our initial <italic>in vitro</italic> screen also suggests that there are other kinases, besides those already published, that may directly phosphorylate YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Forthcoming studies will determine whether ERK2 and PKC<italic>Î±</italic>, which both exhibited moderate <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity toward YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1), are physiologically relevant YAP kinases and whether their activity also mediates YAP's regulation of apoptosis or growth. However, it is likely that to fully appreciate YAP's function in a particular context, an integrative approach to phosphorylation, as well as the other post-translational modifications reported for YAP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> will be required.</p>
