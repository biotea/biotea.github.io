      <abstract>
        <p>Histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me) is critical for epigenetic regulation and mutations at or near H3K36 are associated with distinct types of cancers. H3K36M dominantly inhibits H3K36me on wild-type histones, whereas H3G34R/V selectively affects H3K36me on the same histone tail. Here we report the crystal structures of SETD2 SET domain in complex with an H3K36M peptide and SAM or SAH. There are large conformational changes in the substrate binding regions of the SET domain, and the K36M residue interacts with the catalytic pocket of SETD2. H3G34 is surrounded by a very narrow tunnel, which excludes larger amino acid side chains. H3P38 is in the <italic>trans</italic> configuration, and the <italic>cis</italic> configuration is incompatible with SETD2 binding. Finally, mutations of H3G34 or H3P38 alleviate the inhibitory effects of H3K36M on H3K36me, demonstrating that the stable interaction of H3K36M with SETD2 is critical for its inhibitory effects.</p>

    <p>Residue-specific posttranslational methylation of histone lysines plays essential roles in every aspect of DNA metabolism such as transcription, DNA replication, recombination, and DNA damage repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Among them, methylation of H3K36 regulates diverse cellular processes and misregulation of H3K36 methyltransferases is associated with a number of human diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Interestingly, several of the recently identified oncogenic histone mutations are at or near H3K36. For example, the majority of chondroblastomas contain an H3K36M mutation, non-brainstem gliomas frequently contain H3G34R/V mutations, and giant cell tumors of the bone recurrently contain H3G34W/L mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Introducing an H3K36M transgene dominantly blocks H3K36me on wild type histones, whereas H3G34V or H3G34R transgenes selectively affect H3K36me on the mutated histones only<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In addition to these pathological mutations, alterations that prevent the isomerization of proline 38 also affect H3K36me<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, the mechanism by which these mutations regulate H3K36me is not well understood.</p>
    <p>In yeasts, a single H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 is responsible for all three degrees of H3K36 methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In contrast, multiple H3K36 methyltransferases are present in mammals, including NSD1, NSD2/MMSET, NSD3, ASH1L, SETD2, and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. NSD1, NSD2/MMSET, NSD3, and ASH1L are responsible for H3K36me2 and H3K36me1, whereas SETD2 is responsible for H3K36me3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Among these H3K36 methyltransferases, SETD2 is highly conserved across species. In addition, the enzymatic activity of SETD2 is inhibited by the H3K36M mutation, and SETD2 failed to methylate histone tails containing H3G34 mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, making it ideal to further study the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic histone mutations in regulating H3K36 methylation.</p>
    <p>Mutations of other methylated lysines into methionines also dominantly inhibit the methylation of corresponding lysine residues on wild type histones, suggesting that histone lysine-to-methionine mutations function through a similar mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We have previously shown that in fission yeast H3K9M-containing nucleosomes traps the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 at heterochromatin nucleation centers to block its spreading, therefore preventing the formation of large heterochromatin domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of H3K27M-containing nucleosomes copurified higher amounts of the H3K27 methyltransferase complex PRC2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and immunoprecipitation of H3K36M-containing nucleosomes showed higher levels of H3K36 methyltransferases such as SETD2 and NSD1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, NSD1 was not inhibited by H3K36M <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, raising the question whether H3K36M also functions through sequestration of H3K36 methyltransferases to affect H3K36me.</p>
    <p>We and others have shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that H3K9 methyltransferases such as Clr4 and mammalian G9a interact with K9M-containing histone H3 peptides in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for histone methyltransferases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Similarly, the interaction between the H3K27 methyltransferase PRC2 and an H3K27M peptide is also dependent on SAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Such interactions allow the crystallization of the ternary complexes for structural analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In this study, we solved the structures of an H3K36M peptide in complex with the catalytic SET domain of mammalian SETD2 and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), or S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), and revealed the detailed molecular mechanism by which SETD2 interacts with the histone H3 tail. The nearly identical SAM and SAH containing structures suggest that the methyl group of SAM is not important for interactions between SETD2 and H3K36M, which is different from other lysine-to-methionine mutations. Using the structure as a guide, we were able to generate mutations that reduce interactions between H3K36M and its methyltransferases, and show that the sequestration of SETD2/Set2 by H3K36M-contianing nucleosomes is essential for the inhibitory effects of the H3K36M mutation.</p>

        <title>The structure of the SETD2-H3K36M-SAM complex</title>
        <p>It has been shown that H3K36M-containing nucleosomes or peptides pull down SETD2 from nuclear extracts more efficiently than their wild type counterpart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To understand the molecular details of the interactions, we generated recombinant SET domain of SETD2 (residue 1435â1711, encompassing the AWS, SET, and post-SET regions) and an H3K36M peptide (29-APATGGVMKPHRYRP-43). We then determined the 2.42âÃ resolution crystal structure of the SET domain of SETD2 in complex with the H3K36M peptide and SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The atomic model has good agreement with the X-ray diffraction data and the expected bond lengths, bond angles and other geometric parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). All the residues are located in the preferred regions of the Ramachandran plot (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Clear electron density was observed for the entire H3K36M peptide and SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b and c</xref>) based on the crystallographic analysis. Residues 32â43 of the peptide assume an extended conformation, and residues 33â35 have anti-parallel interaction with a strand (residues 1668â1670) in the post-SET motif of SETD2. The last two residues of the peptide are projected away from the rest of SETD2. The conformation of Pro43 is likely stabilized through van der Waals interactions with the side chain of Tyr41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), and the Arg42 side chain is stabilized by crystal packing.</p>

        <title>The interaction of H3K36M with SETD2</title>
        <p>The K36M residue of histone H3 is located in the active site of SETD2, confirmed by the fact that a doubly methylated lysine residue (Mly9) of the H3K9 peptide is bound at a similar position in the SET domain of its methyltransferase GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The methionine side chain does not extend as deeply into the pocket as compared to the lysine side chain. It is surrounded by a collection of aromatic side chains (Tyr1579, Tyr1605, Phe1650, Phe1664, Tyr1666, Phe1668) as well as Met1607 from SETD2. The methyl group of K36M is pointed toward the side chain of Tyr1579, away from the direction of the Lys substrate. The binding mode for methionine is similar to that of the recently solved structures of G9a-K9M and PRC2-K27M<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, where the same residues that interact with the substrate lysine also interact with the mutated methionine residue.</p>
        <p>The methyl group of the cofactor SAM is pointed toward the K36M side chain of the peptide, but at a distance of 4.2âÃ to its sulfur atom and 4.3âÃ to its methyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting it does not directly mediate interaction with the methionine side chain. Therefore, the contribution of SAM to the interaction between SETD2 and H3K36M is mainly to stabilize the proper folding of the SET domain. Our structural data indicated that the electron density for the methyl group is weaker compared to the rest of SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that a mixture of SAM and SAH are present in this structure. As we only added SAM during crystallization, SAH is likely a degradation product, as has been observed before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We obtained another ternary complex structure at 2.4âÃ resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) where the electron density for the cofactor is more consistent with SAH (Extended data, Fig. 1). While our manuscript was under review, a similar structure of the SETD2-H3K36M-SAH complex was published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The SAM and SAH containing ternary complex structures are nearly identical (Extended data, Fig. 1). Therefore, the contribution of SAM and SAH to the interaction between SETD2 and H3K36M could be highly similar, which possibly stabilize the proper folding of the SET domain.</p>

        <title>Large conformational changes within SETD2 upon peptide binding</title>
        <p>Compared to the structure of SETD2 in a binary complex with SAH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, the overall structures of the AWS motif and the SET domain are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). But there are significant conformational changes for the post-SET motif of SETD2 upon binding of the peptide, with residues 1667â1675 assuming different conformations in the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Especially, residues 1669â1673 in the SAH binary complex directly overlap with residues 33â36 of the H3K36M peptide, and the side chain of Arg1670 is situated in the binding site for K36M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The conformation of residues 1667â1675 in the structure of SETD2 in complex with the inhibitor N-propyl sinefungin (Pr-SNF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> is more similar to that observed here (because the propyl group would clash with Arg1670 of the SAH binary complex), but residues 1669â1673 would still clash with the H3K36M peptide (Extended data Fig. 2). In addition, residues at the C-terminus (1692â1702) are disordered in the SAH binary complex and residues 1690â1691 have different conformations.</p>

        <title>The interaction of H3G34 with SETD2</title>
        <p>Besides allowing the peptide to bind, another important consequence of these structural changes is that residues Gly33-Gly34 of the peptide are completely buried in the complex. Most importantly, Gly34 of the peptide is surrounded by a very narrow tunnel, flanked by Phe1668 on one side and Tyr1671 on the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>) and mutations of these two residues into alanine completely abolished the enzymatic activity of SETD2 <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. There is essentially no space to accommodate larger side chains at Gly34, such as those of oncogenic histone mutations at H3G34 (Val, Leu, Arg, and Trp).</p>
        <p>To further test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of mutating H3G34 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since there are multiple histone H3K36 methyltransferases in mammals, which might not recognize H3K36 in the same fashion, we performed mutational analyses in fission yeast, which contains only a single H3K36 methyltransferase Set2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Set2 is highly conserved with human SETD2, and key residues required for the interactions with H3G34 and H3K36M are also conserved (Extended data, Fig. 3). This organism contains three histone H3 genes, <italic>hht1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>hht2</italic><sup>+</sup>, and <italic>hht3</italic><sup>+</sup>, with identical protein sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We generated a Flag-tagged version of H3 at the endogenous <italic>hht3</italic><sup>+</sup> chromosomal locus (<italic>hht3-Flag</italic>), which resulted in a higher molecular weight form of H3 that can be distinguished from endogenous H3. These cells still contain two wild type copies of histone H3 genes (<italic>hht1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>hht2</italic><sup>+</sup>). Western blot analyses showed that both forms of H3 contain H3K36me3, which were absent in <italic>set2â</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Moreover, <italic>hht3-K36M</italic> dominantly blocked H3K36me3 at endogenous H3, whereas <italic>hht3-K36R</italic> only affected H3K36me3 on the mutant H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), consistent with observations in mammalian systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We then introduced H3G34 mutations at the endogenous <italic>hht3</italic> locus, including the oncogenic Arg, Val, Leu, and Trp mutations or mutations to other amino acids with one or two carbon side chains (Ala, Cys, Ser, Asp, Asn, and Thr). All of these mutations severely affected H3K36me3 on the mutated histone H3 <italic>in cis</italic>, but had little effects on H3K36me3 on endogenous H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that H3G34 is very close to H3K36, it is possible that the loss of H3K36me3 on the mutated histones is due to effects on antibody recognition. To rule out this possibility, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> histone methyltransferase assays with recombinant SET domain of SETD2 and affinity purified heterotypic nucleosomes from fission yeast strains that contain both Flag-tagged mutant H3 and wild type endogenous H3. We then examined the incorporation of radioactively labeled methyl group by fluorography. The Flag-tagged wild type H3 is methylated as efficiently as the endogenous H3 by SETD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In contrast, Flag-tagged H3 containing mutations at H3G34 all showed severely reduced methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Therefore, the G34 position has little tolerance for mutations, which might explain why H3G34 is a hotspot for oncogenic histone mutations.</p>
        <p>We also tested the requirement of residues restricting the G34 recognition tunnel by mutating Tyr301 of Set2, which correspond to Tyr1671 of SETD2. Consistent with our hypothesis, the Y301L mutation, which has an intermediate side chain, mildly affected H3K36me3. In contrast, a Y301A mutation, which has a short side chain, reduced H3K36me3 levels even further (Extended data, Fig. 4), suggesting that a narrow G34 access channel is critical for recognition of the H3 tail by Set2.</p>

        <p>Isomerization of H3P38 by proline isomerase Frp4, which converts proline between <italic>trans</italic> and <italic>cis</italic> configurations, regulates H3K36 methylation by Set2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. As seen in our structure, Pro38 of H3 is bound in the <italic>trans</italic> configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), causing a ~90Â° twist in the backbone of the peptide. This allows residues C-terminal to P38 to make extensive contacts with SETD2. In contrast, a <italic>cis</italic> configuration of Pro38 is incompatible with the binding of the peptide to SETD2, as it will cause severe steric clashes between the histone tail and SETD2.

        <title>Mutations in H3G34 or H3P38 affects interaction between H3K36M and its methyltransferases</title>
        <p>We then tested whether G34 or P38 is required for the interaction between SETD2 and the histone H3 tail. Given that there is no detectable interaction between SETD2 and the wild type H3 peptide, we generated G34R or P38V mutation (which abolishes H3K36me3 <italic>in cis</italic> in budding yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) in the context of the H3K36M peptide. Thermal shift assay indicated that the H3G34RK36M and H3K36MP38V peptides could not stabilize SETD2 as efficiently as H3K36M in the presence SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and Extended data Fig. 5). Therefore, the G34R or P38V mutation affects the interaction between H3K36M and SETD2.</p>
        <p>We then tested the effects of G34R or P38V mutation on the ability of H3K36M peptide to inhibit SETD2 enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Consistent with previous findings, the H3K36M peptide inhibited the activity of SETD2 on recombinant nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In contrast, H3K36MP38V or H3K36MG34R peptide only had minor effects on SETD2 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Therefore, the stable interaction between H3K36M and SETD2 is required for its inhibitory effects.</p>
        <p>To further examine the effects of G34R and P38V on the ability of H3K36M to inhibit H3K36me3 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we introduced K36MP38V or G34RK36M mutations into the endogenous <italic>hht3</italic> locus in fission yeast. These mutants were efficiently incorporated into chromatin (Extended data Fig. 6). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of cells expressing Set2-myc and Hht3-K36M-Flag showed that Set2-myc interacted strongly with H3K36M containing nucleosomes compared to wild type nucleosomes, consistent with findings in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, the interaction was reduced in Hht3-K36MP38V or Hht3-G34RK36M expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Moreover, ChIP analysis showed that the localization of Set2 to one of its target genes <italic>tef3</italic> was increased in <italic>hht3-K36M</italic> cells, but reduced in <italic>hht3-G34RK36M</italic> or <italic>hht3-K36MP38V</italic> cells (Extended data Fig. 7). Consistent with the idea that the sequestration of H3K36 methyltransferases is responsible for the dominant effects of H3K36M, we found that H3K36me3 levels on wild type histones were significantly restored in <italic>hht3-G34RK36M</italic> and <italic>hht3-K36MP38V</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we solved the structures of a histone H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 in complex with a histone H3K36M peptide and SAM or SAH, which provides the molecular details about how this family of enzymes recognizes their histone substrate. The structural and functional data explain why many of the oncogenic mutations are concentrated at Gly34, and how they block H3K36 methylation. It also provides the molecular basis of Pro38 isomerization in regulating H3K36me. We further demonstrated the role of modulating H3K36M-H3K36 methyltransferase interactions in mitigating the effects of the oncogenic H3K36M mutation, which might be further explored to alleviate the toxicity of H3K36M mutation in cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Previous studies on the interaction between H3K9M and its methyltransferases such as Clr4 and G9a demonstrate that the interactions are critically dependent on the cofactor SAM. In contrast, the product of methylation reaction, SAH, has relatively little effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Therefore, it is interesting that we and others obtained the structure of SETD2 in complex with H3K36M and SAH (Extended data, Fig. 2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In fact, our SETD2-H3K36M-SAM structure showed that the methyl group of SAM has a lower electron density, most likely due to the degradation of SAM during crystallization. Such heterogeneity has no effects on the entire complex structure, suggesting that the methyl group does not contribute to the interaction. How the methyl group enhances the interaction between G9a and H3K9M is unknown, as the structure revealed that SAM is not directly involved in interaction with the methionine side chain either<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It is possible that H3K9M and H3K36M function through slightly different mechanisms in inhibiting the enzymatic activity of their corresponding methyltransferases. Such a difference might also have functional consequences as H3K9M can only inhibit Clr4 and G9a before the methylation reaction when the methyltransferases are still bound by SAM, whereas H3K36M can sequester its methyltransferases even after they have methylated wild type histones.</p>
      <p>H3K9 methyltransferases G9a and Clr4 are inhibited by the H3K9M mutation and the H3K27 methyltransferase PRC2 is inhibited by the H3K27M mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. These enzymes all show increased association with their corresponding lysine-to-methionine mutant histones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The prevailing hypothesis is that the increased association of lysine-to-methionine mutant histones with their corresponding histone methyltransferases sequesters the enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Indeed, we previously showed that reducing the interaction between H3K9M and Clr4 was able to alleviate the inhibitory effects of H3K9M<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, some H3K36 histone methyltransferases, such as NSD1 and ASHL1, are not inhibited by the H3K36M mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, but nonetheless show increased association with H3K36M containing nucleosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, therefore raising the possibility that mechanisms other than sequestration are responsible for the inhibitory effects of H3K36M. Our structural analyses revealed the essential roles of H3G34 and H3P38 in mediating the interaction of the H3 tail, thus providing an opportunity to test the contribution of increased association with H3K36 methyltransferase for the inhibitory effects of H3K36M. Indeed, additional mutations of H3G34 and H3P38V reduced the interaction between H3K36M and H3K36 methyltransferases and alleviate the effects of H3K36M both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, consistent with other lysine-to-methionine mutations H3K36M also functions through trapping of SETD2/Set2.</p>
      <p>It is not clear why SETD2 and NSD2 are inhibited by H3K36M, but NSD1 and ASHL1 are not. Comparison of H3K36 methyltransferases shows that residues mediating interactions with H3K36M are highly conserved (Extended Data, Fig. 4). The structure of NSD1 in complex with SAM showed that these residues also form a hydrophobic cage nearly identical to that of SETD2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Even more striking is that these residues are identical between NSD1 and NSD2, which are differentially inhibited by H3K36M<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Given that NSD1 also preferentially associates with H3K36M containing nucleosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, it is likely that NSD1 escapes the inhibitory effects of H3K36M through a mechanism different from regulating enzyme sequestration. It will be informative to obtain the structure of NSD1 in complex with H3K36M to determine the detailed interaction differences from SETD2. Such information will be important for understanding the mechanism by which the H3K36M mutation affects H3K36me and might offer new opportunities to alleviate the effects of H3K36M in cancer cells.</p>
