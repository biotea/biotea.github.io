      <abstract>
        <p>The nuclear envelope of metazoans disassembles during mitosis and reforms in late anaphase after sister chromatids have well separated. The coordination of these mitotic events is important for genome stability, yet the temporal control of nuclear envelope reassembly is unknown. Although the steps of nuclear formation have been extensively studied in vitro using the reconstitution system from egg extracts, the temporal control can only be studied in vivo. Here, we use time-lapse microscopy to investigate this process in living HeLa cells. We demonstrate that Cdk1 activity prevents premature nuclear envelope assembly and that phosphorylation of the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin B receptor (LBR) by Cdk1 contributes to the temporal control. We further identify a region in the nucleoplasmic domain of LBR that inhibits premature chromatin binding of the protein. We propose that this inhibitory effect is partly mediated by Cdk1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the reduced chromatin-binding ability of LBR together with Aurora B activity contributes to nuclear envelope breakdown. Our studies reveal for the first time a mechanism that controls the timing of nuclear envelope reassembly through modification of an integral nuclear membrane protein.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The nuclear envelope (NE) of eukaryotic cells serves to compartmentalize the cytoplasm and the nucleus. It is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is composed of inner and outer membranes that are joined by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Underneath the inner membrane is nuclear lamina made of a meshwork of the lamin protein, which maintains the structure of the nucleus and organizes the chromatin territories through interaction with inner membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hetzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In metazoans, the NE breaks down at the onset of mitosis and reassembles around the chromatin mass in late anaphase. These mitotic events must be coordinated spatially and temporally for proper segregation of the chromosomes.</p><p>Nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) begins with the stretching and tearing of the nuclear membrane by spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Beaudouin <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Salina <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Complete NEBD requires the depolymerization of nuclear lamina through phosphorylation of lamin by Cdk1 in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Heald and McKeon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Peter <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>). In addition, NPC components and several inner nuclear membrane proteins are also the substrates of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Courvalin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Macaulay <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dechat <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Phosphorylation of these components is important for the disassembly of NPC and NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Onischenko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Laurell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The breakdown of NE allows the spindle microtubules to capture and separate sister chromatids toward the opposite spindle poles. Subsequently, the NE assembles around the segregated chromatin mass to complete the nuclear division.</p><p>Reassembly of the NE has been best studied in vitro using extracts prepared from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and sea urchin eggs. These in vitro systems reveal that NE assembly involves chromatin recruitment of the precursor membrane vesicles, fusion of the vesicles on the chromatin surface, and insertion of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Vigers and Lohka, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Drummond <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Sasagawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The binding of membrane vesicles to the chromatin is inhibited by Cdk1 and requires type 1 or 2A protein phosphatase (PP1/2A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Pfaller <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The fusion of NE vesicles requires Ran GTPase, its nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hetzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Zhang and Clarke, 2000</xref>), and the chaperone p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Hetzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Despite the advances following from these in vitro studies, the mechanism underlying NE assembly in living cells remains largely unknown. In mitotic cells the disassembled NE membrane and some of its associated proteins are retrieved to the ER network after NEBD instead of forming membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Ellenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Daigle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). During NE reassembly, the end of tubular ER first attaches to the chromatin, followed by the flattening and spreading of the membrane on the chromatin surface with the help of ER-shaping proteins reticulon and DP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Anderson and Hetzer, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2008</xref>). With the insertion of NPC, the membrane eventually fuses to enwrap the whole chromatin mass.</p><p>Some of the inner nuclear membrane proteins are integral membrane proteins, including lamin B receptor (LBR), MAN1, emerin, and lamin Aâassociated protein Î² (LAP2Î²; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hetzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). These proteins remain associated with the ER after NEBD in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Ellenberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). RNA interference (RNAi) studies have shown that these proteins have redundant functions in NE assembly, as silencing any of these genes causes only a small delay, but the knockdown of multiple genes has an additive effect on NE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). However, the exact role of these proteins in NE reassembly is unclear.</p><p>LBR, originally identified as a binding protein of lamin B from the turkey erythrocyte, is a transmembrane protein residing on the inner nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Worman <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>). The protein contains a nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain followed by eight transmembrane domains and a small carboxyl-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Ye and Worman, 1994</xref>). The nucleoplasmic domain is capable of interacting with lamin B, heterochromatin protein 1, importin Î², and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Ye and Worman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Polioudaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). LBR has been shown to participate in NE assembly both in vitro and in vivo. The NE precursor vesicles containing LBR are able to associate with the sperm chromatin to initiate NE assembly in sea urchin egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Wilson and Newport, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Collas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Immunodepletion of LBR reduces chromatin recruitment of the NE vesicles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Pyrpasopoulou <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), and RNAi of LBR delays NE assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). LBR is phosphorylated in both interphase and mitosis. Phosphorylation at Ser-71 by Cdk1 in mitosis suppresses chromatin binding of the amino terminus of LBR in the egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Takano <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). However, the physiological significance of LBR phosphorylation in living cells is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the process of NE reassembly by time-lapse imaging of HeLa cells. We focus on how phosphorylation might affect the timing of NE reassembly at the end of mitosis. We also determine the functional significance of LBR phosphorylation in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Nuclear envelope assembly begins in late anaphase</title><p>To understand the timing mechanism underlying NE reassembly at the end of mitosis in vivo, we followed this process in HeLa cells by time-lapse microscopy. To visualize nuclear envelope, we expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)âtagged Sec61Î² as an ER marker because ER is the major source of the nuclear membrane for NE reassembly. We also expressed mCherry-tagged histone H2B for tracking chromosomes. At metaphase, the ER network was distributed in the whole cell except for the space occupied by the spindle and chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In early anaphase, sister chromatids were separated and pulled toward the spindle poles without apparent contact with the ER membrane. The chromosome arms shortened gradually and became a compact mass in late anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mora-Bermudez <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, the ER membrane began to attach to the edge of the chromatin mass near the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, 6 min). Following the initial attachment, the membrane quickly extended toward the central surface of the chromatin mass, first the polar region and then the area facing the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The NE completely enclosed the chromatin by 14 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and Supplemental Video S1).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>ER attachment to the chromatin initiates in late anaphase.

Thus we tested the possibility that Cdk1 might be involved in the temporal control of NE reformation. We introduced a high concentration (200 Î¼M) of the Cdk1 inhibitor roscovitine to cells in early metaphase during live-cell imaging in order to inhibit Cdk1 activity efficiently during the short window of anaphase. In vitro kinase assay shows that roscovitine only inhibits Cdk1 but not other mitotic kinases Aurora B and Plk1 at this concentration (Supplemental Figure S5). The addition of roscovitine caused massive chromosome bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and Supplemental Video S2). ER membrane labeled by GFP-LBR started to attach to several regions on the surface of the chromosomes in early anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, 2 min). The attached ER membrane moved along with the segregating chromosomes and then covered the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The NE formed quickly first on the outer surface of the chromatin and then extended to the inner surface along the chromosome bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and Supplemental Video S2). The average time of initial attachment was 2.2 min, which was much earlier than for the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)âtreated control cells (4.1 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Roscovitine also accelerated membrane attachment, as observed with GFP-Sec61Î²âexpressing cells (Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Video S2). Thus inhibition of Cdk1 activity leads to premature ER attachment, indicating that Cdk1 activity is important for the temporal control of NE assembly.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Inhibition of Cdk1 activity causes premature ER attachment to the chromatin.

Therefore, dephosphorylation of these substrates is probably required for the recruitment of ER membrane in late anaphase. The protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1/2A) have broad substrate specificity and are known to be involved in several aspects of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">De Wulf <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). To test whether PP1/2A activity might be required for NE reformation in cells, we inhibited the PP1/2A activity with calyculin A, which has good permeability for the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Namboodiripad and Jennings, 1996</xref>). Because the PP1/2A activity is required for establishing metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Sassoon <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), we added calyculin A to the culture medium immediately after anaphase onset during live-cell imaging. On calyculin A treatment, most of the cells failed to assemble a complete NE, as observed with GFP-LBR or GFP-Sec61Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, Supplemental Figure S2, and Supplemental Videos S3 and S4). In the most severe cases, ER membrane attached only to the edge of the chromatin mass, whereas the regions facing the spindle poles or midzone were devoid of membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, a</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S2A, a). In other cells, NE assembled but never completely covered the entire chromatin mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, b</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S2A, b). In addition, calyculin A treatment delayed the initial ER attachment in comparison with DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref> and S2C). During continuous incubation with calyculin A, the partially formed NE disassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, 20 min).

We wondered whether phosphorylation of LBR might affect the timing of NE assembly. The amino-terminal nucleoplasmic region (amino acids 1â208) of LBR contains four Ser/Thr-Pol motifs (Ser-71, Ser-86, Thr-118, and Thr-200) that are possible Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. To determine the phosphorylation, we generated recombinant proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the nucleoplasmic domain of LBR. The four possible phosphorylation sites of Cdk1 were completely replaced with alanine (4A) or in combinations of three (3A). Consistent with the previous finding that Ser-71 is a target for Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Takano <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), the wild type and the 3A/71S (71S 86A 118A 200A) mutant were phosphorylated to similar levels by Cdk1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, A and B</xref>), indicating that Ser-71 is the major phosphorylation site of Cdk1. In addition, 3A/86S (71A 86S 118A 200A) was phosphorylated by Cdk1 to â¼40% of the wild-type level, whereas 3A/T118 and 3A/T200 were barely phosphorylated by Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, A and B</xref>). Therefore, both Ser-71 and Ser-86 are phosphorylation sites of Cdk1.

Live imaging showed that GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> cells can undergo normal NEBD with complete dissociation of nuclear membrane from chromosomes before anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus the association of ER membrane with metaphase chromosomes was a consequence of premature ER attachment rather than incomplete dissociation of NE membrane after NEBD. Because GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> seems to bypass the inhibitory effect of Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), we suspect that another mitotic kinase besides Cdk1 might also inhibit premature ER attachment in early mitosis. A good candidate is Aurora B, which has multiple functions in mitosis and is located on prophase chromosomes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ruchaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). It was shown that Aurora B must be extracted from the chromosomes to allow NE assembly in frog egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Ramadan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). To test the possibility that Aurora B might be involved in the reassembly of the NE in mammalian cells, we added the specific Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 to cells that had just begun anaphase during live imaging. ZM447439 only inhibits Aurora B, but not Cdk1 or Plk1, at the concentration used in this study (Supplemental Figure S5). The addition of ZM447439 did not affect the timing of ER attachment as observed with GFP-Sec61Î² or GFP-LBR (Supplemental Figure S3 and Supplemental Video S7). The aberrant chromosome segregation and cytokinesis indicate that Aurora B was indeed inhibited (Supplemental Figure S3). Because Aurora B locates on the chromosomes only in prophase and translocates to the centromere in prometaphase, the protein might be involved in NEBD rather than NE assembly. We tested this possibility by adding ZM447439 to prophase cells. For the control of DMSO treatment, all of GFP-LBR and 88% of GFP-LBR<sup>AA</sup> cells completely dissociated NE from chromosomes within 10 min after NEBD, and 81% of GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> cells finished this process within 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and Supplemental Video S8). GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII-AA</sup> showed further delay, with 52% of the cells finishing this process within 20 min and 24% of the cells retaining patches of membrane on chromosomes even after 40 min (Supplemental Figure S4). ZM447439 treatment caused a small delay in the complete dissociation of NE membrane in both GFP-LBR and GFP-LBR<sup>AA</sup> compared with DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Of interest, most of GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> and GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII-AA</sup> cells treated with ZM447439 retained patches of nuclear membranes on chromosomes even at 40 min after NEBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and Supplemental Figure S4). Measurement of the average distance between chromatin and ER/NE membrane in cells at 20 min after NEBD shows that ZM447439 treatment decreased the distance in GFP-LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> cells (0.8 Î¼m), and the effect was less dramatic with GFP-LBR<sup>AA</sup> (0.92 Î¼m) compared with wild type (1.3 Î¼m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>).

The process of NE assembly has been best studied using the in vitro reconstitution system derived from frog egg extracts. However, the question of how NE assembly is coordinated with other mitotic events cannot be easily addressed in the in vitro system. In this study, we used live imaging of HeLa cells to investigate the role of mitotic regulators Cdk1, PP1/2A, and Aurora B that control multiple aspects of mitosis. By delivering their inhibitors to cells at specific mitotic stages, we demonstrated that these regulators are important for the disassembly and reformation of the NE during mitosis and that phosphorylation of inner nuclear membrane protein LBR contributes to the temporal control of NE assembly.</p><sec><title>Cdk1 prevents premature ER attachment to the chromatin</title><p>NE reassembly must be coordinated with sister chromatid segregation to ensure genome stability. Our time-lapse imaging shows that Cdk1 activity prevents premature ER attachment in early anaphase and that PP1/2A is required for NE reassembly. These results suggest that the balance between the activities of Cdk1 and PP1/2A determines the timing of NE reassembly. It was shown that PP1 is involved in the dephosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates after anaphase and that inactivation of Cdk1 at the end of mitosis induces PP1 activity through a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Thus PP1 may be responsible for initiating NE assembly at the end of mitosis. Because the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A used in our study is effective toward both PP1 and PP2A, we cannot rule out the possibility that PP2A may also be involved in this process. So far, it is unclear whether NE reassembly is a consequence of mitotic exit or Cdk1 inactivation is directly involved in NE reassembly. Our result of premature ER attachment upon inhibition of Cdk1 suggests a direct role for Cdk1 in the temporal control of NE assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of LBR by Cdk1 inhibits ER attachment</title><p>Overexpression of integral NE membrane proteins is known to expedite NE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of wild-type LBR slightly accelerates ER attachment compared with that of Sec61Î² overexpression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Overexpression of Cdk1 phosphorylation-site mutant LBR<sup>AA</sup> further advances ER attachment, indicating that Cdk1 phosphorylation negatively regulates the chromatin-binding ability of LBR. This notion is supported by the in vitro chromatin-binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Takano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (2010</xref>) recently proposed that phosphorylation of Ser71 is important for LBR to associate with importin Î², which targets LBR to Ran-GTP on chromatin, implying a positive role of Ser71 phosphorylation in NE assembly. Their finding contradicts with our results and those of Takano <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>). It is worth noting that LBR is capable of chromatin binding on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Ulbert <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Thus the recruitment of LBR-containing membrane to chromatin may not require importin Î² in vivo. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (2010</xref>) also showed that LBR<sup>S71A</sup> is not incorporated into the NE and perturbs NE assembly in cells. However, we found that LBR<sup>AA</sup> assembles into the NE and even advances NE formation during anaphase. One explanation for the discrepancy is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (2010</xref>) expressed <italic>Xenopus</italic> LBR in human cells in their studies. The nucleoplasmic domains of human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> LBR share only 36% identity, raising the possibility that <italic>Xenopus</italic> LBR may not behave normally in human cells.</p><p>Analysis of the nucleoplasmic domain of LBR shows that LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> markedly advances ER attachment, indicating that globular II domain normally inhibits the chromatin-binding activity of LBR. The ER attachment time of LBR<sup>ÎGII-AA</sup> is only slightly earlier than LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup>, suggesting that phosphorylation may inhibit chromatin binding of LBR through the globular II domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The average time of initial ER attachment for LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> (2.1 min in anaphase) is earlier than that of LBR<sup>AA</sup> (4.3 min; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that additional modification or mechanism is required to completely remove the inhibitory effect of the globular II domain. The Cdk1 phosphorylation might help to keep LBR in a conformation that masks the chromatin-binding site in the nucleoplasmic region. In late anaphase, LBR is then dephosphorylated to expose the chromatin-binding site. The process of Cdk1 inactivation through cyclin B degradation and the subsequent PP1 activation may provide enough time lag between anaphase onset and LBR dephosphorylation so that the NE does not reform until late anaphase.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9:</label><caption><p>A model for the dissociation and reassembly of NE during mitosis. The schematic representation shows the status of LBR and the chromatin during NEBD (left) and in late anaphase (right). During NEBD Cdk1 phosphorylates LBR and inhibits its chromatin-binding ability through the globular II domain. Aurora B residing on the chromosomes also promotes nuclear membrane dissociation by unknown mechanisms. In late anaphase, the increased PP1/2A activity dephosphorylates LBR and Aurora B substrates, which allows LBR and other inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins to associate with the chromatin. The inhibitory effect of Aurora B is lost because of its absence on anaphase chromosomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3306fig9"/></fig><p>LBR<sup>ÎGI-AA</sup> does not cause premature ER attachment, indicating that the globular I domain is important for chromatin binding. Indeed, deletion of the globular I domain (LBR<sup>61-208</sup>) impairs the chromatin-binding ability in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). However, previous study showed that residues 53â89 bind chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Takano <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). It is possible that chromatin binding of this region is inhibited by the globular II domain in LBR<sup>61-208</sup>. Although the globular I domain is important for chromatin binding, expression of LBR<sup>ÎGI</sup> does not block ER attachment. It is possible that other integral NE membrane proteins can still mediate ER recruitment, as NE formation in vivo involves multiple redundant interactions between several inner nuclear membrane proteins and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Aurora B is not involved in temporal control</title><p>Previous study using the in vitro nuclear assembly system of <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts showed that Aurora B kinase activity inhibits NE formation and that removal of Aurora B from the chromatin is required for chromosome decondensation and NE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Ramadan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). We find that inhibition of Aurora B in early anaphase has no apparent effect on the timing of initial ER attachment to the chromatin, indicating that Aurora B is not important for the temporal control of NE reformation. On the other hand, it is possible that Aurora B substrates remain phosphorylated after blocking Aurora B activity in early anaphase, which may contribute to the inhibition of NE assembly. Aurora B resides on chromosomes in early mitosis and translocates to centromeres at metaphase and to the spindle midzone after anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Ruchaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Thus the maintenance of histone H3 phosphorylation and chromosome condensation does not require continuous presence of Aurora B on the chromosome. Despite the phosphorylation, overexpression of LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> mutant causes premature ER attachment in early anaphase, indicating that the inhibitory effect, if any, of the Aurora B substrates can be overcome by the LBR mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Aurora B and LBR phosphorylation contribute to NE disassembly</title><p>Inhibition of Aurora B at prophase in cells expressing LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> or LBR<sup>AA</sup> delays the complete dissociation of NE membrane from the chromatin after NEBD, whereas inhibition of Aurora B or expression of LBR<sup>ÎGII</sup> alone affects this process to a lesser degree. These results are consistent with the notion that association of NE membrane with the chromatin involves multiple interactions. Aurora B residing on the prophase chromatin may phosphorylate chromatin proteins, which disrupts its interaction with some unknown inner nuclear membrane proteins, whereas phosphorylation of LBR by Cdk1 also reduces its chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Sustaining both interactions causes retention of residual NE on the chromatin after NE ruptures. Thus NEBD involves initial NE rupture mediated by microtubules, depolymerization of nuclear lamina through phosphorylation of lamin, and loss of membraneâchromatin interaction through phosphorylation by Cdk1 and Aurora B. Taken together, our data show that the control of chromatin-binding ability of LBR, partly through Cdk1 phosphorylation, is important for both NEBD and NE reassembly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Full-length Sec61Î² sequence was amplified from HeLa cDNA library (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by PCR using primers 5â²ACGAATTCTATGCCTGGTCCGACCCC3â² and 5â²CCGGTACCCTACGAACGAGTGTACTTGC3â².

The distance between chromatin surface and NE/ER membrane was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Muhlhausser and Kutay, 2007</xref>) for the central four sections of the Z-stack. Briefly, a radial grid of 20 lines with an angle of 18Â° between lines was placed in the center of the chromatin mass, and the distance between chromatin and membrane was manually measured along the grid lines by AxioVision, release 4.8, software.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>The expression constructs of pGEX-2T-LBR were transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21-DE3 RIL. The bacteria were cultured in 1 l of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium to 0.6 OD<sub>600</sub> before inducing the protein expression with 0.1 mM isopropyl Î²-<sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2.5 h. The cells were then lysed by sonication in lysis buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing 50 mM EDTA, 10 Î¼g/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]), followed by the addition of 1% Triton X-100. The GST-fusion proteins were purified through 1 ml of glutathione agarose and eluted with 10 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The purified proteins were concentrated by dialysis in PBS containing 50% glycerol.</p><p>For 6His-LBR-mCherry, the plasmids were transformed into BL21 strain. The protein expression was induced in 1 l of culture with 0.2 mM IPTG at 25Â°C for 4 h. The cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 Î¼g/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, and 1 mM PMSF), followed by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100. The proteins were purified through 1.5 ml of Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After washing with wash buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 25 mM imidazole, the proteins were eluted with 0.3 M imidazole in wash buffer. The purified proteins were concentrated by dialysis in PBS containing 50% glycerol.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro phosphorylation of LBR</title><p>The purified recombinant GST-LBR<sup>1-208</sup> proteins and GST were used as the substrates for Cdk1. The assay was performed in the kinase buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol) supplemented with 50 Î¼M ATP, 1 ng/Î¼l Cdk1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), 0.2 Î¼g/Î¼l substrate, and 1 Î¼Ci [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP at 30Â°C for 20 min. The reaction was resolved by 10% SDSâPAGE. The gel was stained by Coomassie blue (Sigma-Aldrich) and dried for autoradiography. The <sup>32</sup>P incorporation was quantified by Typhoon FLA 9000 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) with ImageQuant TL 7.0 software (GE Healthcare), and protein levels were determined with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin-binding assay</title><p>The extracts from <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Murray, 1991</xref>) with the following modifications. For interphase cytosol, dejellied eggs were activated with 10 Î¼M calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.2 Ã MMR (0.2 M NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 7.8). Eggs were then washed several times with 0.2 Ã MMR and then with extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 Î¼g/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin,). Packed eggs were centrifuged at 12,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 15 min in an SW55Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) at 2Â°C. The crude cytoplasmic fraction from the centrifugation was then centrifuged at 200,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 90 min in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) to separate the cytosol from the membrane fractions. The cytosol was then centrifuged again at 200,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 30 min to remove residual membrane. The resulting high-speed supernatant (HSS) was then used for the chromatin-binding assay or for phosphorylating LBR proteins. The in vitro chromatin-binding assay was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Takano <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Briefly, HSS was first heated at 95Â°C for 10 min, cooled on ice for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 20,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to remove denatured proteins. The heated cytosol containing nucleoplasmin was then used to decondense demembranated frog sperm nuclei that were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Murray, 1991</xref>). For each chromatin-binding reaction, 40 Î¼l of heated cytosol were incubated with sperm nuclei at a density of â¼15,000 per Î¼l of cytosol for 30 min at 25Â°C, followed by incubation with 0.5 Î¼g of 6His-LBR-mCherry proteins for 30 min on ice. The samples were then diluted with nine volumes (360 Î¼l) of ice-cold extraction buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and layered over 1 ml of 30% sucrose made in extraction buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 15 min in a JS13.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Chromosomal pellets were washed in 500 Î¼l of the sucrose solution and spun again for 5 min. The pellets were solubilized by heating at 95Â°C for 5 min in SDSâPAGE sample buffer for immunoblot analysis with anti-mCherry antibody (provided by Chao-Wen Wang, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan).</p><p>For prior treatment with cytosol, 6His-LBR-mCherry proteins were first bound to Ni-NTA beads and then incubated with mitotic or interphase HSS for 75 min at 25Â°C. The beads were then washed four times with wash buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and the proteins were eluted with 0.3 M imidazole in wash buffer.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinase assays</title><p>HeLa cells were synchronized at mitosis with 100 ng/ml of nocodazole for 16 h. Mitotic cells were harvested by physical shake-off, replated, and treated with DMSO, roscovitine (200 Î¼M), or ZM447439 (20 Î¼M) for 20 min in a 37Â°C humidified incubator. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH, 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 50 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 Î¼g/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin). A total of 300 Î¼g of lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdc2 antibody (sc-54; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), antiâAIM-1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and anti-Plk antibody (N-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), with 20 Î¼l of protein GâSepharose (GE Healthcare), for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer. The kinase assay was performed in 10-Î¼l reaction in kinase buffer containing 50 Î¼M ATP, 1 Î¼Ci [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, and substrates (2 Î¼g of histone H1, 2 Î¼g of histone H3, and 0.6 Î¼g of casein for the kinase assay of Cdk1, Aurora B, and Plk1, respectively) at 30Â°C for 20 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP or GFP-LBR variants along with H2B-mCherry as described for live imaging. The cells were harvested 2 d after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer. The Western blots were probed with anti-LBR rabbit monoclonal antibody (E398L) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), antiâÎ±-tubulin antibody (Upstate, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and anti-GFP antibody (provided by Chao-Wen Wang, Academia Sinica).</p></sec></sec>
