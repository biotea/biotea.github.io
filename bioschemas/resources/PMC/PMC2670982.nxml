We now identified a somatic 2<sup>nd</sup> hit causing loss-of-function of the receptor in a resected VMCM. We assessed for whether such localized, tissue-specific events play a role in the etiology of the far more common sporadic VM. Eight somatic <italic>TIE2</italic> mutations were identified in lesions from 28 out of 57 patients (49.1%), not detected in their blood or in control tissues.

When overexpressed in HUVECs, L914F showed abnormal localization and response to ligand, differing from wild-type and the common inherited R849W mutant, suggesting they may have distinct effects. The presence of the same mutations in multifocal VMs in two patients, suggests a common origin for the abnormal endothelial cells in the distant sites. In conclusion, these data illustrate that a sporadic disease may be explained by somatic changes in a gene causing rare, inherited forms, and pinpoint TIE2 pathways as potential therapeutic targets for VM.</p>

    <p id="P6">The vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) TIE2 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and cardiovascular development <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Its ligands, the angiopoietins (Ang), induce receptor dimerization and phosphorylation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, with Ang-1 acting as an agonist and Ang-2 as context-dependent antagonist or weak agonist <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. In man, heterozygous <italic>TIE2</italic> substitutions that induce <italic>in vitro</italic> ligand-independent hyperphosphorylation cause hereditary mucocutaneous venous malformations (VMCM) <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, characterized by multifocal small bluish cutaneous and mucosal lesions, composed of enlarged, tortuous venous channels. The most common is a c.2545c&gt;t change (R849W), which occurs in a total of 10/17 families reported <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The remaining changes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) have each been identified in a single family <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. We previously postulated a paradominant mode of inheritance to account for the heterogeneous, focal lesions of VMCM <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Here, we identified a somatic, lesion-associated <italic>TIE2</italic> â2<sup>nd</sup>-hitâ alteration in one resected VMCM, from a patient (Sa-I.4, in <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) carrying the germline R849W. A cDNA screen revealed an in-frame deletion of 129-bp, corresponding to a loss of exon 3 and part of exon 4 (amino acids 122-165 of the extracellular <italic>Ig2</italic> ligand-binding domain; âDelâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Allele-specific PCR showed that the loss, which is part of an intragenic somatic DNA deletion (see <bold>Methods</bold>), occurs on the wild-type, and not the inherited R849W-mutant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Unlike inherited intracellular TIE2 mutations, the somatic deletion mutant (âDelâ) was not hyperphophorylated <italic>in vitro</italic>, nor did it exacerbate hyperphosphorylation of R849W in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The lack of 43 amino acids resulted in loss of cell surface expression of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), as well as its inability to bind Ang1, in contrast to WT and R849W (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b, c</xref>). In retrovirally transfected HUVECs, Del-TIE2 is retained in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and shows no ability to respond to Ang1 by increased phosphorylation or translocation and clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). It is probable that Del-TIE2 fails to fold into its native form, causing defective protein trafficking and ER-retention <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Thus, the somatic deletion mutant acts as a null-allele, causing local loss-of-function of wild-type TIE2.</p>
    <p id="P8">The identification of a 2<sup>nd</sup> hit in VMCM tissue, led to the hypothesis that somatic changes in <italic>TIE2</italic> could also be etiopathogenic for common sporadic VM. We screened blood-DNA from 57 affected individuals, most of whom had extensive, unifocal lesions, typical of sporadic VM<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Histologically, they were characterized by enlarged venous channels with patchy smooth-muscle cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and thin, continuous TIE2-positive EC layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-e</xref>). No <italic>TIE2</italic> mutations were detected in blood-DNA. To test for somatic changes, we screened DNAs from 62 VMs from the same 57 patients, and identified 8 missense substitutions in exon 17, in 30 lesions from 28 patients (49.1%; described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In 24/30 mutation-positive lesions (from 24/28 patients; i.e. 85.7%), a change at codon 914 (CTT to TTT; L914F) was identified, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In 6 VMs (including 2 lesions each from 2 patients with multifocal VMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f, g</xref>), we detected two mutations in <italic>cis</italic>, i.e. on the same allele (see <bold>Methods</bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b-e, Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Each consisted of a Y897 mutation in combination with another change: [Y897H+R915C], [Y897F+R915L], [Y897C+R915C], and [Y897S+S917I] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f, g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The necessity for two mutations (897 in the 1<sup>st</sup> tyrosine kinase [TK] domain, in combination with a residue from the âkinase insert domain [KID]-clusterâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) on the same allele to confer pathogenicity is uncommon, but was described for lung cancer-associated TK domain epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The 4 patients with double mutations exhibited no clinical differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), except the occurrence of multiple lesions in 2/4 individuals. Each had a double-mutation in common between two lesions assessed, independent of location, suggesting a common cellular (rather than individual and localized) origin for the multifocal VMs; however, they were not detectable in blood-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f, g</xref>). They could be attributed to common EC-progenitor cells circulating to these distinct sites. Late-developing lesions could have their origins in a stem cell niche, where some cells with the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation carry post-zygotic mutations <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, or alternatively, circulating ECs sloughed off from a primary lesion. Resections, however, do not seem to have increased development of additional lesions.</p>
    <p id="P9">No exon 17 change was found in 90 control tissues from unrelated individuals, including resected skin, hemangiomas, lymphatic and vascular malformations (<italic>p= 9.006e<sup>â15</sup></italic>; two-tailed Fisher's Exact test), demonstrating that the <italic>TIE2</italic> substitutions are not common, non-associated, somatic changes.</p>
    <p id="P10">We assessed for expression of <italic>TIE2</italic> mutants in cDNA from 26/30 mutation-positive tissues. Both wild-type and mutant alleles were detected. To estimate their relative levels, we performed semi-quantitative minisequencing (SNaPshot, Applied Biosystems) on a large subset of DNAs and cDNAs (11 with L914F, i.e. 46%; at least 1 lesion each of the double-mutants; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; sample chromatograms: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, raw data: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The presence of the mutant, relative to wild-type, was consistently enhanced in cDNA as compared to DNA (1.8-18 fold; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1, 2</xref>). In addition, mutant alleles were not detectable by this method in 2 DNAs, but robustly expressed in cDNAs. The most frequent sporadic VM mutation (L914F), which is the only change that occurs alone, has not been identified in the germline in VMCM, suggesting it is strongly deleterious. It may nevertheless require an additional hit for lesion formation: in &gt;60% (7/11) of tissues assessed, the relative level of expressed L914F was over 50% (58-92%) of the total, arguing for overexpression of the mutant, or loss of the wild-type by an unknown mechanism. The double-mutants were also enriched in cDNA, to a lower level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We compared the relative abundance of pairs of <italic>cis</italic>-mutations in tissues in order to impute their order of occurrence (see <bold>Methods</bold>), which would appear to be fairly even, with Y897 mutations appearing first in lesions from two patients, and the other <italic>cis</italic> mutations (R915C or R915L) occurring first in two others with multifocal lesions. The difference between mutations constituting each pair was small (within 10% of each other; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), accounting for the predominance of double-mutants obtained by cloning.</p>
    <p id="P11">The somatic substitution sites, located within the first TK (Y897, L914, R915) or KID (S917) of TIE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>) <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, are highly conserved between RTKs across species, and bioinformatic analyses predicted weak-to-strongly damaging effects on protein function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We found L914F induced higher ligand-independent receptor phosphorylation than the common germline R849W (12.7Â±5.8 <italic>vs.</italic> 4.2Â±1.6 -fold over wild-type, meanÂ±SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Double-mutations had stronger (roughly additive) effects than constituent single mutations, with each Y897 substitution being weaker of the pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). There was no correlation between clinical phenotype and level of hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">To compare the effects of WT, and the most frequent inherited (R849W) and somatic (L914F) mutants, their sub-cellular localization and activation was studied with and without activating Ang1-ligand (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In the absence of ligand, WT and R849W-TIE2 were distributed evenly on cell-membranes, with occasional and slight increase in perinuclear TIE2 immunoreactivity, and no phosphorylated TIE2 (P-TIE2)-specific staining observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). In contrast, L914F showed strong perinuclear accumulation, and ligand-independent activation in a distinct compartment near the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We and others have shown that Ang1-binding induces TIE2 clustering and translocation to cell edges<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. This was observed in the majority of cells expressing WT and R849W (85.8Â±3.6% and 84.8Â±7.6% respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d, e</xref>), but only in a subset of L914F-HUVECs (12.5Â±4.1%), in which the protein was largely found in a punctuate pattern dispersed over the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). In mobile cells, Ang1-activated TIE2 accumulates in the trailing edge and retraction fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). R849W was more activated in retraction fibers than WT in response to Ang1, with L914F showing the presence of fibers similar to those observed with R849W, with intermediate P-TIE2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-f</xref>). Within fibers, WT was typically phosphorylated in the distal ends and TIE2-containing nodules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), whereas R849W showed higher P-TIE2 intensity all along (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b, d</xref>). L914F also showed P-TIE2 immunoreactivity along the fibers, at levels significantly higher than WT, but lower than R849W (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c, d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P13">To investigate its perinuclear compartmentalization in greater detail, L914F-overexpressing HUVECs were stained with Golgi and ER markers. No P-TIE2 staining was observed in Golgi of WT-transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), or the majority of R849W expressing cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>; weak perinuclear P-TIE2 staining detected in a few cells: 3.2Â±2% meanÂ±SD, not shown<bold>)</bold>. In contrast, L914F activation was seen in the Golgi in the majority of cells (73.2Â±7% cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). L914F was also retained in ER in both unstimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>) and Ang1-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Unlike Del-TIE2 however, L914F was not exclusively intracellular, since Ang1 did induce (albeit incomplete) L914F clustering and translocation to cell-cell junctions, cell edges, and retraction fibers, where its activation status was above that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c, d</xref>). ER-retention of L914F may be phosphorylation-dependent (in contrast to the less strongly phosphorylated R849W), as in the case of human disease-associated mutations in other RTKs, including KIT, FLT-3 and FGFR3<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Thus, the common inherited and sporadic mutations both profoundly affect TIE2 compartmentalization and activation, as well as response to ligand, and may act in overlapping yet distinct ways to potentiate VM -pathogenesis.</p>
    <p id="P14">In summary, we demonstrate, for the first time, that somatic mutations in <italic>TIE2</italic> cause common, sporadic VM, allowing us to generalize findings on a rare, inherited form of a vascular anomaly, to its far more frequent, sporadic counterpart. This may be true for other disorders, and suggests that somatic screens should be performed at least for the numerous non-inherited vascular anomalies of unknown etiology. Finally, the implication of TIE2 in sporadic VMs greatly broadens the potential utility of therapeutic treatments that inhibit angiogenesis in general, and the TIE2 signaling pathway in particular.</p>

        <title>Patient Recruitment</title>
        <p id="P15">Fifty-seven patients were recruited in collaboration with the Vascular Anomalies Center, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrolment in the study, as approved by the ethical committee of the Medical Faculty at the UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.

        <title>Mutational Analysis of a VMCM (Sa-I.4) Tissue</title>
        <p id="P17">Tissue and lymphoblast RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized as above. Five overlapping amplicons of â¼1 kb covering the entire <italic>TIE2</italic> coding sequence (3.5 kb) were amplified and sized on agarose gels. PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels. In order to determine if the somatic deletion and R849W germline mutation were allelic, allele-specific PCR was performed with Reverse primers specific for the wild-type or mutant at the R849W change, located in exon 15, and a common Forward primer located in exon 2. The non-deleted product is of 2276 bp, whereas the allele containing the deletion is of 2147 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Conditions for the c.2545C&gt;T (R849W) allele-specific PCR have been described previously <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Upon sequencing an amplicon spanning exons 3 and 4 in both blood and tissue DNA, we observed loss-of-heterozygosity in the tissue for a novel SNP (t/c in blood &gt; t in tissue) in <italic>TIE2</italic> intron 3 at position 27159180 bp on chromosome 9, indicating that the identified loss in the ligand-binding domain is part of an intragenic somatic DNA deletion, rather than the result of aberrant splicing due to a single nucleotide change.</p>

        <p id="P21">The 23 coding-exons of the <italic>TIE2</italic> gene, including exon-intron boundaries, were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA. The amplicons were screened by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) on the WAVE 3500 HS system (Transgenomic Inc.). For each sample showing an abnormal elution profile, PCR-amplification of that exon was repeated, followed by sequencing on a CEQ2000 fluorescent capillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter) in order to identify the nucleotide change(s). These were confirmed by allele-specific PCR, or by enzymatic digestion on a separately amplified PCR-product (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). To assess for mutations in exon 17 of the <italic>TIE2</italic> in tissue cDNA, direct sequencing of PCR products was carried out for each patient with a <italic>TIE2</italic> mutation, using primers located in exons 15 and 18. Where double-mutations occurred, allele-specific PCR using a common forward and specific reverse primer for the more distal mutant residue (915 or 917) was performed on DNA.

        <title>Semi-quantitative estimation of prevalence of mutant-alleles in DNA and RNA</title>
        <p id="P22">For a large subset of VMs, the SNaPshot minisequencing assay (Applied Biosystems) was performed, according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, PCR-amplification of exon 17 was carried out, in duplicate (with <italic>Pfu</italic>-proofreading, and <italic>Taq</italic> polymerases) from both tissue DNA and cDNA. Amplicons were cleaned by <italic>SAP</italic> and <italic>ExoI</italic> treatment. A Forward or Reverse primer stopping just short of the mutation-site was used in a single-base extension reaction with fluorescently labelled ddNTPs, performed on cleaned amplicons (primer sequences: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These were <italic>SAP</italic>-treated and run on an ABI3130<italic>xl</italic> Genetic Analyzer. The peak colors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), and the ratio of allele peak-heights obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), reflect the composition of the template amplicon, allowing for an estimation of the <italic>relative</italic> abundance of mutant to wild-type alleles. The absolute peak-heights reflect amplicon-abundance, which do not alter allele ratios. Full-length wild-type or mutant <italic>TIE2</italic> plasmid constructs were used as controls; 50:50 mixtures of these provided the heterozygote allele peak-height ratio, to which ratios obtained from tissues were normalized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The relative levels of pairs of <italic>cis</italic>-mutations in tissues were compared to each other. Increased presence of one mutation as compared to the other, could be imputed to reflect its precedence: the occurrence of the first in a set of cells is followed by the appearance of the second in a subset of them. SNaPshot data was corroborated by large-scale cloning-and-sequencing of DNA from lesion #28b. We obtained 5 clones with [Y897C+R915C], 6 with R915C alone, and 0 with Y897C alone, out of 80 total. This trend correlates with SNaPshot data (5% for Y897C vs. 11% for R915C), so that by these criteria, R915C may have occurred first.</p>

Intracellular region contains 2 tyrosine kinase domains (TK) separated by kinase insert domain (KID). Locations of missense substitutions previously identified in inherited VMCM are shown. A somatic mutation (âDelâ) deletes part of <italic>Ig2</italic> in the (wild-type) allele of one VMCM patient (Sa-I.4), carrying the inherited R849W mutation. <bold>(b)</bold> PCR [exons 1-7] in patient Sa-I.4 shows a 900-bp band (expected: 1029 bp) absent in control (left panel). Sequencing demonstrates a 129-bp deletion, of exon 3 and 14-bp of exon 4 (middle) in 900-bp band. Allele-specific PCR shows deletion on wild-type allele (WT), which runs smaller than expected (by 129 bp); mutant R849W runs at expected size (right panel). <bold>(c)</bold> Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to evaluate TIE2 phosphorylation (pTyr, 140 kD, top). Blots stripped and reprobed with anti-TIE2 for total TIE2 levels (bottom). Lysates from Cos-7 cells expressing WT, R849W, or Del (left panel), or various ratios of R849W: Del (right panel). EV: Empty vector control. 43-amino-acid size difference observed in Del, as compared to WT and R849W (arrows). <bold>(d)</bold> Flow-cytometry on TIE2 (WT, Del, or R849W) -transfected Cos7 cells, or EV controls.
