      <abstract>
        <p>Telomeres are repetitive DNA structures that, together with the shelterin and the CST complex, protect the ends of chromosomes. Telomere shortening is mitigated in stem and cancer cells through the <italic>de novo</italic> addition of telomeric repeats by telomerase. Telomere elongation requires the delivery of the telomerase complex to telomeres through a not yet fully understood mechanism. Factors promoting telomeraseâtelomere interaction are expected to directly bind telomeres and physically interact with the telomerase complex. In search for such a factor we carried out a SILAC-based DNAâprotein interaction screen and identified HMBOX1, hereafter referred to as homeobox telomere-binding protein 1 (HOT1). HOT1 directly and specifically binds double-stranded telomere repeats, with the <italic>in vivo</italic> association correlating with binding to actively processed telomeres. Depletion and overexpression experiments classify HOT1 as a positive regulator of telomere length. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and cell fractionation analyses show that HOT1 associates with the active telomerase complex and promotes chromatin association of telomerase. Collectively, these findings suggest that HOT1 supports telomerase-dependent telomere elongation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures at the ends of chromosomes, consist of 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats bound by a dedicated set of proteins forming the shelterin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). Three members of the six protein complex directly bind telomeric DNA and were the only direct telomere-specific binding proteins known so far: TRF1 and TRF2 bind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Zhong et al, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Bilaud et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Broccoli et al, 1997</xref>), whereas POT1 binds single-stranded 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Baumann, 2001</xref>). This complex constitutively associates with telomeres and shields the ends of linear chromosomes from being recognized as a double-stranded break, thus protecting telomeres from end-to-end fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). While this solves the end-protection problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">de Lange, 2009</xref>), maintaining telomere integrity itself is of outstanding importance and major factors may have remained elusive.</p>
      <p>Telomere length homeostasis, a crucial process in stem cell biology, aging and cancer, depends on the equilibrium between telomere lengthening (in most cases due to telomerase activity) and shortening reactions (generally due to replication and controlled processing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Jain and Cooper, 2010</xref>). Telomerase is capable of adding telomeric repeats to chromosome ends <italic>de novo.</italic> The enzyme works as a ribonucleoprotein complex, which consists of a catalytic subunit with reverse-transcriptase activity (called TERT), and an RNA serving as the elongation matrix for telomeres (called TR or TERC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Greider and Blackburn, 1989</xref>). While these two core elements are sufficient for telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, biochemical analyses have shown that <italic>in vivo</italic> telomerase resides in a large complex of about 1 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Schnapp et al, 1998</xref>). Some additional components of this large multi-subunit holoenzyme complex have been identified. In particular, the core components of box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs), DKC1 (dyskerin), GAR1, NHP2 and NOP10, are part of the active telomerase complex, and are necessary for proper RNP assembly as well as for TERC stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Mitchell et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Wang and Meier, 2004</xref>). More recently, the ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 have been identified as factors essential for holoenzyme assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Venteicher et al, 2008</xref>), and TCAB1 (WDR79/WRAP53), identified as a DKC1 interaction partner, was shown to be required for proper localization of CAB box containing small Cajal body (CB)-specific RNPs (scaRNPs) to CBs, including TERC, and is part of the active telomerase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Tycowski et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Venteicher et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The presence of major scaRNA processing and trafficking factors in the telomerase complex hints to an important aspect of telomerase cell biology: the orchestrated maturation of telomerase and interaction with telomeres in the CB. Telomere maintenance by telomerase requires that both TERT and TERC are recruited from distinct subnuclear sites to telomeres during S phase (synthesis phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Tomlinson et al, 2008</xref>). Like other scaRNAs, TERC contains a common CB-specific localization signal and accumulates in CBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">JÃ¡dy et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Zhu et al, 2004</xref>), where it is found together with TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Tomlinson et al, 2008</xref>). In a cell cycle-dependent manner, telomerase-containing CBs are then recruited to telomeres, suggesting that CBs represent an enzymatic hub in which telomere elongation by telomerase takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">JÃ¡dy et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Tomlinson et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Cristofari et al, 2007</xref>). This trafficking model is further supported by telomere elongation defects in the absence of TCAB1 or presence of dysfunctional TCAB1, disrupting TERC accumulation in the CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Venteicher et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Zhong et al, 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, so far it remains elusive how telomeres are recruited to CBs, how this selective interaction is regulated and what drives the conversion from telomeres in a closed state, in which telomerase has little or no access, to telomeres in an open, accessible state.</p>
      <p>Telomerase is usually limiting and, under physiological conditions, acts preferentially on short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Hemann et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Britt-Compton et al, 2009</xref>), due to a well-established negative feedback loop mediated in <italic>cis</italic> by TRF1 and POT1, likely by hiding the 3â²-overhang, which serves as a template for telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Loayza and de Lange, 2003</xref>). Indeed, diminished loading of POT1 or expression of a dominant-negative version lacking DNA-binding activity leads to telomere elongation by telomerase, and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown that POT1 is competing with telomerase for its substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Loayza and de Lange, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Ye et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Kelleher et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Lei et al, 2005</xref>). However, POT1 also interacts with TPP1, and both proteins together promote telomerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Latrick and Cech, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, TPP1 has been shown to be required for the recruitment of telomerase to its substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> and to telomeric chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Xin et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abreu et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Tejera et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Zaug et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Zhong et al, 2012</xref>). While TPP1 has been proposed as a telomerase recruiter, it does not completely fit the definition, since it has initially been described as a negative regulator of telomere length in telomerase-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Liu et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Ye et al, 2004</xref>), although these results may in part be attributed to secondary effects, such as the lack of POT1 tethering to telomeres in the absence of TPP1. Based on these bivalent results, a ying-yang model for telomerase recruitment and activity control has been proposed for TPP1âPOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Xin et al, 2007</xref>). Indeed, recently, a specific patch of amino acids on the surface of TPP1, the TEL patch (TPP1 glutamate (E)- and leucine (L)-rich patch), has been identified as crucial for the TPP1 function in telomerase recruitment and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Nandakumar et al, 2012</xref>). Analysis of point mutations within the TEL patch demonstrated that the TEL patch is physically and functionally distant from the portion of TPP1 engaged in end protection, separating these two functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Nandakumar et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Regulating the amount of telomeric repeats added by telomerase also involves how long telomerase can act on a given chromosome end. Therefore, turning off telomerase needs to be regulated in addition to the recruitment step and processivity control. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen et al (2012)</xref> described the human CST (CTC1, STN1 and TEN1) complex as a terminator of telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen et al, 2012</xref>). CST competes with POT1âTPP1 for telomeric DNA and is increasingly enriched on telomeric DNA during late S/G2 phase, correlating with the period in the cell cycle when telomerase action is terminated. In agreement with a suppression of telomerase action, depletion of any of the three CST complex members led to a steady increase in telomere length in a telomerase-dependent manner. The authors suggested that CST binds to telomerase-extended 3â²-ends and thereby suppresses telomerase access and further elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen et al, 2012</xref>). However, depletion of STN1 has been reported not to affect telomere length in various telomerase-positive cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Wang et al, 2012</xref>) and murine CTC1-null cells do not exhibit the reported telomere lengthening phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Gu et al, 2012</xref>). The proposed model is nonetheless appealing, as human CST subunits stimulate DNA polymerase Î±-primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Casteel et al, 2009</xref>) and therefore CST binding to telomerase-extended 3â²-ends could initiate a switch from telomere elongation to fill-in synthesis. This mechanism could provide an autonomous end point to telomerase action at single telomeres, ensuring that every telomere is extended by telomerase once and only once during every cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>We reasoned that the identification of novel telomere-binding proteins would be a first step to the identification of additional factors implicated in telomere biology. SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) has been adapted for DNAâprotein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Mittler et al, 2009</xref>) and has been used by us and others successfully to identify factors binding to particular functional DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Markljung et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Butter et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bartels et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Butter et al, 2012</xref>). For our purpose, we applied this approach to telomeric DNA in order to screen for telomere repeat-binding proteins and identified the protein HOT1 (HMBOX1; homeobox telomere-binding protein 1). HOT1 had previously been described as a putative transcriptional repressor based on reporter gene assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Chen et al, 2006</xref>) and had been identified as a telomere-associated protein by the proteomics of isolated chromatin segments (PICh) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">DÃ©jardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>). Here we demonstrate that HOT1 directly binds to telomeric DNA, and characterize this binding in atomic detail by resolving a crystal structure of the HOT1 homeobox domain in a cocrystal with telomeric DNA. <italic>In viv</italic>o, HOT1 localizes to a subset of telomeres with a higher degree of HOT1âtelomere association in cellular contexts of elevated telomere processing. In addition, we show that HOT1 associates with the active telomerase complex and that HOT1 is required for telomerase chromatin binding. These findings suggest that HOT1 contributes to the association of telomerase with telomeres and telomere length maintenance in various cellular settings, and classify HOT1 as the first direct telomere-binding protein that acts as a positive regulator of telomere length.</p>

        <title>Identification of HOT1 as a direct telomere repeat-binding protein</title>
        <p>To identify telomere-binding proteins we used polymerized biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides of the telomeric sequence (5â²-TTAGGG-3â²) and a scrambled control sequence (5â²-GTGAGT-3â²), separately immobilized on paramagnetic streptavidin beads and incubated with heavy and light SILAC-labelled nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, respectively. Specific binding of proteins is detected by incubation of cell lysates encoded by âheavy' amino acids (<sup>15</sup>N- and <sup>13</sup>C-labelled Lys and Arg) with the bait sequence, while a control sequence is incubated with âlight', nonlabelled amino acids. Specific binders display a differential SILAC ratio, whereas background binders have a 1:1 ratio. After mild washing, bead fractions were combined and captured proteins were analysed by quantitative, high-resolution MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>We identified all the six core shelterin components with a SILAC ratio of about 10 or higher in the âforward' and about 0.1 in the âreverse' experiment, in which we had switched the labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In contrast, none of the proteins known to interact with shelterin were identified with SILAC ratios sufficiently high to be consistent with telomere binding, demonstrating that this approach was very stringent and exclusively detected telomere repeat-binding proteins and their strong interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to the shelterin components, we found the protein HOT1 with a high SILAC ratio that clustered with those of the shelterin components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This indicates that HOT1 must either strongly associate with the shelterin complex or directly bind to the 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats.</p>
        <p>To verify that the HOT1 identification was not cancer-, cell- or species-specific, we repeated our telomere-binding assay with SILAC-labelled nuclear extracts derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells). Again, all components of the shelterin complex and HOT1 were identified with SILAC ratios, indicating specific binding to the telomere repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Here we also identified the two paralogues, POT1a and POT1b, which result from a gene duplication of the <italic>Pot1</italic> gene in the rodent lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Hockemeyer et al, 2006</xref>), underscoring the specificity of our assay for direct telomere-binding proteins. Hence, HOT1 is a putative telomere repeat-binding protein conserved in mammalian cells.</p>
        <p>HOT1 contains a homeobox domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Chen et al, 2006</xref>), suggesting that it may bind DNA directly. To determine whether HOT1 was detected in our assay due to direct binding to the 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats, we performed DNA-binding assays with HOT1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Recombinant HOT1 bound specifically to telomeric repeats, whereas no binding to the negative control repeat fragments (5â²-GTGAGT-3â²) was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Exhibiting similar binding behaviour as TRF1, HOT1 was not enriched on any of the subtelomeric variant repeats 5â²-TCAGGG-3â², 5â²-TGAGGG-3â² and 5â²-TTGGGG-3â², nor on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> telomere 5â²-TTAGGC-3â² repeat sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Wicky et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test whether HOT1 also associates with telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments with extracts from HeLa cells using an antibody directed against HOT1. Similar to TRF2, HOT1 IPs showed enrichment of telomeric DNA in comparison to two negative controls (anti-GFP antibody and IgG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, HOT1 is a direct and specific telomere repeat-binding protein.</p>

        <title>HOT1 recognizes telomeric DNA by means of its homeodomain</title>
        <p>Driven by these findings and with the aim to fully understand the molecular interactions between HOT1 and telomeric DNA, we crystallized the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of HOT1 with telomeric DNA. In order to identify a construct suitable for crystallization, we initially tested six different HOT1 fragments for their DNA-binding ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The three longer constructs Q144âA345, L156âA345 and G233âA345 all bound to immobilized telomeric dsDNA baits, demonstrating that the homeodomain of HOT1 is sufficient for recognizing telomeric DNA and that integrity of the predicted N-terminal POU-specific (POUs) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Chi et al, 2002</xref>) is not required. The three shorter constructs (P242âA345, P254âA345 and R271âA345) were not able to bind to the bait DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). For crystallization, we reconstituted and purified telomeric DNA complexes with all three binding constructs, but only one (G233âA345) yielded crystals when reconstituted with a duplex telomeric DNA (5â²-cTGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAG-3â² and 3â²-ACAATCCCAATCCCAATCt-5â²) similar to the one present in the crystal structures of the TRF1 and TRF2 homeodomains bound to telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Court et al, 2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>The optimized crystals diffracted to 2.9 Ã resolution and we could solve the structure by molecular replacement using the NMR model of the human HOT1 homeodomain (residues 268â343, PDB entry 2CUF, unpublished data from RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative). In the orthorhombic crystals, the DNA forms an infinite double helix via a CâT nonWatsonâCrick base pairing of the single-base overhangs (not shown). Two copies of the HOT1 DBD are bound to one duplex DNA that comprises two and a half 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats in a regular and undistorted B-form conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). As expected, and in accordance with the NMR model, the homeodomain of HOT1 folds into a small structure of three consecutive helices, Î±1 (res. 276â288), Î±2 (res. 293â309) and Î±3 (res. 322â342), separated by a loop (Î±1âÎ±2) and a turn (Î±2âÎ±3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The N-terminal residues 233â266 and the two C-terminal residues were not defined by electron density and were, thus, not built.</p>
        <p>As reported for TRF1 and TRF2, each copy of the HOT1 homeodomain binds to the major groove of the DNA double helix around a 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Typical for homeobox domains, binding to DNA is mainly mediated by an N-terminal unstructured arm (267â276), the loop between Î±1 and Î±2, and the C-terminal Î±3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Binding and sequence recognition is achieved through a combination of either water-mediated or direct contacts with the phosphate backbone (on both sides of the major groove) and the DNA nucleobases in the major (Î±3) and minor groove (N-terminal arm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2C and D</xref>; the structure is deposited under PBD entry 4J19; for crystallographic statistics please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>).</p>

        <title>Lysine 335 is a key residue for telomere sequence specificity of HOT1</title>
        <p>In order to bind a specific sequence, the HOT1 homeodomain must recognize and directly contact individual bases of telomeric DNA. We could identify five such direct interactions (R271, Y327, N332, K335, R339; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2C, D and F</xref>) in our structure. Four of these residues reside on helix 3, which is generally referred to as the recognition helix and one, R271, is part of the unstructured N-terminal arm.</p>
        <p>In detail, Y327 binds to N6 of the adenine base of A6 via a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>). K338 and R339 are in close proximity and oriented towards the phosphate of G8 and the nucleobase of G7, respectively, but their electron density was not as clearly defined, probably due to conformational flexibility. However, in our mutant analysis the single mutants K338A and R339A no longer bind DNA, and Y327A shows weakened bindingâa clear indication that these residues are important for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, N332 makes two direct hydrogen bonds with the adenine base of A11â² of the complementary strand, but mutating N332 to A had no or little effect in our binding assay.</p>
        <p>The interaction of a lysine, K335, of this helix might be the most noteworthy. The É-amino group of K335 makes a bifurcated hydrogen bond with carbonyl oxygens of two adjacent guanine bases (G8 and G9) in the major groove. Mutation of this lysine to alanine (K335A) not only completely abrogates binding of HOT1 to the 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² motif, suggesting that this residue is essential for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2E and F</xref>), but this mutation also results in the âgained' ability to bind a nontelomeric control sequence (5â²-GTGAGT-3â²) in our pull-down experiments. To our understanding, this âgain-of-function' is a strong indication that K335 is a critical determinant for recognizing and binding to the telomeric sequence and, thus, for the specificity of HOT1.</p>
        <p>Cooperatively, residues in helix 3 recognize a 5â²-AGGGT-3â² (=Aâ²) motif in the telomeric DNA. Furthermore, residues K325, N328 and R334 of this helix bind to the ribose phosphate backbone either directly (K325 to A11â², and R334 to A6) or through water (N328 to A11â² and C12â²). Apart from helix 3, we observe sequence-specific interactions from residues in the Î±1âÎ±2 loop (Y291 binding to the phosphate O of G7) and the N-terminal arm. In full-length HOT1, this arm is predicted to be part of an unstructured stretch of â¼65 residues between the homeodomain and the preceding putative POUs domain. Notably, in the structures of TRF1 and TRF2 this arm was discussed to be important for extending the DNA-binding interface by adding specificity and affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Court et al, 2005</xref>). In our structure, the hydroxyl group of S270 of this arm binds to the G14 backbone phosphate, and R271 specifically contacts both base moieties of the A12âT9â² base pair, either directly (T9â²), or through a water molecule (A12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>). The importance of R271 was also confirmed by the fact that mutating this residue to alanine (R271A) completely abolishes DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). As outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>, the homeodomain of HOT1 docks onto telomeric DNA by specifically interacting with nucleobases and backbone groups of more than one telomeric repeat. In particular, R271 binds to the A12âT9â² base pair of the following repeat. This overlapping binding, which was also seen in the structures of TRF1 and TRF2, accounts for the repetitive nature of telomeric DNA and probably provides an extra level of selectivity.</p>
        <p>While TRF1 and TRF2 also recognize telomeric dsDNA via their respective homeobox domains, they only share low sequence similarity with the homeodomain of HOT1 (13 and 5%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>) and DNA binding is different in both cases. TRF1 and TRF2 both bind DNA via highly conserved interactions, involving direct interactions of Î±3 to TTxGG (direct contacts with phosphate (x) or bases), or xAGGGTx when water-mediated contacts are included. In HOT1, Î±3 of the homeodomain recognizes AxGGT directly (or AxGGTxAx with all resolved contacts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Court et al, 2005</xref>). When aligning and superimposing the DNA moieties of the TRF1 and HOT1 crystal structures, the difference in binding is easily visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). With respect to TRF1, HOT1 is shifted âdown' (5â²â3â²) the major groove by about one base and towards the subsequent telomeric repeat.</p>
        <p>Our crystal structure reveals in atomic detail how HOT1 specifically recognizes and binds 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats by means of its homeodomain. We could underpin these findings with mutational analyses and DNA pull-down assays, and we conclude that K335 is a key residue for telomere recognition and binding in HOT1.</p>

        <title>HOT1âtelomere associations correlate with the degree of telomere processing</title>
        <p>To investigate the interaction between HOT1 and telomeres <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analysed HOT1 intracellular localization by immunoFISH (immunohistochemistry combined with fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization) microscopy in HeLa cells. In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">DÃ©jardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>), HOT1 showed a nuclear-punctuated localization pattern, but in contrast to TRF1 and TRF2 only associated with a subset of telomeres. Colocalization between HOT1 and telomeric DNA was observed in about 90% of all cells, with on average 4.5 HOT1 and telomeric foci colocalizing per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4a</xref>). To study the HOT1 localization in another cell type, we performed IF stainings in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, in this setting we observed a higher degree of colocalization of HOT1 with telomeres, with an average of 13.5 HOT1 and TRF1 foci colocalizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). In telomerase-positive cancer cells, such as HeLa, only a small fraction of telomeres is actively processed, as telomerase is only associated with a few telomeres at any given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">JÃ¡dy et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Tomlinson et al, 2006</xref>). Here most telomeres are believed to exist in a âclosed' state, while only some telomeres are in an âopen', actively processed state. In contrast, ES cells have high telomerase activity and maintain long telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Varela et al, 2011</xref>). We reasoned that more colocalization events of HOT1 with telomeres might reflect the degree of active telomere extension in these cells. If this was true, then cells that very actively extend their telomeres should have the highest frequency of HOT1âtelomere associations. To test this hypothesis, we carried out IF stainings for HOT1 on pachytene chromosome spreads from mouse spermatocytes, in which telomerase very actively elongates telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Eisenhauer et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kozik et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Yashima et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Riou et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Tanemura et al, 2005</xref>), using SYCP3 as a marker for the synaptonemal complex/the chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Adelfalk et al, 2009</xref>). In agreement with a correlation between telomere processing and HOT1âtelomere association, HOT1 robustly localized to telomeres on all spreads analysed with on average 87% of chromosome ends being HOT1 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also confirmed this frequent association of HOT1 with telomeres in mouse testes sections using the same IF set-up. Again, we could confirm the prominent localization of HOT1 to telomeres in SYCP3-positive pachytene cells, highlighting the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our discovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Together, this data validates the <italic>in vivo</italic> localization of HOT1 to telomeres and suggests that HOT1 is a dynamic telomere-binding protein, putatively associated with actively processed telomeres.</p>

        <title>HOT1 interacts with the active telomerase complex and associates with CBs</title>
        <p>To gain further insights about HOT1 function at telomeres, we performed HOT1 immunoprecipitation assays combined with quantitative MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Vermeulen et al, 2008</xref>), using both a polyclonal rabbit and a monoclonal mouse HOT1 antibody and SILAC-labelled nuclear protein extracts from HeLa cells. HOT1 itself was recovered with SILAC ratios indicative of specific binding to the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6a</xref>). We also identified several proteins relevant to telomere homeostasis: the four core components of box H/ACA snoRNPs (DKC1, GAR1, NHP2 and NOP10; all part of the active telomerase RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Wang and Meier, 2004</xref>)) and the Ku70âKu80 heterodimer proteins. We validated several of these interactions by co-IP experiments, confirming a physical interaction of endogenous HOT1 with components of the active telomerase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3âS6</xref>). In addition, CB proteins, notably the CB-scaffolding and -marker protein Coilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Cioce and Lamond, 2005</xref>), were strongly enriched in our IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3âS6</xref>), indicating that HOT1 functions in the CB, where telomerase is assembled and potentially brought together with telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Cioce and Lamond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">JÃ¡dy et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Tomlinson et al, 2006</xref>), or in association with CB components in the nucleoplasm. We could further validate these interactions with analogous immunoprecipitations using extracts from mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). It is noteworthy that in none of our HOT1 IPs any of the shelterin components were enriched and that in agreement with this HOT1 was not identified in a reciprocal IP of the shelterin component POT1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>), suggesting that HOT1 does not directly interact with the shelterin complex.</p>
        <p>The interaction of HOT1 with the active telomerase complex components box H/ACA snoRNPs subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Wang and Meier, 2004</xref>) raises the possibility that HOT1 binds to active telomerase. To substantiate this hypothesis, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments followed by telomerase activity measurements using the quantitative TRAP (telomere repeat amplification protocol) assay for immunoprecipitates obtained from IPs for both HOT1 and the positive control DKC1. Indeed, we detected telomerase activity in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5D</xref>), while five other nuclear DNA-binding proteins (TBP, YY1, STAT3, Histone3[K4me3] and CENP-B) did not show any enrichment of telomerase activity compared to an IgG control. Antibodies against TRF1 and TRF2 immunoprecitated telomerase activity, putatively dependent on the previously established link between the shelterin component TPP1 and telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Xin et al, 2007</xref>). In sum, we conclude that HOT1 associates with the active telomerase complex.</p>
        <p>To corroborate the physical interaction between HOT1 and Coilin, we performed IF stainings for HOT1 and Coilin in nonsynchronized HeLa cells. After deconvolution and 3D reconstruction of the IF images the colocalization between both proteins was analysed. In about 85% of all cells analysed, we observed colocalization of one to seven HOT1 foci with CBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>). Remarkably, HOT1 foci preferentially localized to the periphery of Coilin, reminiscent of previous findings on the association of telomerase RNA and telomeres with CBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">JÃ¡dy et al, 2006</xref>). This data underscores the idea that HOT1 might be associated with actively processed telomeres in a telomerase-positive context.</p>

        <title>HOT1 is a positive regulator of telomere length</title>
        <p>The differential degree of the HOT1âtelomere colocalization, and the association with the active telomerase complex as well as the reminiscent localization to the periphery of CBs, suggested that HOT1 might be involved in telomere maintenance. To investigate this, we depleted both HOT1 and TCAB1 in HeLa cells with endoribonuclease-prepared siRNA (esiRNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Kittler et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). Here TCAB1, as a recently described DKC1 interaction partner necessary for proper trafficking of TERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Venteicher et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Zhong et al, 2011</xref>), serves as a reference for the extent of telomere shortening that can be assigned as telomerase dependent. From HOT1- and TCAB1-depleted, as well as control-transfected cells, metaphase spreads were prepared 3 days post transfection and telomere length was determined using quantitative telomeric FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">LondoÃ±o-Vallejo et al, 2001</xref>). Knockdown of both HOT1 and TCAB1 resulted in significant telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>) as indicated by reduced FISH signals. Here the entire populations of FISH signals shifted towards weaker signals, indicating that telomeres globally shortened in the absence of HOT1. In these experiments the distributions after HOT1 and TCAB1 knockdown were indistinguishable from each other, indicating that their effect on telomere homeostasis is similar. Consistent with this finding we also observed a significant increase in the appearance of signal-free chromosome ends both upon HOT1 and TCAB1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figures 6B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). We also obtained qualitatively similar results by measuring telomere length after HOT1 and TCAB1 knockdowns 3 days post transfection by a universal, single telomere-elongation length analysis (STELA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6DâF</xref>). Again, depletion of both HOT1 and TCAB1 led to shorter telomere length with a shortening of on average 700 and 600 bp, respectively. Given the short nature of telomeres in this cell line (on average, 5 kb measured by STELA) and the substantial contribution of variant repeats and subtelomeric DNA to this value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Aubert et al, 2012</xref>), our quantitative FISH and STELA data mutually confirm HOT1 as a positive regulator of telomere length that quantitatively behaves similar to the established telomerase pathway member TCAB1.</p>
        <p>Next we performed telomere length measurements after HOT1 depletion at different time points. We reasoned that if HOT1 is influencing telomere length in a mode dependent on telomerase activity, its depletion should lead to a gradual loss of telomeric tracts. To test this, we performed telomere length measurements upon HOT1 depletion as a time course over several days. Indeed, the telomeric signal was gradually reduced in the absence of HOT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figures 7A and B</xref>). Hence, the telomere length changes observed due to manipulations of HOT1 levels are in agreement with telomerase-dependent changes.</p>
        <p>In a complementary experiment, we transiently overexpressed FLAGâHOT1 in HeLa cells and analysed telomere length 3 days after transfection. Consistent with the observed telomere shortening upon HOT1 depletion, telomeres were elongated upon its overexpression as indicated by an increase of the entire population of FISH signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figures 7C and D</xref>). The qFISH data suggests that the telomere length regulation exerted by HOT1 is dependent on its telomere-binding capacity. To test whether HOT1-dependent telomere elongation indeed requires DNA binding, we used a HOT1ÎHomeobox variant. <italic>In vitro</italic>-binding studies with recombinant HOT1ÎHomeobox demonstrated that the deletion of this domain indeed abolished binding to telomeric 5â²-TTAGGG-3â² repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref>) and the lack of binding also coincides with loss of telomeric localization <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4b</xref>). To examine functional consequences of DNA-binding-deficient HOT1 on telomere length regulation, we overexpressed FLAGâHOT1ÎHomeobox in HeLa cells. In contrast to telomere elongation upon expression of full-length FLAGâHOT1, the expression of FLAGâHOT1ÎHomeobox did not lead to an effect on telomere length in comparison to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figures 7C and D</xref>). Thus, the HOT1âtelomere interaction is essential for telomere elongation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that HOT1 acts as a positive regulator of telomere length. The fact that overexpression of HOT1 can stimulate telomere lengthening further suggests that similar to TERT and TERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Cristofari and Lingner, 2006</xref>), HOT1 is a limiting factor, at least in this cellular context.</p>

        <title>TERT binding to chromatin is dependent on HOT1</title>
        <p>The combined features of HOT1âdirect binding to telomeric dsDNA, preferential localization to telomeres in settings of active processing, association with active telomerase, localization to the periphery of CBs and a positive effect on telomere lengthâsuggest a putative role of HOT1 in telomerase recruitment. To test this possibility we assayed TERT binding to chromatin in the absence of HOT1, based on a previous experimental set-up that contributed to the identification of TPP1 as a telomerase recruiter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Tejera et al, 2010</xref>). To avoid potential convolutions of experimental results by the presence of residual HOT1 protein, we established a HOT1 genetrap mouse. In <italic>Hot1</italic><sup>Gt(pU-21T)346Card/(Gt(pU-21T)346Card</sup> mice, the genetrap construct is inserted in the first intron of the <italic>Hot1</italic> gene. As the start codon resides in exon 2, we expected that protein synthesis would be entirely abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). To verify this, we established mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of the different genotypes from littermate embryos and performed immunofluorescence stainings with our HOT1 antibody. While wild-type cells showed the typical nuclear-punctuated pattern, HOT1 signals were absent in <italic>Hot1</italic><sup>Gt(pU-21T)346Card/(Gt(pU-21T)346Card</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8C</xref>). Based on this data and for the sake of simplicity, we will refer to this as <italic>Hot1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> genotype. We then performed the chromatin fractionation assay and could, as expected, detect TERT on the chromatin fraction of wild-type MEFs, but not on chromatin fractions from <italic>Tert</italic><sup>â/â</sup> MEFs. Notably, the TERT signal was also absent when extracts of <italic>Hot1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> MEFs were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8D</xref>), reminiscent of previous data on TPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Tejera et al, 2010</xref>). This data indicate that HOT1 indeed contributes to telomerase recruitment <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, HOT1 as a dynamic and differential telomere-binding protein contributes to telomeraseâtelomere association, mechanistically underlying its function as a positive regulator of telomere length.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have adapted our SILAC-based DNAâprotein interaction screening technique to repetitive sequences as a straightforward and robust approach to identify novel interactions. In addition to the established telomere-binding proteins and their tight interaction partner, we have identified HOT1 as the first direct telomere-binder that positively regulates telomere length. HOT1 has previously been found as a telomere-associated factor that localizes to some telomeres in HeLa cells using the PICh approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">DÃ©jardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, this is the only one of several recent large scale studies searching for telomere-associated factors, which has identified HOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">DÃ©jardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Giannone et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Nittis et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Lee et al, 2011</xref>), possibly because also in this approach telomeric DNA was used as bait, rather than using the shelterin components. While by the PICh approach several hundreds of putative telomere-associated factors were identified and the PICh technique is, in general, addressing the global composition of (telomeric) chromatin, our approach is more apt to rapidly identify the direct DNA binders and their tight interaction partners as illustrated by the identification of HOT1. Thus, our <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution assay seems particularly suited to discover novel direct telomere binders.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the other direct telomere-binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, HOT1 does not localize to all telomeres and the degree of telomere association varies between cell types. While <italic>in situ</italic> telomerase activity is limited in HeLa cells to a simple maintenance of short telomeres, it is increased in mouse ES cells and is very high in mouse spermatogonia and spermatocytes, where telomere length is reset to the very long telomeres observed in mature sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Eisenhauer et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Kozik et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Yashima et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Riou et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Tanemura et al, 2005</xref>). The fact that the nature of the HOT1 association with telomeres seems to be more transient in normally cycling telomerase-positive cancer cells compared to an intermediate degree of association in mouse ES cells, and to a prominent and robust association with telomeres in mouse spermatocytes, is consistent with promoting telomerase-dependent telomere lengthening. This raises the possibility that HOT1 selectively interacts with actively processed telomeres. How exactly this interaction is regulated and which precise step in telomere lengthening HOT1 promotes will have to be addressed in the future.</p>
      <p>While HOT1 localizes to a subset of telomeres together with shelterin components, our HOT1 immunoprecipitation experiments failed to establish any putative association between HOT1 and shelterin complex members. Likewise, we could not retrieve HOT1 after a POT1âIP, which is in agreement with several other studies that searched for shelterin-associated factors either by immunoprecipitation or by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Giannone et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Nittis et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Lee et al, 2011</xref>). Our comparison of the cocrystal structures of telomeric DNA with the HOT1, TRF1 and TRF2 homeodomains indicates that while HOT1 is shifted âdown' in 5â²â3â² direction by one base towards the following telomeric repeat, the binding sites are largely overlapping. Hence, it is intriguing how these proteins coexist at telomeres, how they compete for binding sites and whether the shelterin proteins are found interspersed on telomeres or whether there are discrete, mutually exclusive patches along the telomeric tracts. This might further contribute to answering the question how HOT1 is selectively restricted to a subset of telomeres.</p>
      <p>How does HOT1 fit into the current view of telomere homeostasis? TCAB1 (WDR79/WRAP53) has been shown to be required for proper localization of CAB box containing scaRNPs to CBs, including TERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Tycowski et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Venteicher et al, 2009</xref>). Similar to HOT1, TCAB1 acts as a positive regulator of telomere length by recruiting TERC to CBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Venteicher et al, 2009</xref>). The telomere-binding properties of HOT1 and its functional consequences, which are quantitatively similar to those of TCAB1, suggest that HOT1 may act downstream of TCAB1. The putative mechanism may involve recruiting telomerase-containing CBs to telomeres, and thus promoting telomerase association with telomeres, perhaps through additional interactions involving TPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abreu et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Tejera et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Zaug et al, 2010</xref>). The fact that overexpression of HOT1 further stimulates telomere lengthening suggests that HOT1, similar to TERT and TERC, is also a limiting factor. Therefore, the shelterin and CST complexes, and the controlled levels of TERT, TERC and HOT1, may all act cooperatively to define a mean telomere length in the cell.</p>
      <p>Our chromatin fractionation analysis indicates that HOT1 is required for TERT recruitment to chromatin and, therefore, qualifies as a telomerase recruitment factor. Similarly, TPP1 has been established as a telomerase recruiter likely by (direct or indirect) interaction with TERT via its TEL patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Nandakumar et al, 2012</xref>), but based on our immunoprecipitation data and previous studies there is no indication for an interaction between HOT1 and TPP1. This discrepancy may be explained by a step-wise telomerase recruitment model, in which HOT1 simply acts before TPP1. Previous reports have shown that POT1âTPP1 act as a processivity factor for telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Wang et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Latrick and Cech, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Zaug et al, 2010</xref>). Enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> processivity would also result in an increased residence time and a higher affinity to telomeres, thus explaining the reduction of telomeraseâtelomere association in TPP1 knockdown/knockout conditions. Given that HOT1 preferentially localizes to telomeres in settings of high <italic>in situ</italic> telomerase activity, one possibility is that HOT1 contributes to an âopen' telomere state that allows/promotes telomere elongation. In such a model, HOT1 might contribute to rendering telomeres accessible and/or contributes to the delivery of telomerase to âopen' telomeres. In this scenario, TPP1 would contribute more prominently to maintaining telomerase at telomeres and, thus, to processivity stimulation. Undoubtedly, the mechanistic contribution of both factors and potential genetic interactions are exciting avenues for future research.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence and immunoFISH stainings on cycling cells</title>
        <p>For immunofluorescence stainings, cells were seeded 24 h before the treatment on either glass coverslips (0.17 mm, assorted glass, Thermo Scientific) or in LabTek II chambered coverglass chambers (Labtek). After a brief wash with 1x PBS cells were fixed in 10% formalin solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min at RT, followed by two washes with 1 Ã PBS+30 mM glycine. Cells were then permeabilized with 1 Ã PBS+0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4Â°C, followed by again two washes with 1 Ã PBS+30 mM glycine. Afterwards, cells were blocked in blocking solution (1 Ã PBS, 0.2% fish-skin gelatine (Sigma Aldrich)) for 15 min at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at RT. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-HOT1 (MPI-CBG Antibody Facility, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Coilin (sc-32860, Santa Cruz, 1:500), and goat anti-GFP (MPI-CBG Antibody Facility, 1:2000). Cells were washed three times for 3 min each in blocking solution followed by a 30-min incubation at RT with secondary antibodies, which were diluted in blocking solution. As secondary antibodies, fluorescent-labelled donkey anti-rabbit-IgG or donkey anti-mouse-IgG antibodies with either Alexa488, Alexa555, Alexa594 or Alexa647 as fluorochromes (1:500, Invitrogen) were used. After three final washes for 3 min each in blocking solution, slides were briefly rinsed in distilled water and mounted using DAPI Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen).

        <p>The detailed protocol of esiRNA production has been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Kittler et al, 2005</xref>). Briefly, optimal regions for designing esiRNAs were chosen using the Deqor design algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Henschel et al, 2004</xref>) in order to fulfill two criteria: to obtain the most efficient silencing trigger in terms of silencing efficiency, and to get lowest chances to cross-silence other genes.

        <p>The DBD of human HOT1 recognizes telomeric DNA in a sequence-specific manner. (<bold>A</bold>) Sequence-specific pull-down of recombinant HOT1, TRF1 (positive control) and TBP (TATA-binding protein, negative control). Proteins were incubated with dsDNA of telomeric repeats (5â²-TTAGGG-3â²), the control sequence (5â²-GTGAGT-3â²), the subtelomeric repeat variants (5â²-TCAGGG-3â², 5â²-TGAGGG-3â² and 5â²-TTGGGG-3â², as well as the <italic>C. elegans</italic> telomere repeat 5â²-TTAGGC-3â²). All DNA substrates were concatemerized from 60 bp oligonucleotides to larger DNA fragments (on average at least 1 kb). (<bold>B</bold>) ChIP of telomeric DNA using antibodies against HOT1, TRF2 (positive control), GFP and IgG (negative controls). Representative slotblot images are shown for ChIP from HeLa extracts after hybridization with a telomeric and genomic control. Input dilutions demonstrate the linearity of the signals acquired. (<bold>C</bold>) Structure of the DBD of HOT1 bound to double-stranded telomeric DNA. The protein is shown as a cartoon representation (orange), whereas DNA is shown as a stick model (grey). The interacting amino acid residues in HOT1 are shown as blue sticks, water molecules as red spheres and proteinâDNA contacts are visualized as green dashed lines. (<bold>D</bold>) Schematic representation of all proteinâDNA contacts in the complex. (<bold>E</bold>) Sequence-specific pull-down of FLAGâHOT1 and selected single mutations to investigate binding specificity. Proteins were incubated with either telomeric repeats (5â²-TTAGGG-3â²) or a control oligonucleotide (5â²-GTGAGT-3â²). (<bold>F</bold>) Atomic details of DNA sequence recognition by HOT1. K335 of helix 3 is involved in direct hydrogen bonding to O6 of G8 and O6 of G9. N332 of helix 3 specifically recognizes A11â² of the complementary strand by forming two direct H-bonds with the bicyclic ring system of A11â² (N6 and N7) (left panel). R271 of the N-terminal arm binds two bases of an AT base pair, directly to T9â² and via a water-mediated H-bond to A12 (right panel).</p>
