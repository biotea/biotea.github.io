    <p id="P1">Activating mutations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway components cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. We report that MPPH patients lacking upstream PI3K-AKT pathway mutations carry <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in <italic>cyclin D2</italic> (<italic>CCND2)</italic>, clustered around a residue that can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Mutant CCND2 was resistant to proteasomal degradation compared to wild type (WT) protein <italic>in vitro</italic>. The PI3K-AKT pathway modulates GSK-3Î² activity<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and accordingly, cells from patients with <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>PIK3R2</italic> or <italic>AKT3</italic> mutations similarly accumulated CCND2. CCND2 was expressed at higher levels in the brains of mouse embryos expressing activated Akt3. <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation of mutant <italic>CCND2</italic> into the embryonic mouse brain produced more proliferating transfected progenitors and a smaller fraction exiting the cell cycle compared to cells electroporated with the WT sequence. These observations suggest that cyclin D2 stabilization, due to <italic>CCND2</italic> mutation or PI3K-AKT activation, provides a unifying mechanism in PI3K-AKT related megalencephaly syndromes.</p>
    <p id="P2">Germline mutations of <italic>PIK3R2</italic> and <italic>AKT3</italic> result in MPPH<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, while postzygotic mutations of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> cause megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MCAP)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and postzygotic mutations of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>AKT3</italic> cause isolated hemimegalencephaly<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. We previously failed to detect mutations in <italic>PIK3R2</italic> or <italic>AKT3</italic> in 35% of probands with MPPH<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that mutation-negative patients have <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in one or more novel genes, and performed whole exome sequencing in two child parent trios (JT-144, LR11-424) and one child-parent pair (LR02-064).</p>
    <p id="P3">We identified germline mutations in <italic>CCND2</italic> in all three patients (p.Thr280Ala in one and p.Lys270* in 2 unrelated subjects), confirmed to be <italic>de novo</italic> by Sanger sequencing. None of the identified variants were present in dbSNP build 132, the 1000 Genomes Project, the NHLBI exome variant server of 6500 exomes, or in-house exome databases (Online Methods).

    <p id="P4">All identified mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>). Notably, 9 of 12 involved p.Thr280 or p.Pro281 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The p.Thr280Asn mutation occurred in 3 subjects while p.Lys270*, p.Thr280Ala, and p.Pro281Arg were found in 2 subjects each. Murine cyclin D2 can be phosphorylated on p.Thr280 <italic>in vitro</italic> by GSK-3Î², rendering Ccnd2 susceptible to ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The p.Thr280Ala mutant cyclin D2 cannot be phosphorylated, does not become polyubiquitinated, and thus is resistant to degradation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, all mutations in our MPPH cohort either alter highly conserved residues surrounding p.Thr280, or truncate the protein prior to this phosphorylation site (p.Lys270X). As the latter mutation lies in the final exon, it is predicted not to induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.</p>
    <p id="P5">To test whether mutations at particular residues in MPPH patients result in accumulation of degradation-resistant cyclin D2, we transfected HEK293 cells with either WT or mutant (p.Thr280Ala, p.Pro281Arg, p.Val284Gly, and p.Lys270*) human <italic>CCND2</italic> myc-tagged constructs. Cells were treated with cycloheximide at 0.05 mg/ml 24 hours post-transfection to block protein translation, and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). A rapid reduction in cyclin D2 was seen in cells transfected with WT constructs following cycloheximide treatment. This was not observed in cells transfected with mutant constructs. Thus, MPPH-associated mutations in <italic>CCND2</italic> result in accumulation of unphosphorylated degradation-resistant cyclin D2.</p>
    <p id="P6">Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway inhibits GSK-3Î²-mediated phosphorylation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the activating mutations previously observed in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>PIK3R2,</italic> and <italic>AKT3</italic> would also result in accumulation of degradation-resistant cyclin D2 through downstream inhibition of GSK-3Î². Endogenous CCND2 levels were examined in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (p.Glu453del), <italic>PIK3R2</italic> (p.Gly373Arg), or <italic>AKT3</italic> (p.Arg465Trp). Following cycloheximide treatment, we observed a decrease in CCND2 levels in control cells. In contrast, CCND2 in patient cells was resistant to degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). These results suggest that megalencephaly-associated mutations in components of the PI3K-AKT pathway share the same functional endpoint as the mutations observed in <italic>CCND2</italic>: namely inhibition of proteasomal degradation of cyclin D2.</p>
    <p id="P7">The PI3K-AKT pathway inactivates GSK-3Î² by phosphorylation of the S9 residue<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, which should interfere with GSK-3Î² dependent phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D2. Activating mutations previously described in PIK3R2 and PIK3CA result in activation of AKT3<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. To further test the relationship between cyclin D2 and this pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the levels of CCND2 in E14.5 embryonic cortex of mice homozygous for a gain-of-function <italic>Akt3<sup>D219V</sup></italic> mutant allele<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Quantitative western blot analysis revealed a 30% increase in the pS9, inactive GSK-3Î² phosphoprotein, associated with a 30-40% increase in cyclin D2, equivalent to the increase in cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>

In embryonic mouse brain, Ccnd2 is expressed in some VZ radial glial cells (RGCs) that co-label for Pax6, but primarily â though certainly not exclusively â Ccnd2- positive cells co-localize with Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) in the SVZ<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.

In the human neocortex, CCND2 is expressed more robustly than cyclin D1 by 19 gestational weeks<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Thus, elevated CCND2 levels may enlarge brain size by maintaining cells in cycle and increasing progenitor numbers, while diminished CCND2 expression reduces brain volume by allowing cell cycle exit, resulting in progenitor pool depletion<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P9">We investigated the importance of CCND2 p.Thr280 and the neighboring p.Pro281 residue for VZ/SVZ divisions by testing mutations, including those found in MPPH patients, using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUEP) in mouse embryos (Online Methods). Western blot of HEK293 cells transfected with these constructs demonstrated that <italic>CCND2</italic> sequences placed upstream of the IRES-eGFP cassette were actively translated into protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Immunostaining of embryonic cortex following IUEP confirmed that expression of nuclear CCND2 in GFP-positive cells was elevated after transfection with mutant forms of CCND2 compared to cells transfected with GFP only or with untransfected cells (<italic>i.e.</italic> GFP-) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">IUEP was performed at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and embryos were collected 48 hours later. Immunohistochemistry using anti-GFP and anti-Ki67 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) showed that 85% of control cells expressing GFP alone did not co-label for Ki67, and therefore, had exited the cell cycle; a large proportion had migrated to the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a,f,k</xref>). Significantly more GFP-positive cells expressing WT cyclin D2 also co-labeled for Ki67 and were actively dividing (27.6 Â± 3.0% of GFP+ WT cyclin D2 vs. 14.6 Â± 2.6% of GFP+ only controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 b,g,k</xref>). Electroporation of a mutant construct mimicking phosphorylation at Thr280 (p.Thr280Asp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 d,i,k</xref>) yielded results statistically indistinguishable from the WT CCND2, suggesting that the transfected WT protein was near-maximally phosphorylated at residue 280. However, compared to the exogenous WT protein, cells expressing mutant CCND2 (p.Thr280Ala) had a significantly higher percentage of GFP+/Ki67+ co-labeled cells (54.9 Â± 4.9% of GFP+ p.Thr280Ala vs. 27.6 Â± 3.0% of GFP+ WT cyclin D2 and 35.5 Â± 5.3% GFP+ p.Thr280Asp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 c,h,k</xref>). Another MPPH-mutation (p.Pro281Arg) also produced a higher percentage of proliferating GFP+ cells than the WT sequence (60.5 Â± 4.2% GFP+ p.Pro281Arg vs. 27.6 Â± 3.0% of GFP+ WT cyclin D2, 35.5 Â± 5.3% GFP+ p.Thr280Asp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4 e,j,k</xref>). The significance of these comparisons is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. These data support a mechanism in which aberrantly stabilized CCND2 mediates abnormal proliferation leading to increased neural progenitor numbers.</p>
    <p id="P11">MPPH-associated CCND2 mutation effects on cell cycle function were investigated by determining the proportion of electroporated (GFP-positive) cells undergoing mitosis. We used immunodetection of phosphohistone H3 (PH3), a marker of cells in M-phase, following transfection with WT, phosphodeficient (p.Thr280Ala), and phosphomimetic (p.Thr280Asp) forms of CCND2. Electroporation of the WT CCND2 sequence resulted in 2.83 Â± 0.37% of GFP+ cells also being labeled for PH3, most of which were located within the VZ and SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a,d</xref>). The phosphodeficient CCND2 construct significantly increased cell numbers labeled for GFP and PH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 b,d</xref>) compared to the WT sequence (6.41 Â± 0.22% p.Thr280Ala vs. 2.83 Â± 0.37% WT CCND2, <italic>p</italic>=0.000054). Lastly, expression of the phosphomimetic sequence yielded a 3.39 Â± 0.49% overlap between GFP and PH3-immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 c,d</xref>), which was significantly different from the phosphodeficient, but not the WT CCND2, construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Thus, the phosphodeficient form of CCND2 is more effective in promoting mitosis compared to transfection with either the WT or phosphomimetic CCND2 sequences.</p>
    <p id="P12">To examine the effect of WT and mutant CCND2 expression on cell cycle exit, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant dams 24 hours post-IUEP. After 24 hours tissues were collected and sections stained with anti-GFP, anti-BrdU, and anti-Ki67 antibodies to determine the proliferative fraction (P-fraction, ie: cells that remain in the cell cycle, GFP+/BrdU+/Ki67+) and exit fraction (ie: those cells that have exited the cell cycle 24 hours post-BrdU injection, GFP+/BrdU+/Ki67-). Following electroporation of the WT CCND2, 40.8 Â± 4.4% of GFP+ cells were in the P-fraction, while 59.2 Â± 4.4% of cells accumulated in the exit fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e,h,k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). After transfection with the phosphodeficient CCND2 mutation, progenitors displayed a higher P-fraction (59.3 Â± 3.6%) and corresponding decrease in the exit fraction (40.7 Â± 3.6%) relative to the WT CCND2 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e,f,h,i,k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The phosphomimetic CCND2 construct yielded P-fractions (45.4 Â± 1.4%) and exit fractions (54.6 Â± 1.4%) statistically identical to the WT CCND2 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e,g,h,j,k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, expression of the phosphomimetic CCND2 construct resulted in a lower P-fraction and higher exit fraction compared to the phosphodeficient CCND2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f,g,i,j,k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Thus, expression of phosphodeficient forms of CCND2 increases progenitor proliferation and the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis, with a concomitant decrease in the exit fraction.</p>
    <p id="P13">Lastly, we investigated how transfection of cortical progenitors with WT and mutant CCND2 forms would impact the RGC and IPC populations. Previous work has detailed the transition of progenitors from Pax6-expressing RGCs to Tbr2-positive IPCs during development within the cortex<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, we examined the expression of Pax6 and Tbr2 in electroporated progenitors. First, we examined the proportion of electroporated progenitors that co-express Pax6. Introduction of the GFP only control generated 21.5 Â± 1.5% of GFP+ cells that were positive for Pax6 as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.3a</xref>). Electroporation with either the WT CCND2 or the phosphomimetic CCND2 construct did not result in an increase in the proportion of progenitors that were immunopositive for Pax6 (20.1 Â± 1.1%, and 23.0 Â± 0.6%, respectively). In contrast, electroporation of the phosphodeficient CCND2 construct caused a significant increase in the proportion of GFP+ progenitors that co-express Pax6, over all other groups (27.7 Â± 1.4%), indicating that phosphodeficient CCND2 leads to expansion of RGCs in the developing cortex. We then found that the GFP only control resulted in 9.4 Â± 0.7% of GFP+ cells also expressing Tbr2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.3b</xref>). In contrast, the WT CCND2 sequence and expression of the phosphomimetic sequence generated significant increases in the proportion of electroporated cells (17.6 Â± 2.1%, 15.3 Â± 1.7%, respectively) that were also immunopositive for Tbr2, signifying an expansion of the IPC population. The phosphodeficient CCND2 mutant produced an even greater, 27.4 Â± 2.9%, expansion of progenitors expressing both GFP and Tbr2, which was significantly different from the GFP control, WT CCND2, and phosphomimetic groups. Thus, the phosphodeficient, degradation resistant form of CCND2 causes an expansion of both the RGC and IPC population. We suggest it is this expansion that underlies the megalencephaly in MPPH patients. The WT CCND2 sequence resulted in an increase in the proportion of transfected progenitors that co-express Tbr2, but not Pax6, suggesting that WT CCND2 might preferentially promote expansion of the IPC population.</p>
    <p id="P14">Polymicrogyria in MPPH patients may be related to an altered relationship between basal progenitors and radial glia. A homozygous loss of function mutation in <italic>EOMES</italic> (<italic>TBR2</italic>), expressed in IPCs, was previously associated with a microcephaly-polymicrogyria phenotype<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

We note that <italic>CCND2</italic>-mutated MPPH patients have polydactyly more frequently than those with PI3K-AKT pathway mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), but the mechanism underlying this phenotypic difference remains to be explored.</p>
    <p id="P15">Thus, we have identified a highly specific pattern of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in <italic>CCND2</italic> in 12 subjects with MPPH.

Evidence presented here supports that these two types of mutational events result in a common functional endpoint, namely increased cyclin D2 activity in neural precursors due to its intracellular accumulation. The data suggest that pathological stabilization of cyclin D2 in the developing cerebral cortex may represent a unifying mechanism for the development of megalencephaly and polymicrogyria in MPPH and other PI3K-AKT associated megalencephaly syndromes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p>

          <title><italic>In utero</italic> electroporation and BrdU injections</title>
          <p id="P26">Electroporations were carried out at E13.5. The pregnant dam was anesthetized with Isoflurane (Butler Schein, Dublin, OH, USA) and a laparotomy was performed to expose the uterus. DNA was diluted 1:20 in Fast Green (Sigma-Aldrich) to achieve a final concentration of 1 Î¼g/Î¼l. Then, 1 Î¼g DNA was injected into the lateral ventricle of each embryo. Tweezertrodes (7 mm platinum, BTX, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) were placed over the injection site and then five 50-ms pulses at 42 V were delivered with 1-s intervals between each pulse using a BTX-ECM830 electroporator (BTX, Harvard Apparatus) to introduce DNA into the cortex. Embryos were returned to the abdominal cavity, the wound was sutured; dams were allowed to recover and were closely monitored. Embryos were harvested at 48 hours post-IUEP at E15.5. Embryo brains were collected in cold 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and screened for GFP expression using a stereomicroscope (Leica M165 FC, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Brains were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS with 7% sucrose overnight at 4Â°C. The following day, brains were transferred to 15% sucrose and then 30% sucrose in 1x PBS, shaking at 4Â°C, until properly sunk. Brains were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and stored at â20Â°C.</p>
          <p id="P27">A subset of pregnant dams were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 50 mg/kg at E14.5 (24 hours post-IUEP). All tissue was then harvested at E15.5 (48 hours post-IUEP).</p>

          <p id="P28">Brains were sectioned coronally at 12 Î¼m on a cryostat (HM505E, Microm, Mars, PA, USA) and collected on glass slides. Sections to be stained were washed 3x with 1x PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and then subjected to antigen retrieval with steam in 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris pH 8 (GFP and Pax6 dual labeling) for 20 mins or 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6 for 15 mins (for all other staining). Slides were allowed to come to RT, rinsed in 1x PBS-T, and then blocked for 1 h at RT in 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) in 1x PBS-T. Antibodies were diluted in blocking medium and were used as follows: anti-GFP (600-101-215, goat IgG, Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA, USA, 1:10,000), anti-Ki67 (RM-9106-S1, rabbit IgG, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, 1:1000), anti-phosphohistone H3 (PH3, 06-570, rabbit IgG, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 1:2000), anti-BrdU, 555627, mouse IgG, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, 1:500), anti-Pax6 (PRB-278P, rabbit IgG, Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, 1:1000), and anti-Tbr2 (ab23345, rabbit IgG, Abcam, 1:2000). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4Â°C. The following day, slides were washed 3x in 1x PBS-T and incubated with Alexa fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA, 1:1000 in blocking solution) for 2 h at RT. Slides were then washed and coverslipped with ProLong Antifade Kit (Life Technologies).</p>
          <p id="P29">An additional set of brains was processed for paraffin sectioning as previously described<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.

After the primary antibody incubations, sections were incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody (1:400, 1 hr), and then peroxidase-conjugated tertiary antibody for 1 hr following manufacturerâs instructions (Covance). Tissue was then subjected to a 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction (Covance). Next, tissue was thoroughly washed and then blocked, and incubated with anti-GFP antibodies (as above, 1:500) overnight. Fluorescent secondary antibody incubations were carried out as described above.</p>

Sections through the entire electroporated area (rostro-caudal) were analyzed. Embryos that expressed GFP through the cortex were analyzed. Those that did not fit these criteria were eliminated from analyses and all embryos that met these criteria were quantified. For all IUEP experiments, embryo brains were assigned a random number that the investigator performing the counts was not privy to, so as to reduce bias. After the counts were completed, embryos were matched to their respective numbers and assigned to appropriate experimental groups.</p>

          <p id="P37">Samples were reduced and boiled at 70Â°C for 10 minutes. Equal amounts of protein were run on polyacrylamide gels as above (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Membranes to be stained with anti-CCND2 and anti-GFP antibodies were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in 1x Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Membranes were then incubated in primary antibodies as follows: anti-CCND2 (sc-53637/sc-56305, mouse IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA, 1:1000) and anti-GFP (see above, goat IgG, 1:4,000), diluted in block solution overnight at 4Â°C with slight agitation. The following day, membranes were washed and then incubated in secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT diluted in Odyssey LI-COR solution with 0.05% Tween 20 using LI-COR secondary antibodies (1:10,000, donkey anti-mouse IRDye 800SCW and donkey anti-goat IRDye 680LT). Blots were then visualized on the Odyssey FC imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Quantitation was determined by serial dilution of lysates and fluorescent values within the linear range were used for determining relative levels, normalized to the loading control of total GSK-3Î². Primary antibodies used in the quantitative westerns included anti-CCND2 (as above), anti-CCND1 (ab134175, rabbit IgG, Abcam, 1:4000), anti-GSK-3Î² (9832, mouse IgG, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA, 1:2000), and anti-pS9-GSK-3Î² (9323, rabbit IgG, Cell Signaling, 1:1000).</p>

          <title>Western blotting of AKT3-D219V embryo brain lysates</title>
          <p id="P38">Embryo brains were harvested at E14.5. Lysates were prepared and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto polyacryl-amide gels for Western blot transfer and immunodetection as for cell cultures above. A total of three WT/Akt3-D219V/D219V littermate pairs were analyzed, providing three biological replicates. Each WT/Akt3-D219V/D219V pair was processed in parallel as follows: 21, 18, 15, 12, 9 or 6 Î¼l of lysate was loaded on a gel. Out of 6 data points for each biological replicate at least three were in the linear range, giving three technical replicates for each sample, for a total <italic>n</italic>=9. WT and mutants were then compared using a sign test and for every WT-mutant pair from the same litter and of the same dilution the sign of the difference was the same (e.g. CCND2 or CCND1 was greater in the mutant than WT littermate), for a two-sided level of significance of 0.02.</p>

        <p>Comparative ability of mutant and WT cyclin D2 (CCND2) to enhance neural progenitor proliferation in embryonic mouse brain. Two patient mutations (p.Thr280Ala and p.Pro281Arg) are compared to WT and phosphomimetic (p.Thr280Asp) CCND2. WT and mutant cDNAs were cloned into an IRES eGFP vector affording independent translation of both CCND2 and, from an internal ribosome entry site, eGFP. Electroporated (GFP+) cells expressed either GFP alone or together with human WT or mutant CCND2. Constructs (1 Î¼g each) were delivered to cortex by IUEP at E13.5 and embryos were harvested at E15.5. (<bold>a-e</bold>) Cortical sections were immunostained with an anti-GFP antibody. (<bold>f-j</bold>) The same sections were double immunolabeled (yellow) with anti-GFP (green) and proliferation marker, anti-Ki67 (red), antibodies. (<bold>a,f</bold>) Cells receiving vector without CCND2 are mostly no longer dividing and many have migrated up to the cortical plate. (<bold>b,g</bold>) More cells continue to divide (yellow cells, mostly in the SVZ/IZ) when overexpressing WT CCND2. (<bold>c,h,e,j</bold>) Progenitors expressing the phosphodeficient p.Thr280Ala or putative phosphodeficient p.Pro281Arg CCND2 found in MPPH patients show strikingly more proliferation and fewer GFP+ cells residing in the cortical plate. (<bold>d,i</bold>) A phosphomimetic (p.Thr280Asp) form of CCND2 is significantly less effective in promoting proliferation than the patient mutations.

        <p>Phosphodeficient CCND2 more effectively promotes proliferation and prevents neural progenitor cells from exiting the cell cycle. (<bold>a-d</bold>) Tissue sections immunostained with anti-GFP (green) and anti-PH3 (purple) antibodies following electroporation with WT, phosphodeficient (p.Thr280Ala), and phosphomimetic (p.Thr280Asp) CCND2. (<bold>a,b</bold>) Compared to WT CCND2 introduction of the phosphodeficient CCND2 resulted in a significant increase in the number of GFP+ and PH3+ double-labeled cells in the VZ/SVZ, (<bold>c</bold>) while the phosphomimetic CCND2 was no different from WT. (<bold>d</bold>) Quantification shows significantly more GFP+ PH3+ cells after introduction of phosphodeficient CCND2 compared to the WT (<italic>p</italic>=0.000054) or phosphomimetic sequences (<italic>p</italic>=0.00049).

(<bold>e-l</bold>) Comparison of actively proliferating (P-Fraction) and non-proliferating (Exit Fraction) cortical progenitors transfected with WT or mutant CCND2 constructs. (<bold>e-g</bold>) Cells were co-labeled with anti-GFP (green) and anti-BrdU (red) antibodies following BrdU injection at E14.5 (24 hours post-IUEP) and harvest at E15.5. (<bold>h-j</bold>) The same samples were also co-labeled with anti-Ki67 (blue) antibodies. (<bold>e,h,k)</bold> Expression of either the WT or (<bold>g,j,k</bold>) phosphomimetic (p.Thr280Asp) forms of CCND2 resulted in a similar increase in the percentage of progenitors in the exit fraction over the P-fraction (see Methods for calculations), thereby indicating more cells had exited the cell cycle 24 hours post-BrdU injection. (<bold>f,i,k</bold>) Introduction of the phosphodeficient (p.Thr280Ala) form of CCND2 significantly increased the number of progenitors in the P-fraction (still proliferating 24 hours post-BrdU pulse) and correspondingly decreased the exit fraction, compared to both the WT and phosphomimetic forms of CCND2. Thus, phosphodeficient CCND2 was more effective in promoting mitotic events and keeping cells in cycle.
