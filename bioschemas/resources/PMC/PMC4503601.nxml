      <abstract>
        <p>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia syndrome (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber (ROW) syndrome is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder. Two most common forms of HHT, HHT1 and HHT2, have been linked to mutations in the endoglin (<italic>ENG</italic>) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (<italic>ACVRL1</italic>or <italic>ALK1</italic>) genes respectively. This work was designed to examine the pathogenicity of 23 nucleotide variations in <italic>ACVRL1</italic> gene detected in more than 400 patients. Among them, 14 missense mutations and one intronic variant were novels, and 8 missense mutations were previously identified with questionable implication in HHT2. The functionality of missense mutations was analyzed in response to BMP9 (specific ligand of ALK1), the maturation of the protein products and their localization were analyzed by western blot and fluorescence microscopy. The splicing impairment of the intronic and of two missense mutations was examined by minigene assay. Functional analysis showed that 18 out of 22 missense mutations were defective. Splicing analysis revealed that one missense mutation (c.733A&gt;G, p.Ile245Val) affects the splicing of the harboring exon 6. Similarly, the intronic mutation outside the consensus splicing sites (c.1048+5G&gt;A in intron 7) was seen pathogenic by splicing study. Both mutations induce a frame shift creating a premature stop codon likely resulting in mRNA degradation by NMD surveillance mechanism. Our results confirm the haploinsufficiency model proposed for HHT2. The affected allele of <italic>ACVRL1</italic> induces mRNA degradation or the synthesis of a protein lacking the receptor activity. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that functional and splicing analyses together, represent two robust diagnostic tools to be used by geneticists confronted with novel or conflicted <italic>ACVRL1</italic> mutations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) (ORPHA774, MIM # 187300) also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is a vascular dysplasia syndrome, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It has an incidence of 1/8,000 persons being therefore a rare genetic disease [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The clinical symptoms characteristic of HHT are included in the CuraÃ§ao criteria [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Individuals with HHT initially present with epistaxis, telangiectases in mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal sites, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) most commonly found in pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral circulations, and familial inheritance of a first-degree [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>HHT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and has two most common forms HHT1 and HHT2 typically referring to the genes involved in each case [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Single mutations are detected in Endoglin (<italic>ENG</italic>; HHT1) (MIM # 131195) [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 (<italic>ACVRL1</italic>/ALK1; HHT2) (MIM # 601284) [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or <italic>MADH4</italic>/SMAD4 (JHPT, a combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT) [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are at least two other loci for HHT, HHT-3 and HHT-4, identified by linkage analysis mapped on chromosome 5q [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and chromosome 7p [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] respectively. A recent study revealed that mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9, <italic>BMP9</italic> gene also known as <italic>GDF2</italic> (Growth Differentiation Factor 2), cause a vascular-anomaly syndrome with phenotypic overlap with HHT [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 80% to 90% of HHT cases present mutations in <italic>ENG</italic> or <italic>ACVRL1</italic> while the remaining cases are caused by mutations in <italic>SMAD4</italic> or in the other yet unknown genes [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Over 800 different mutations in <italic>ENG</italic> and <italic>ACVRL1</italic> genes have been identified in patients with HHT1 and HHT2 respectively, pointing the wide allelic heterogeneity displayed by HHT. Among the point mutations described, missense mutations are mainly recorded (&gt;46%) in HHT2 patients. Intronic and splice defect mutations are also noted but represents 8% of all mutations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arup.utah.edu/database/HHT/">http://arup.utah.edu/database/HHT/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The protein products of <italic>ENG</italic>, <italic>ACVRL1</italic> and <italic>MADH4</italic> are receptors or signaling molecules of the TGFÎ²/BMPs pathway [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. They are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and extracellular matrix formation [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In particular, they are expressed in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that play a critical role for the proper development of the blood vessels [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <italic>ACVRL1</italic> encodes ALK1 which is a type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor and a partner for BMPR2 (type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor of the TGFÎ² pathway). <italic>ENG</italic> encodes Endoglin, a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that acts as a TGFÎ² type III receptor/co-receptor which collaborates with ALK1 to promote cell migration and proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Endoglin does not have a kinase activity but modulates ligand binding to its signaling receptors [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Most TGFÎ² family ligands bind to an heterodimeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates ALK1, one of the 7 type I receptors for TGFÎ² family members [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which in turn phosphorylates a receptor-regulated Smad protein (Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8). This phosphorylated Smad dimerizes with a common partner, Smad4, and this complex translocates to the nucleus where it induces the transcriptional activation of specific genes [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In 2007, BMP9 and BMP10 were identified as the physiological ligands for ALK1 receptor, long been considered as an orphan receptor in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Subsequently, it was established that BMP9, but not BMP10, is the only active circulating member of the TGFÎ² family present in human adult serum capable of activating ALK1 and it could play a role as a regulator of endothelial quiescence [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the present study, we analysed 23 mutations in <italic>ACVRL1</italic> gene that have been observed after the screening of more than 400 HHT patients. The discovery of BMP9 as the physiological ligand for ALK1 receptor in human serum [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] enabled Nicolas Ricard <italic>et al</italic>. to establish a diagnostic tool based on the analysis of the BMP9 response through the BRE-Luciferase reporter gene activity to discriminate pathogenic from polymorphic <italic>ACVRL1</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The first aim of the present work was to evaluate the functional significance of <italic>ACVRL1</italic> missense mutations found in our HHT2 patients in response to BMP9. Next, we aimed to elucidate <italic>in cellulo</italic> if the pathogenicity of an intronic mutation outside the standard splice sites, c.1048+5G&gt;A at intron 7, was explained by a splicing impairment using the minigene approach. In addition, one missense mutation detected in exon 6, c.733A&gt;G (p.Ile245Val), appeared functional after BMP9 stimulation while the patient is an index case. We hypothesized that this exonic substitution can disturb mRNA splicing. Minigene strategy was assessed and validated our assumption.</p>
      <p>This work, based on functional analysis in response to BMP9 and splicing analysis using minigene approach confirms that the functional haploinsufficiency of the <italic>ACVRL1</italic> gene is the main pathophysiology underlying HHT2. Furthermore, the methodological approach has proved to be a useful tool to distinguish pathogenic <italic>ACVRL1</italic> mutations.</p>

        <p>We reviewed data from 400 patients analysed in our laboratory between January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2005 and July 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014. Patients were diagnosed with HHT when they possessed at least three of the four CuraÃ§ao criteria: 1) an affected first degree family member; 2) recurrent nosebleeds; 3) multiple telangiectases along the mucocutaneous surface; and 4) AVMs in major organs [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
        <p>Mutational analysis for the 4 genes, <italic>ENG</italic>, <italic>ACVRL1</italic>, <italic>SMAD4</italic> and <italic>BMP9</italic>, were carried out after written informed consent from the patients and under research protocols according to the declaration of Helsinki. Only missense variations of uncertain significance (VUS) were studied in this work. The authors did not have any interaction with patients and they used results of genetic screening without any identifying information for the patients.</p>

        <title>Sample Preparation and Genetic Screening</title>

        <p>All probands of the present study have been diagnosed with clinical features of the HHT disorder including recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and arteriovenous malformations in lung, liver and central nervous system. Mutational analysis of the entire <italic>ACVRL1</italic> coding sequences in our group of more than 400 patients enabled us to detect several mutations. We focused our study on 23 mutations: 22 missense mutations and one intronic variant. Fourteen out of the 22 missense mutations had never been reported before in HHT2 patients and eight had been previously described with uncertain pathogenicity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arup.utah.edu/database/HHT/">http://arup.utah.edu/database/HHT/</ext-link>). Among the fourteen novel mutations, 6 were in the extracellular domain (p.Cys41Gly, p.Cys41Tyr, p.Cys46Gly, p.His66Tyr, p.Cys77Phe, and p.Glu111Asp) and 8 were localized in the intracellular kinase domain (p.Gly211Ser, p.Ile245Val, p.Leu313Val, p.Pro378Pro, p.Glu379Asp, p.Val404Gly, p.Val441Met, and p.Cys443Tyr) (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The silent nucleotide substitution (c.1134C&gt;T; p.Pro378Pro) is a novel polymorphism and it was included in this study as an internal control. One of the known mutations was found in the extracellular domain (p.Arg47Pro) and the seven remaining mutations were in the intracellular domain (p.Gly211Asp, p.Leu306Pro, p.His314Tyr, p.Pro378Ser, p.Glu379Lys, p.Arg411Trp, and p.Ile417Phe) (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

        <title>Functional assay</title>
        <p>To study the pathogenicity of our HHT2-related ALK1 mutations, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate 22 mutants reproducing either known or novel human mutations found in our patients. First, we investigated the impact of these mutations on the ALK1 receptor activity in response to BMP9, using luciferase reporter controlled by Smad 1/5-transcriptional responsive element to BMP9, pGL3 (BRE)<sub>2</sub>-luciferase [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For this, NIH3T3 cells, that do not express endogenously ALK1, were transfected with ALK1 mutants and pGL3 (BRE)<sub>2</sub>-luciferase plasmid vectors. Four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with BMP9 (50 pg/ml: EC<sub>50</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) for 15 hours. BMP9 induced a 5-fold induction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with WT-ALK1 (Figs <xref rid="pone.0132111.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0132111.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Most ALK1 novel mutants did not respond to BMP9 stimulation as shown in <xref rid="pone.0132111.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> except p.Glu111Asp, p.Ile245Val, and p.Pro378Pro which responded to BMP9 similarly to WT-ALK1 (4.9 and 4.8-fold induction). Similarly, in the series of known mutations, the addition of BMP9 stimulated the BMP Response Element (BRE) in the case of the WT-ALK1 but not with ALK1 mutants except p.Ile417Phe (4.9 fold induction) which was equal to the WT-ALK1 response (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Western blot analysis</title>
        <p>In order to verify the results of the functional assay in response to BMP9, we observed whether these mutations affect the protein maturation. HeLa cells were used to transiently express ALK1, including WT and mutant constructs. 48 hours later, cells were lysed and proteins were analyzed by western blot using anti-HA and anti-actin antibodies. Immunoblotting results showed that for the WT-ALK1, two protein bands were detected, the upper and the lower bands representing respectively the mature ALK1 protein with complex N-glycans and the precursor immature form. The WT-ALK1 has slightly intense upper band compared to the lower band. However the majority of the mutants, (p.Cys41Gly, p.Cys41Tyr, p.Cys46Gly, p.His66Tyr, p.Cys77Phe, p.Gly211Ser, p.Leu313Val, p.Glu379Asp, p.Val404Gly, p.Val441Met and p.Cys443Tyr) from the novel mutations (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) and (p.Arg47Pro, p.Gly211Asp, p.Leu306Prol, p.His314Tyr, p.Pro378Ser, p.Glu379Lys and p.Arg411Trp) among the previously described mutations (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), have a predominant lower immature band. This aspect reflects an impaired folding affecting the processing of the proteins and probably their retention in a pre-Golgi compartment. The p.Glu111Asp, p.Ile245Val, and p.Ile417Phe mutants have an aspect equivalent to WT-ALK1.</p>

        <title>Cellular localization</title>
        <p>Subsequently, to indicate if our studied missense substitutions impair the trafficking of the mutant ALK1 receptors, HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged ALK1-wild type or ALK1 mutants were labeled with the mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody and a rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody. Calnexin is a chaperone that acts to retain unfolded or unassembled N-linked glycoproteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The subcellular localization was then examined by immunofluorescence analysis under confocal laser scanning microscopy. Double labeling revealed that there was no significant co-localization of the wild-type ALK1 protein with calnexin. Wild-type ALK1 was localized predominantly on the plasma membrane with additional staining throughout the ER network, confirming that wild-type ALK1 is transported out of the ER system and is addressed to the plasma membrane. <italic>A contrario</italic>, all ALK1 mutant proteins, with the exceptions of p.Ile417Phe, p.Glu111Asp, p.Ile245Val, and p.Pro378Pro, were observed to be distributed intracellularly in a perinuclear and reticular pattern typical of the ER network in co-localization with calnexin, suggesting that expressed mutant proteins are mostly retained in the ER (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0132111.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Some mutant proteins such as p.Cys41Gly, p.Cys41Tyr, p.Leu313Val, p.Arg411Trp, and p.Val404Gly, showed a membrane additional staining but we observed that they were preferentially targeted to the ER compartment rather than transported to the cell surface (<xref rid="pone.0132111.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

        <title>Splicing analysis</title>
        <p>To determine the impact on splicing of the c.1048+5G&gt;A mutation in intron 7, we generated a minigene reporter by cloning PCR-amplified genomic exon 7 and Â± 200bp of adjacent introns into pSpliceExpress vector, using a single recombinant reaction based on the gateway system [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. After transfection in HeLa cells, the splicing products were assayed by RT-PCR to investigate the consequences of c.1048+5G&gt;A on splicing. As reported in <xref rid="pone.0132111.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, the RT-PCR shows two distinct mRNA species in either the c.1048+5G&gt;A and the WT constructs with a difference in the size of the upper band (compare lane 2 with lane 3 in <xref rid="pone.0132111.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The upper band of about 525bp in lane 2 corresponds to normally spliced mRNA product whereas the 560bp band in lane 3 represents an aberrant transcript. The lower band of 235bp was the same in both cases and represents the insulin exons, which are present in the pSpliceExpress and are constitutively spliced together in most cases to serve as an internal positive control. Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR fragments in <xref rid="pone.0132111.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, revealed that the longer transcript resulted from the retention of 35bp of the intron 7 due to the activation of a novel donor splice site, inducing a frame shift with a Premature Termination Codon (PTC) in the exon 8, predicting that the resulting mRNA is a substrate for Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD).</p>

        <p>The splicing reporter minigene approach was applied to the missense mutations that responded to BMP9 stimulation in order to uncover their molecular mechanism. We tested c.733G&gt;A (p.Ile245Val) in exon 6 and c.1249A&gt;T (p.Ile417Phe) in exon 9. The exons 6 and 9 and their â200bp flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR using specific primers. The hybrid constructs were then transfected into HeLa cells and the RT-PCR were performed. In the case of c.733A&gt;G (p.Ile245Val) (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), we observed three species of RNA compared to two products for the WT allele (compare lane 2 with lane 3). The upper band obtained with the normal exon splicing, around of 400bp, was slightly higher than the band obtained with the mutant exon and we found another band in lane 2 between the upper band and the lower band of insulin exons. Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR fragment in <xref rid="pone.0132111.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>, revealed that the short fragment resulted from the c.733A&gt;G allele having lost 40 bp from the exon 6 due to the activation of a novel acceptor splice site, inducing a frame shift with a PTC in the exon 7 predicting a substrate of NMD. Unfortunately, the middle band was impossible to sequence due to its low intensity. In the case of the c.1249A&gt;T substitution in exon 9, the bands of the RT-PCR products were the same for the WT construct as well as for the mutant construct. Two bands were observed on gel, one of 235bp corresponding to the insulin exons and one heavier band of 380bp (<xref rid="pone.0132111.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Sequencing analysis of this last band revealed that it corresponds to the complete exon 9 in both cases (sequence not represented).</p>

        <p>In summary, our results revealed that the missense mutations have mostly a critical effect on the protein structure, totally spoiling or reducing in part, the protein function. However, c.733A&gt;G, p.Ile245Val has an upstream effect and contributes to a radical inhibition of the mRNA translation by disturbing the splicing mechanism. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that an intronic mutation placed nearby the classical splice sites can deregulate the normal predicted splicing event and promote the activation of novel regulatory cis-elements. In our case, c.1048+5G&gt;A reduces the normal splicing site efficiency and therefore activates a cryptic donor splice site 35bp upstream of the 3âend of the intron 7, inducing a frame-shift with a PTC in the exon 8. Taken together, our findings suggest that the analysis of the BMP9 response and the generation of the minigene reporter constructs are two particularly useful diagnostic tools and both constitute a solid approach to discriminate pathogenic from polymorphic <italic>ACVRL1</italic> mutations.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>HHT is an autosomal dominant disease affecting approximately 1.2 million people worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This syndrome involves mainly mutations in the gene encoding Endoglin (<italic>ENG</italic>) related to HHT1, or in the gene encoding ALK1 (<italic>ACVRL1</italic>), in the case of HHT2. Patients with <italic>ENG</italic> mutations were excluded from this study. Most <italic>ENG</italic> mutations found in our laboratory were frameshift and result in a loss of the mRNA; therefore there was no doubt about their pathogenicity. However, a cellular assay was recently published in order to study the functional significance of endoglin missence mutations, based on the ability of endoglin to enhance ALK1 response to bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>For <italic>ACVRL1</italic>, a large spectrum of mutations within its locus has been identified as being responsible for HHT2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hhtmutation.org/">http://www.hhtmutation.org</ext-link>). Mutations in this gene are distributed over the entire coding sequence and can also be detected in intronic splice sites. In the present work, we report the molecular characterization of 23 selected mutations of <italic>ACVRL1</italic> gene. We performed functional and/or splicing analysis to assess the morbidity of these mutations.</p>
      <p>The functional assay in response to BMP9 was useful to evaluate the pathologic significance of the missense mutations. This functional test of the ALK1 receptors was modeled to replace the TGF-Î² response analyzed in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. BMP9 is expected to activate the canonical bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling pathway which is mediated via the ALK1/2/3/6 type I receptors that phosphorylate Smad 1, Smad 5 and Smad 8 [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These intracellular mediators are in turn able to activate BRE (BMP Responsive Element) identified in Id1 promoter [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The splicing reporter minigene is the most common technique used to analyze the regulation of an alternative splicing and it provides an avenue to study splice site selection <italic>in cellulo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In opposition to the traditional laborious construction of splicing reporter minigene using restriction enzyme digestion [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the facility of the pSpliceExpress system, permits its use in medically relevant application in our laboratory. Combinating these two techniques, we developed a strategy for routine diagnosis, in attempt to analyze a large panel of ALK1 mutants detected by genomic DNA screening. In our cohort of 400 HHT2 patients, we detected 23 mutations, 22 were of missense type and one was intronic. Out of the 22 missense mutations, 8 were already published and 14 had never been described in databases.</p>
      <p>Firstly, our functional test results discriminate 18 non-functional mutants versus 4 functional mutants (<xref rid="pone.0132111.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Performing western blot was necessary to observe the maturation of mutant proteins. We noticed a difference in the band intensity between the WT-ALK1 and the 18 defective receptors. While the mature higher band was predominant compared with the immature lower band in the case of the WT-ALK1, this band was thin compared to a large lower band in the case of ALK1 mutants and in some cases absent as for p.Cys41Gly, p.His66Tyr, and p.Cys77Phe. Western blot and functional assay results were next confirmed with immunofluorescence staining. Confocal microscopy showed clearly that the wild type ALK1 is predominantly present at the plasma membrane. ALK1-WT reveals a partial co-localization with the ER marker (calnexin) indicating that newly synthesized ALK1 is present in the ER for some time to allow its folding. In opposite, the 18 non-functional receptors were retained in the ER compartment and the others were targeted to the cell surface similarly to the WT-ALK1. Therefore, regarding the 18 pathogenic mutations, our data link the reduced mature band with the intracellular localization in accordance with defective response obtained by the functional analysis. Moreover, the co-localization of the pathological mutants with the ER resident marker (calnexin) reflects their defective trafficking and subsequently their retention in the ER by the quality control mechanism. This eventually should lead to the degradation of these misfolded proteins by the ER-Associated protein Degradation (ERAD) system contributing to the disease. This scenario is consistent with the cellular mechanism described for HHT [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To further confirm this result, the N-glycosylation assay of the immunoprecipitated proteins can be performed.</p>

      <p>Analogously, Klaus et al. found that p.Cys77Trp, was expressed, but it did not reach the cell surface properly, did not bind BMP9 and did not respond to BMP9 [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These characteristics are in line with our observations concerning p.Cys77Phe. This mutant, while it is expressed, did not reach the cell surface and did not respond to BMP9. These cysteine substitutions disrupt the fourth disulfide bridge [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The residue Arg411 is conserved in the TGF-Î² type I receptor family [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The p.Arg411Trp has been described and was found defective in response to BMP9 [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in accordance with our results. This arginine has been also described as mutated to glutamine and proline and both mutants did not respond to BMP9 indicating that this amino acid is essential for ALK1 activity [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>Concerning p.Glu111Asp, p.Ile245Val, p.Pro378Pro and p.Ile417Phe, these 4 mutations have responded to the BMP9 stimulation, were well folded as revealed by western blot, and were addressed to the plasma membrane. The substitution c.1134C&gt;T (p.Pro378Pro), is a rare polymorphism. It was found in a patient, who carries a deletion in the <italic>ACVRL1</italic> which is the cause of the disease. We have controlled that the splicing of a minigene bearing this polymorphism was identical to the one observed with the wild type construct. This silent mutation was introduced to give another positive control to the activity analysis. The patient carrying the mutation c.333G&gt;C (p.Glu111Asp) was found to also carry an <italic>ENG</italic> mutation affecting the first methionin (p.Met1Ile), which is probably the cause of the pathology. We suggest that p.Glu111Asp is unlikely to cause HHT disease but instead represents a rare polymorphism. As for the substitution c.1134C&gt;T, we controlled by minigene assay that the splicing was identical to the wild type construct. Furthermore, the p.Glu111Asp mutation was later identified in the probandâs father who showed no symptoms of HHT, then giving more evidence to our result. Moreover, very recently, we investigated the two children of this patent, both showing symptoms of HTT and both carrying the pathogenic mutation (p.Met1Ile), but only one carrying the p.Glu111Asp variation. For c.1249A&gt;T (p.Ile417Phe), the patient has a mutation in exon 2 of ENG gene (c.132_133delTA; p.Tyr44fs46Ter). The position of the point mutation at the beginning of exon 9 led us to test it by Splicing minigene and results showed no effect on mRNA maturation of exon 9. Thus, this result, added to those of the functional test and protein expression, suggests that this variant is also a rare polymorphism.</p>
      <p>Patient with c.733A&gt;G (p.Ile245Val) have no other mutations neither in <italic>ACVRL1</italic> nor <italic>ENG</italic>. Since this mutation is of missense type, it may potentially affect the protein structure impairing partially or totally the receptor activity. According to this hypothesis, we first assayed the response to BMP9 to preliminary evaluate the functional activity. Our result showed a normal activity.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the literature describes an increasing number of human diseases resulting from aberrant splice site selection [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Yet, many previous studies demonstrated that synonymous mutations and SNPs can have a strong effect on alternative splicing and disease outcome [<xref rid="pone.0132111.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132111.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Based on these advances, we hypothesized that the nucleotide mutation in exon 6, c.733G&gt;A (p.Ile245Val) could have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing. The rapid cloning of PCR products using pSpliceExpress has greatly facilitated the investigation aimed to determine such changes. Our RT-PCR data reveals that c.733A&gt;G induces the synthesis of an mRNA missing 40bp of the exon 6 compared to the normal allele, as it was predicted by bioinformatic splicing tools. This novel mRNA exhibits a PTC in the exon 7 and it will be degraded by NMD. Our results confirm that some exonic mutations are underestimated in the regulation of the pre-mRNA splicing. Conceivably, it was difficult to obtain RNA from patient to analyze the expression level of <italic>ACVRL1</italic> mutant alleles and to confirm the involvement of the NMD mechanism in the modulation of ALK1 receptor expression. The <italic>in vivo</italic> studies by an overlapping RT-PCR and sequencing of the coding region of the <italic>ACVRL1</italic> gene in probands should be performed to provide more confidence in such splicing analysis.</p>
      <p>For one patient, we found an intronic mutation in the flanking region of exon 7 of <italic>ACVRL1</italic>: c.1048+5G&gt;A. To characterize the functional significance of this point mutation, we used the reporter minigene technique to analyze a splicing defect in the exon-intron boundaries of the exon 7. RT-PCR showed that the c.1048+5G&gt;A activates a cryptic acceptor splice site, as predicted by algorithm analysis, generating a transcript including 35bp of the intron 7. This intronic inclusion induces a frameshift and a premature stop codon appears at the beginning of the exon 8, probably resulting in the pre-mRNA degradation by NMD mechanism.</p>
      <p>Our work provides molecular evidence about the pathogenicity of 23 mutations in <italic>ACVRL1</italic>. For two single cases, we demonstrated that the missense as well as the intronic mutations can have an impact on mRNA splicing rather than on the protein structure. As conclusion, our reported findings agree with the functional haploinsufficiency model of HHT2 at three levels; an aberrant splicing as the primary pathomechanism leading to NMD-mediated mRNA degradation, an ER sequestration of a misfolded mutated protein reducing the protein expression at the membrane, and an inactive receptor impaired in its enzymatic activity or its ligand affinity. Finally, the methodological approach used is this work has proved to be an useful tool for verifying the pathogenicity of <italic>ACVRL1</italic> mutations.</p>

          <p>Known mutations are represented in S1.A and S1.B and novel mutations are represented in S1.C, S1.D and S1.E. Hela cells were transiently transfected with the C-terminally HA-tagged ALK1 plasmids. Subsequently the permeabilised cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti- HA antibody and co-stained with rabbit polyclonal anti- calnexin antibody and then processed for fluorescence confocal microscopy. For 22 cases, the mutants (I417F, Q111D, I245V, and P378P) reached the cell surface similarly to the ALK1-Wt and the remaining mutant proteins (R47P, G211D, L306P, H314Y, P378S, E379K, R411W, C41G, C46G, H66Y, C77F, G211S, L313V, E379D, V404G, V441M and C443Y) co-localized with the ER marker and showed an impairment of plasma membrane localization of the ALK1 receptors. C41Y, L313V and V404G mutants can reach the plasma membrane but their localization in the ER network was predominant. Bars = 5Î¼m.</p>
