        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Recently discovered histone lysine acylation marks increase the functional diversity of nucleosomes well beyond acetylation. Here, we focus on histone butyrylation in the context of sperm cell differentiation. Specifically, we investigate the butyrylation of histone H4 lysine 5 and 8 at gene promoters where acetylation guides the binding of Brdt, a bromodomain-containing protein, thereby mediating stage-specific gene expression programs and post-meiotic chromatin reorganization. Genome-wide mapping data show that highly active Brdt-bound gene promoters systematically harbor competing histone acetylation and butyrylation marks at H4 K5 and H4Â K8. Despite acting as a direct stimulator of transcription, histone butyrylation competes with acetylation, especially at H4 K5, to prevent Brdt binding. Additionally, H4 K5K8 butyrylation also marks retarded histone removal during late spermatogenesis. Hence, alternating H4 acetylation and butyrylation, while sustaining direct gene activation and dynamic bromodomain binding, could impact the final male epigenome features.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Besides lysine acetylation, we recently identified a variety of short-chain lysine acylations in core histones, including lysine propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, crotonylation, malonylation, succinylation, and glutarylation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dai etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Xie etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Emerging data suggest that these new histone lysine acylations may have unique functions that depend not only on cell metabolism, but also on their ability to be deposited or removed by specific enzymes (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dai etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Montellier etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Rousseaux and Khochbin, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sabari etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sin etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the functional impact of differential histone acylation on chromatin recognition by specific factors has remained unexplored.</p>
      <p>This study aims to understand the functional consequences of differential histone acylation. In particular, we decided to investigate histone butyrylation, because, in contrast to the acetyl (2-carbon) and propionyl (3-carbon) groups, the butyryl (4-carbon) group restricts the binding of bromodomains (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Flynn etÂ al., 2015</xref>). More specifically, we focused our attention on histone H4 at K5 and K8, whose acetylation is required to bind the first bromodomain of Brdt, a testis-specific member of the BET protein family (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>). Our previous work showed that Brdt stimulates the transcription of certain spermatogenic-specific genes by recruiting the P-TEFb complex and by directly binding to their transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Additionally, during late spermatogenesis, Brdtâs first bromodomain is necessary for the replacement of histones by non-histone sperm-specific transition proteins (TPs) and protamines (Prms) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Given the critical role of H4K5 and H4K8 acetylation in Brdt-driven activities, we hypothesized that other mutually exclusive histone marks at these two residues might have key regulatory roles in sperm cell genome programming.</p>
      <p>Here, we identify major histone lysine butyrylation sites in cells from different species, including mouse spermatogenic cells. Using spermatogenesis as an integrated biological model system, in addition to inÂ vitro experiments and targeted proteomic approaches, we demonstrate new characteristics of active gene TSSs. Our data indicate that interchangeable acetylation and butyrylation at H4K5 and H4K8 not only stimulates transcription, but could also underlie a highly dynamic interaction of histone post-translational modification (PTM)-binding factors such as Brdt. Additional data further show that stable differential useÂ of acetylation and butyrylation could also durably affect genome organization in the maturing sperm. Altogether, these findings indicate how competition between histone acylation states could be an important epigenetic regulatory mechanism.</p>

        <title>Histone Lysine Butyrylation Is an Evolutionarily Conserved PTM</title>
        <p>To identify histone butyryllysine (Kbu) sites and study their function, we first confirmed the presence of histone Kbu by western blotting. Our data suggest that histone Kbu is an evolutionarily conserved PTM in eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). We then used mass spectrometry to identify possible Kbu sites in core histones from three species (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kim etÂ al., 2006</xref>). Kbu sites were detected in the N-terminal tails of H3 (K9, K14, K18, K23, K27, K36, K37, K79, and K122), H4 (K5, K8, K12, and K16), and H2B (K5 and K20) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional Significance of Histone Butyrylation</title>
        <p>To examine the function of Kbu in chromatin biology, we usedÂ mammalian spermatogenesis as a model system. Spermatogenic cells can be roughly classified into three major types:Â proliferative progenitor cells (spermatogonia), meiotic cells (spermatocytes), and post-meiotic haploid cells (spermatids). During differentiation, highly specific gene expression programs are activated in both meiotic and early post-meiotic cells. Large-scale genome reorganization also takes place in spermatids, where a genome-wide replacement of histones by TPs and Prms occurs in post-meiotic cells known as elongating and condensing spermatids (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Goudarzi etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Govin etÂ al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm the existence of histone butyrylation in spermatogenic cells, we identified histone Kbu sites by mass spectrometry analysis of histones from mouse testis. We detected tenÂ butyrylation sites including H4K5bu and H4K8bu (occurring separately or in combination), supporting the presence of these two histone marks in spermatogenic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). We then used highly specific anti-H4K5bu and anti-H4K8bu antibodies, along with the anti-H4K5ac and anti-H4K8ac antibodies, to investigate the stage-specific presence of these marks in spermatogenic cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that H4K5 and K8 butyrylation is enhanced in elongating spermatids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A), similar to earlier observations for histone H4K5 and H4K8 acetylation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hazzouri etÂ al., 2000</xref>).</p>
        <p>To study the dynamic changes of butyrylation versus acetylation at both H4K5 and H4K8 sites in spermatogenic cells, we examined the co-existence of H4K5ac and H4K5bu as well as that of H4K8ac and H4K8bu. In elongating spermatids, H4K5ac and H4K8ac are widely distributed, but their localization becomes biased toward the sub-acrosomal regions in later stages. In contrast, H4K5bu- and H4K8bu-containing nucleosomes are homogenously distributed in the same cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). In late elongating spermatids, while acetylated histones are removed and degraded (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Qian etÂ al., 2013</xref>), butyrylated H4 species escape this wave of acetylation-dependent histone removal, to finally disappear in condensing spermatids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Interestingly, immunoblotting experiments, using fractionated spermatogenic cells, confirmed that butyrylation persists longer than acetylation on H4K5 and K8 sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). These results highlight a bimodal histone removal process, whereby the removal of H4 K5/K8 butyrylated nucleosome occurs after that of H4 K5/K8 acetylated nucleosomes.</p>

        <title>Genome-wide Distribution of H4K5 and H4K8 Acetylation and Butyrylation</title>
        <p>Our immunofluorescence analysis showed distinctive patterns ofÂ acetylation and butyrylation at H4K5 and H4K8, with both marksÂ showing enhanced labeling in elongating spermatids, when cellular transcription dramatically decreases (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2010</xref>). This observation motivated us to study their genomic distributions and potential functions at earlier stages of spermatogenesis, when specific spermatogenic gene expression programs are activated (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dai etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Toward this goal, mouse spermatogenic cells were fractionated into spermatocytes and post-meiotic round spermatids (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dai etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>). The twoÂ pools of cells were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) using four anti-PTM-specific antibodies (anti-H4K5ac, -H4K8ac, -H4K5bu, andÂ -H4K8bu). Analysis of the genomic distribution of these marks revealed that regions surrounding gene TSSs (located upstream of TSSs and at the 5â²UTR) exhibit the highest coverage by the four PTMs in both spermatocytes and spermatids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). Further analyses showed that the four H4 PTMs are enriched at TSSs in a manner dependent on the transcriptional activity of the corresponding genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B).</p>
        <p>A critical concern in the above experiments is the possibility that histone sites subject to acetylation may be butyrylated at only low background levels, which would be misleadingly overestimated by the ChIP-seq analysis due to vastly different affinities of the antibodies used. To address this issue, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the affinities of antibodies for their respective targets. These measurements showed that all four antibodies have similar ranges of affinity (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>A). Additionally, a ChIP-qPCR approach demonstrated that the four histone marks are significantly detected at selected genomic regions (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1</xref>B and S1C). Together, these experiments confirmed that H4K5K8 butyrylation occurs at levels that largely exceed background noise.</p>
        <p>Following these control experiments, we investigated in more detail the relationship between gene expression and the co-occurrence of the four TSS-associated histone marks. Remarkably, the most active genes were found associated with all four marks at their TSS regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). In contrast, genes lacking any one of these marks at their TSS showed significantly reduced expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Other genomic elements did not show such a direct relationship between the co-existence of the four histone marks and gene expression (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further analyze the relationship between the four acylation histone marks and gene activity, we took advantage of the differences in gene expression programs between spermatocytes (meiotic cells) and the transcriptionally active haploid round spermatids (generated after meiosis). Using our ChIP-seq data from these two cell types, we divided genes into four categories according to the intensity of TSS labeling by the four H4 acylation marks, namely: (1) genes bearing none of the four marks (labeled ânoâ) and (2â4) genes bearing all four marks, either with (2) comparable (â=â), (3) higher (â&gt;â), or (4) lower (â&lt;â) peak intensities in spermatocytes compared to round spermatids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). We observed that the four groups of genes belong to different gene expression programs. Genes in category (1) are largely unexpressed, while those in category (2) exhibited no change in expression level between meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In striking contrast, genes in categories (3) and (4) exhibited differential expression in the two cell types, which was positively associated with the change in intensity of TSS labeling by the four histone marks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Additional support for a positive correlation between the presence of the four PTMs in the TSSs and gene expression is the observation that all four marks are depleted on the sex chromosomes compared to autosomes, consistent with the chromosome-wide meiotic transcriptional inactivation known to characterize sex chromosomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C). To further investigate this observation, we specifically considered the fraction of sex chromosome-linked genes that escapes meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Namekawa etÂ al., 2006</xref>). While all four PTMs wereÂ identified on a majority (73%) of TSSs associated with active autosomal genes, co-occurrence of the four PTMs was observed in only a minority (23%) of TSSs associated with sex-linked genes that are reactivated in post-meiotic cells. Hence, over three-quarters of this latter category of TSSs bear between zero and three of the four histone marks. Interestingly, most of the TSSs bearing 1â3 of the PTMs were depleted of H4K8ac, but not of H4K8bu (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C). This is consistent with other studies showing depletion of acetylation on the TSSs of sex-linked post-meiotic genes and their labeling with other acyl groups such as crotonyl (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sin etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>).</p>

        <title>Histone Butyrylation Directly Stimulates Transcription</title>
        <p>Our ChIP-seq data showed that, like acetylation, histone butyrylation is associated with high levels of gene expression, suggesting the possibility that histone butyrylation directly stimulates gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we exploited a reconstituted activator-dependent inÂ vitro transcription system. Our early studies had shown that inÂ vitro, p300 and CREB binding protein (CBP) can catalyze lysine butyrylation by transferring the butyryl group from [<sup>14</sup>C] butyryl-CoA to core histone proteins (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2007</xref>). This activity was also observed in exÂ vivo transfection experiments (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, inÂ vitro butyrylation activity was confirmed both on a reconstituted chromatin template and on histone octamers by mass spectrometry analysis. Further analysis of this inÂ vitro activity revealed that p300 efficiently butyrylates the sites of interest, H4K5 and H4K8, in histone octamers as well as in chromatin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>After confirming that p300 is a histone butyryltransferase, we used a p300- and p53-dependent inÂ vitro transcription system (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C) to test if histone butyrylation could stimulate transcription. We observed that p300-catalyzed histone butyrylation indeed directly stimulates transcription (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D). The mutationÂ of lysine residues to arginine either on H3 or H4 tails eliminated acyl-CoA-stimulated transcription, indicating that acetyl/butyryl-CoAÂ activates transcription through p300-catalyzed histone lysine acylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E). This experiment clearly demonstrates that, like acetylation, histone butyrylation can also directly stimulate gene transcriptional activity.</p>

        <title>Brdt Binds to Gene TSSs Harboring H4 K5/K8 Acetylation and Butyrylation</title>
        <p>Association of the four histone acylation marks with the TSSs of most of the highly active genes in spermatogenic cells raises the possibility that the high transcriptional activity of these genes is mediated by the binding of Brdt to the acylation marks on their TSSs. To test this hypothesis, we compared previously identified Brdt-bound TSSs (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>) with TSSs labeled with the four histone marks. This analysis showed that most of the Brdt-bound gene TSSs also bore high levels of acetylation and butyrylation marks at H4K5 and H4K8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6B). To study if Brdtâs first bromodomain (BD1) mediates this interaction, we used spermatogenic cells from mice expressing a mutated form of Brdt lacking BD1 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>). The ChIP-seq analysis showed that, in both spermatocytes and round spermatids, the deletion of BD1 considerably weakens Brdt binding to TSSs bearing the four acylation marks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A, Brdt ÎBD1). This result indicates that BD1 has a major role in targeting gene TSSs bearing H4K5K8 acetylation/butyrylation.</p>
        <p>To further characterize histone acylation at gene TSSs bound by Brdt, we considered the occurrence of the four studied H4 PTMs at TSSs as a function of Brdt-binding. Remarkably, the vast majority of Brdt-associated TSSs bore all four acylation marks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B). These observations therefore led us to question the ability of Brdt to bind H4 bearing butyrylation at either K5 or K8 or both.</p>

        <title>H4 K5 Butyrylation Inhibits Brdt Binding</title>
        <p>To test the ability of Brdtâs bromodomains to bind a butyrylated H4 tail, we first carried out an inÂ vitro binding assay using biotinylated H4 tail peptides bearing all four possible combinations of the K5ac, K5bu, K8ac, and K8bu acylation marks. We incubated the peptides with extracts from transfected Brdt-expressing Cos7 cells and performed pull-down experiments. As expected, Brdt efficiently interacts with H4 peptides that are either fully acetylated (i.e., on K5, K8, K12, and K16) or diacetylated on K5 and K8 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>A, upper). Strikingly, whereas Brdt binding was only slightly affected by the replacement of H4K8ac by H4K8bu, it was completely abolished by the substitution of H4K5ac by H4K5bu. Pull-down experiments using Brdt mutants bearing inactive bromodomains BD1 or BD2 demonstrated that Brdt binding to all the tested peptides depends on the integrity of its first bromodomain (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>A, lower). These data clearly imply that the butyrylation of H4K5 inhibits the binding of Brdt to histone H4.</p>
        <p>To validate this result, we performed the same experiment with nuclear extracts from mouse testis. Our results confirmed that butyrylation at H4K5 abolishes the binding of Brdt to H4 tails (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C, upper). As further confirmation, we repeated the pull-down assay on protein extracts from wild-type mouse testis using either fully acetylated or fully butyrylated immobilized H4 tail peptides and analyzed the bound fractions by mass spectrometry. Brdt was easily identified among the proteins affinity-isolated by the H4ac-containing peptide, but not by the H4bu-containing peptide (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>B; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>). The use of extracts from mice testes expressing the Brdt ÎBD1 mutant confirmed that the Brdt-H4 tail interactions described above are primarily mediated by the BD1 domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C, lower right). This result was further corroborated by an experiment with JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor, which abolished the binding of testis-derived Brdt to acetylated H4 and H4K5acK8bu peptides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C, lower left). Taken together, these findings establish that H4K5bu, but not H4K8bu, abolishes the interaction between Brdt and the histone H4 tail.</p>

        <title>Structural Analysis of the Effect of Butyrylation on the Brdt BD1-H4 Tail Interaction</title>
        <p>To understand the molecular basis of the inhibitory effect of H4K5 butyrylation on Brdt binding, we carried out a structural modeling analysis. In the crystal structure of Brdt-BD1 bound to H4K5acK8ac, residue K5ac is intimately recognized by BD1, whereas K8ac makes fewer contacts (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>). Modeling shows that replacing the K8 acetyl group with a butyryl group allows the additional atoms to be accommodated without compromising any of the interactions between BD1 and the peptide (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). In contrast, replacing the K5 acetyl group by a butyryl group results in a steric clash with residues in the domainâs ZA loop, implying that some structural adjustments to the model are required to accommodate the butyryl group. Comparison with the published co-crystal structure of Brd4-BD1 bound to H3K14bu indicates the type of adjustments required to accommodate H4K5bu (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Vollmuth and Geyer, 2010</xref>). Aligning the latter structure with that of the Brdt-BD1/H4K5acK8ac complex shows that H3K14bu occupies approximately the same position as K5ac (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E). However, the bulkier butyryl group results in the displacement of a water molecule within the ligand-binding pocket and causes the K14bu main-chain and side-chain atoms to be shifted relative to those of K5ac. In the context of an H4K5buK8ac peptide, such shifts would be predicted to disrupt several direct and indirect hydrogen bonds between BD1 and the peptide (see figure legend for details). Thus, the modeling approach provides a plausible structural basis for the poor affinity observed for the binding of Brdt to the H4K5buK8ac peptide compared with that to the H4K5acK8ac and H4K5acK8bu peptides.</p>

        <title>Dynamic Mixed Labeling of H4K5K8 by Acetylation and Butyrylation at Active Chromatin Sites</title>
        <p>Our pull-down and structural modeling data strongly suggest that Brdt is inhibited from binding TSS regions where histone H4 is modified by lysine butyrylation at the K5 position. This conclusion appears contradictory to the ChIP-seq data, where H4K5bu and Brdt were both associated with the same TSS regions. A hypothesis that would reconcile these observations is that acetylation and butyrylation of H4K5 exhibit a rapid turnover. Indeed, acyltransferases associated with highly active gene TSSs might feasibly drain cellular acetyl-CoA as well as butyryl-CoA toward these sites, leading to a mixture of histone H4 acetylation and butyrylation marks. To test this hypothesis, we performed inÂ vitro assays by incubating reconstituted histone octamers with purified p300 and an equimolar mixture of acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA. Histones were then analyzed by mass spectrometry to detect acetylated and/or butyrylated peptides. Our results show that p300 can use acyl-CoAs to catalyze acetylation and butyrylation at both H4K5 and H4K8 sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A), as we detected H4 peptides bearing various combinations of acetylated or butyrylated H4K5 and H4K8 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>). Encouraged by this inÂ vitro result, we then investigated whether histone H4 isolated from spermatogenic cells also contains diverse lysine acylation marks. Mass spectrometry analysis of these samples detected H4 peptides with various combinations of acetylation and butyrylation at H4K5 and H4K8.</p>
        <p>In addition, depending on cell type, the stoichiometry of H4K5bu and H4K8bu could be higher than some of the widely studied histone marks such as H3K4me3 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kulej etÂ al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>A; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>), but lower than those of H4 tail acetylation, such as that of K16, which can be as high as 20% of H4 species (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kulej etÂ al., 2015</xref>).</p>
        <p>Acetylation is known to have a high turnover rate at gene TSSsÂ (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Crump etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, due to continuous acylation by histone acetyltransferase (HATs) such as p300 and the rapid turnover of these PTMs, it is feasible that H4K5 and K8 alternate between acetylated and butyrylated states. This model is supported by the detection of various combinations of H4K5K8 acetylation and butyrylation either in inÂ vitro HAT assays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A) or inÂ vivo in spermatogenic cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). A direct consequence of such alternating histone acetylation/butyrylation would be the dynamic binding of Brdt, which would oscillate between high- and low-affinity states depending on the acylation status of H4K5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). Such dynamic histone H4 acylation could be facilitated by open nucleosomes on the corresponding gene TSSs by specific histone variants such as H2A.Lap1, a histone H2A variant capable of inducing unstable and open nucleosomes and known to associate with active gene TSSs in spermatogenic cells (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Nekrasov etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Soboleva etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, analysis of ChIP-seq data for H2A.Lap1 revealed that the four H4 PTMs are particularly enriched on H2A.Lap1-associated TSSs (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Taken together, the above results support a model whereby alternating competing histone acetylation and butyrylation underlie a dynamic interaction between the histone modifications and the cognate bromodomain.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study reports our findings regarding the interplay between histone acetylation and butyrylation on the histone H4 tail during sperm cell differentiation. We found that inÂ vitro, p300 uses available acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA sources to acylate the H4 tail at all the acceptor lysines in an indiscriminate manner. A proteomic approach also revealed the co-existence of the same combinations of H4 K5K8 acetyl and butyryl marks in different spermatogenic cell types. ChIP-seq analysis on fractionated spermatogenic cells further demonstrated that H4K5/K8 acetyl/butyryl are particularly enriched at the TSSs of the most active genes. Strikingly, however, functional and structural analysis revealed that the acylation state of H4K5 is a critical determinant of Brdt binding affinity, as Brdt binds the acetylated, but not the butyrylated state. In this context, a stable maintenance of differential acetylation and butyrylation could have important functional consequences for the genome reorganization observed during spermatogenesis. We found that, in contrast to earlier stages, in elongating spermatids, H4K5 and H4K8 acetylation and butyrylation become more markedly associated with specific regions of the genome. This could have a direct consequence on the action of Brdt in these cells. Indeed, we previously showed that in elongating spermatids, when histone hyperacetylation and a general transcriptional shut-down occur, BD1 is indispensable for the replacement of acetylated histones by TPs (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the hyperacetylated histones are known to be directly targeted for degradation by a PA200-containing specialized proteasome (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Qian etÂ al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the Brdt-bound histone population enters this pathway. Here, we show that in elongating spermatids, butyrylated histones survive this wave of acetylation-dependent histone removal and degradation. This survival is perfectly consistent with the inability of Brdt to recognize butyrylated H4. These observations suggest that a stable differential labeling of H4 by acetylation and butyrylation may control the timing of histone removal. In this context, it is also possible to speculate that nucleosomes bearing butyrylated H4 could undergo a direct histone-to-Prm replacement due to the inability of Brdt to mediate the exchange of histones by TPs. Indeed, <italic>TP1-TP2</italic> double KO cells can undergo direct histone-to-Prm replacement but, in this case, Prms are unable to tightly compact the genome (for review, see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2010</xref>)). The prediction is therefore that regions bearing butyrylated histones would evolve to a less compact structure in mature sperms than regions that are marked by acetylated histones before their removal. This regulatory mechanism could be an elegant way to introduce differences in genome compaction by Prms.</p>
      <p>Differential histone tail acylation might also play important roles in the control of somatic cell gene expression, differentiation, and genome programming. Indeed, a recent study of p300-mediated histone H3K18 crotonylation revealed that an increase in cellular levels of crotonyl-CoA favors a more efficient de novo gene activation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sabari etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Although the precise mechanism underlying the role of H3K18cr in transcription is unknown, the differential affinity of a bromodomain protein toward crotonyl versus acetyl marks could conceivably account for the observed phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Previous reports demonstrated a rapid turnover of histone acetylation on a sub-fraction of nucleosomes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Clayton etÂ al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Waterborg, 2002</xref>), overlapping with active gene TSSs (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Crump etÂ al., 2011</xref>). However, the functional implications of the short half-life of histone acetylation on active chromatin regions, especially on highly transcribed gene TSSs, have remained elusive. The results described in our present study are consistent with a rapid turnover of both acetyl and butyryl marks on the H4 tail. Given the differential affinity of Brdt BD1 for the acetylated and butyrylated forms of H4K5, a rapid alternation of acylation states at H4K5 would result in a highly dynamic interaction between Brdt and chromatin. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the generally observed rapid turnover of acetyl marks may be functionally significant because it enables rapid transitions between alternative states of lysine acylation. Such a mechanism, while maintaining histones permanently modified, would allow for a dynamic association with specific bromodomains, which might be important for sustaining successive cycles of transcription. Thus, either a change in the ratio of cellular acyl-CoAs (for instance caused by metabolic disorders; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pougovkina etÂ al., 2014</xref>) or differential activities of histone deacetylase (HDACs) in removing acyl-groups (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Rousseaux and Khochbin, 2015</xref>) could reprogram gene expression profiles.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we provide here the first demonstration that the interchangeable use of two closely related histone acylation marks at a specific site, H4K5, has important functional consequences by modulating the ability of a transcriptional regulator, Brdt, to recognize chromatin. This finding should improve our understanding of gene transcriptional regulation and its link to cell metabolism.</p>

        <p>Pan anti-Kbu antibody, anti-histone site-specific Kbu, and acetyllysine antibodies used were purchased from PTM Biolabs and anti-histone H3 and anti-histone H4 antibodies were from Abcam. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against H4K5ac and H4K8ac were a generous gift from Dr. H. Kimura. Anti-Brdt is a homemade antibody previously described (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Butyryl-CoA and acetyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The modified porcine trypsin was purchased from Promega. HPLC-grade acetonitrile, water, and ethanol were purchased from EMD Chemicals. Peptides bearing one or a few acetyl and Kbu residues were custom synthesized and were verified by HPLC and mass spectrometry. JQ1 was synthesized by Charles McKenna and Elena Ferri (University of Southern California) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Emadali etÂ al., 2013</xref>) and used as described in this reference.</p>
        <p>The antigen recognition capacities of the antibodies used in ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR were determined using SPR as described in the <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref>.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Mouse Spermatogenic Cells, ChIP, Bioinformatics, and InÂ Vitro Transcription</title>
        <p>All the experimental procedures, including immunostaining, cell fractionation, and ChIP-seq were carried out exactly as described previously (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dai etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>). ChIP-qPCR was performed following our ChIP-seq protocol, but the recovered DNA was amplified using quantitative PCR and specific primers corresponding to regions indicated in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>. <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> indicates the sequence of these primers and details of the ChIP experiments are described in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref>.</p>
        <p>Brdt pull-down assays were performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Huang etÂ al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Pivot-Pajot etÂ al., 2003</xref>). The inÂ vitro transcription assay was also previously described (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">An etÂ al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">An and Roeder, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sabari etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tang etÂ al., 2013</xref>). The bioinformatic analyses followed a pipeline similar to the one previously described (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dai etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Montellier etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Tan etÂ al., 2011</xref>) and are detailed in the <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref>.</p>

        <p>Tight Relationship between TSSs Labeled with H4K5ac, K5bu, K8ac, and K8bu Marks and Gene Transcriptional Activity</p>
        <p>(A) The transcriptional activities of genes whose TSS regions bear the indicated histone H4 modifications are shown as box plots in spermatocytes (upper) and round spermatids (lower). The absence or presence of a histone mark is represented by the numbers â0â and â1â, respectively, and the four histone marks are arranged from bottom to top as follows: H4K5ac, H4K5bu, H4K8ac, and H4K8bu. The gene transcriptional activities as a function of various combinations of the four H4 PTMs on different genomic elements are shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>.</p>
        <p>(B) The heatmaps and profiles (upper) show the peak intensities of the ChIP signal at the TSS regions of genes associated with each of the four histone marks (â0â is input; â1â is K5ac; â2â is K5bu; â3â is K8ac; and â4â is K8bu), in spermatocytes (âSpcâ), and in round spermatids (âRSâ). The genes were assigned to four groups corresponding to: (1) genes with no ChIP peaks (ânoâ), (2) genes with moderate intensity of TSS labeling by the four marks and no significant change between spermatocytes and round spermatids (=), (3) genes with variation in TSS labeling intensities by the four marks with high meiotic peak intensity and a decreased intensity in post-meiotic cells (&gt;), and (4) genes with an increased peak intensity in post-meiotic cells compared to spermatocytes (&lt;). The box plots (lower) show the expression of the corresponding genes in meiotic and in round spermatids. These data were obtained using transcriptomic data of control samples from our previous work (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Montellier etÂ al., 2013</xref>; GSE46136).</p>
        <p>(C) Total peak counts (acetyl and butyryl H4s) per million base pair for each chromosome in spermatocytes (blue bars) and round spermatids (red bars) are shown. The expected random distributions of the ChIP-seq peaks are indicated as dashed lines (upper). The right panel shows the proportion of gene TSSs harboring 0, 1â3, or 4 of the studied H4 PTMs on autosomes and on the X chromosome in round spermatids (color coded). Of the X-linked genes that escape inactivation, the majority has either no H4K5K8 acetyl/butyryl marks or harbors one to three of these PTMs. A detailed consideration of these PTMs indicates that these TSSs are nearly always depleted in H4K8ac. The list of X-linked genes that are activated in post-meiotic cells was established based on our previous detailed post-meiotic transcriptomic analysis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boussouar etÂ al., 2014</xref>).</p>

        <p>Brdt Is Preferentially Recruited to Gene TSS Regions Enriched in H4K5ac, K5bu, K8ac, and K8bu Marks</p>
        <p>(A) ChIP-seq data from chromatin immunoprecipitation of Brdt either from wild-type fractionated spermatogenic cells or the corresponding fractionated cells expressing a truncated Brdt lacking its first bromodomain (Brdt ÎBD1) were obtained and compared with ChIP-seq data from the four indicated histone H4 marks from wild-type spermatogenic cells. Seqminer software illustrates gene TSSs bound by the wild-type Brdt (Brdt wt), Brdt ÎBD1, and the occurrence of the four H4 marks on the same regions. The input corresponds to the sequencing of chromatin fragments before ChIP from wild-type cells. Exactly the same profile was obtained for the input chromatin fragments from Brdt ÎBD1 cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p>(B) Gene TSS regions were divided into two categories, either bound or unbound by Brdt, in spermatocytes (upper) or round spermatids (lower). For each category, the proportion of genes whose TSS regions are enriched with none, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the four histone PTMs are represented with the indicated colors.</p>
        <p>(C) Mouse total testis extracts were prepared from wild-type mice (upper and lower left) or mice expressing the truncation mutant Brdt ÎBD1 (lower right) and incubated with the indicated peptides, Brdt was then visualized after pull-down using an anti-Brdt antibody (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher etÂ al., 2012</xref>). In some experiments, BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 was added to the extract prior to the peptide pull-down step, as indicated. In another experiment Brdt was identified by MS/MS (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>B), and the annotated MS/MS spectra for Brdt peptides are presented in <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>.

        <p>(D and E) Modeling of Brdt-BD1 bound to H4 peptides bearing mixed butyryl and acetyl groups.</p>
        <p>(D) Hypothetical model of an H4K5acK8bu peptide bound to Brdt-BD1. The model is based on the crystal structure of the Brdt/H4K5acK8ac complex and was built by substituting the K8 acetyl group with a butyryl group. The substitution allows all contacts between BD1 and the diacetylated peptide to be preserved, while the additional atoms of the butyryl group are accommodated within the space between residues Trp49 and Leu60.</p>
        <p>(E) Comparison of the Brdt and Brd4 BD1 bromodomains bound to diacetylated and monobutyrylated peptides, respectively. The two structures were aligned via the pocket-defining BC and ZA loops. Brd4 is shown in green, and its associated water molecules and butyrylated peptide (for which only two residues are present in the crystal structure) are shown in magenta. Brdt is shown in light blue, and its water molecules and peptide ligand are shown in cyan. For clarity, most of the ZA loop is omitted. Brdt-BD1 residues 108 and 112â114 make direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone atoms of H4 residues K5ac, G6, G7, and L10. The shift in peptide backbone position required to accommodate a butyryl group on K5 would disrupt some or all of these interactions. In the Brdt-BD1/H4K5acK8ac complex, hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecule w5 play a key structural role in linking the two acetylated lysine residues to each other and to the backbone carbonyl of BD1 residue Pro50. In the structure of Brd4-BD1/H3K14Bu, w5 is displaced by 1.1Â Ã toward Pro82, while the amide nitrogen of K14Bu is displaced in the opposite direction by 1.3Â Ã. Thus, compared to the diacetylated peptide, the presence of the butyryl group disrupts a water-mediated hydrogen bond between BD1 and the peptide.</p>

        <p>(A) InÂ vitro reconstituted octamers were incubated with purified p300 in the presence of equal amounts of acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA, and the histones were subsequently analyzed by MS. The unique histone H4 peptides bearing multiple lysine modifications, which were specifically identified, are indicated along with their corresponding spectrum counts.

        <p>(B) Stoichiometry of H4K5bu and K8bu in sperm cells. The green letters indicate the inÂ vitro chemical butyrylation, and the red letters indicate the endogenous modifications. The % represents the respective ratios of the peptide bearing H4K5bu and H4K8bu (summed peak areas) over the corresponding unmodified H4 (total germ cells: TGC; spermatocytes: Spc; round spermatids: RS; and elongating/condensing spermatids: E/CS). The values of peak area were used for calculations (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S4</xref>A).</p>
        <p>(C) Model of the functional interplay between acylation marks. We propose that at active gene TSSs, p300 (and possibly other HATs) randomly use acetyl- or butyryl-CoA to modify histone tails. HDACs and histone variants, also present at dynamic chromatin regions, accelerate the turnover of these histone marks. Alternate modifications of H4K5 with acetyl and butyryl marks, while maintaining the region competent for transcription, also lead to an oscillation in Brdt binding. The co-localization of H2A.Lap1 and the four H4 PTMs at gene TSSs is shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S4</xref>B. Dynamic Brdt binding could help the pre-initiationÂ complex and RNA PolII to reassemble at TSSs and would favor successive cycles of gene transcription.</p>
