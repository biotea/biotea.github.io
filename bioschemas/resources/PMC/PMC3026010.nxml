      <abstract>
        <p>LZAP (Cdk5rap3, C53) is a putative tumor suppressor that inhibits RelA, Chk1 and Chk2 and activates p53. LZAP is lost in a portion of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and experimental loss of LZAP expression is associated with enhanced invasion, xenograft tumor growth and angiogenesis. p38 MAPK can increase or decrease proliferation and cell death depending on cellular context. LZAP has no known enzymatic activity, implying that its biological functions are likely mediated by its protein-protein interactions. To gain further insight into LZAP activities, we searched for LZAP-associated proteins (LAPs). Here we show that the LZAP binds p38, alters p38 cellular localization, and inhibits basal and cytokine-stimulated p38 activity. Expression of LZAP inhibits p38 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion while loss of LZAP enhances phosphorylation and activation with resultant phosphorylation of p38 downstream targets. Mechanistically, the ability of LZAP to alter p38 phosphorylation depended, at least partially, on the p38 phosphatase, Wip1. Expression of LZAP increased both LZAP and Wip1 binding to p38. Taken together, these data suggest that LZAP activity includes inhibition of p38 phosphorylation and activation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>LZAP (Cdk5rap3, C53) was originally identified as a binding partner of the Cdk5 activator p35 <xref rid="pone.0016427-Ching1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, but insight into LZAP activity was gained when it was found to bind the alternate reading frame protein of the INK4a gene locus, ARF (p14<sup>ARF</sup> in human and p19<sup>ARF</sup> in mice) and activate p53, both in the presence and absence of ARF, resulting in a G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of clonogenic growth <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Further, LZAP inhibits cellular transformation, xenograft tumor growth, and xenograft tumor vascularity at least partially through LZAP's ability to bind and inhibit RelA <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Evidence of a tumor suppressor-like role for LZAP was bolstered when LZAP protein levels were found to be markedly decreased in head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) where its loss inversely correlates with expression of NF-ÎºB target genes <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. LZAP also inhibits the checkpoint kinases (Chk1 and Chk2), promotes mitotic entry and, in the presence of DNA damaging agents, sensitizes to cell death <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Further exploration of LZAP regulation found that a binding partner of LZAP, RCAD/NLBP, stabilizes LZAP protein levels and loss of RCAD/NLBP results in loss of LZAP with enhanced NF-ÎºB signaling and cell invasion <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Collectively, these data are consistent with a role for LZAP in tumor suppression.</p>
      <p>p38MAPK belongs to a family of stress-activated MAPKs that responds to cellular stress and cytokines. Expression patterns suggest that p38Î± may be the primary p38 kinase in most cell types <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Activity of p38 reflects a balance between the upstream activating kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) and inactivating protein phosphatases, primarily the <underline>w</underline>ild-type p53-<underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>p</underline>hosphatase <underline>1</underline> (Wip1, PPM1D, PP2CÎ´) <xref rid="pone.0016427-Cuenda1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0016427-Takekawa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. p38 activity results in pleiotropic downstream cellular and tissue effects including: cytokine production, inflammation, cellular differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Zarubin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Bulavin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Ghatan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Given the roles of p38 as an inducer of apoptosis and inhibitor of cellular proliferation, it is ironic that elevated p38 expression has been found in many cancer types, including breast, lung, thyroid and HNSCC, and that p38 has been implicated in promoting cell survival <xref rid="pone.0016427-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Esteva1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Junttila1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Greenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Pomerance1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Given the conflicting cellular effects that can result from p38 activation, the role of p38 in human cancer as a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor likely depends on tumor and cell specific context <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe that the putative tumor suppressor LZAP bound and inhibited p38MAPK. Conversely, depletion of LZAP enhanced phosphorylation and activity of p38. LZAP did not alter p38 activating kinases (MKKs); however, LZAP increased association of p38 with Wip1 and LZAP dependent inhibition of p38 phosphorylation was at least partially dependent on Wip1. Given that LZAP inhibits p38 activity and that the role of p38 in cancers can vary from growth inhibitory to growth promoting, results presented here suggest that LZAP activities in tumors may be complex.</p>

        <title>LZAP interacts with p38 MAPK in <italic>vivo</italic>
</title>
        <p>Described LZAP activities include inhibition of cellular proliferation, inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, and enhancement of response to chemotherapeutic agents <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. LZAP expression is lost in a subset of human HNSCC and loss of LZAP in xenograft tumors enhances tumor growth and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These data suggest that LZAP may function as a tumor suppressor. Intriguingly, morpholino directed loss of LZAP expression in zebrafish resulted in cell death and developmental delay (data not shown). Combined, these data suggest that either increased or decreased LZAP levels may have detrimental effects on cell survival. To identify proteins that may contribute to biological activities of LZAP, we screened human LZAP amino acid sequence for motifs recognized by modular signaling domains using the Scansite algorithm <xref rid="pone.0016427-Obenauer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Using high stringency criteria, Scansite analyses suggested that LZAP contained motifs predicted to bind 14-3-3-zeta and the docking domain (D domain) of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016427.s001">Table S1</xref>). Because D domain-dependent interactions are essential for MAPK binding to upstream regulators and downstream mediators <xref rid="pone.0016427-Mayor1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and because p38 and LZAP have been shown to activate p53 and to interact physically or functionally with Chk1, p38 was chosen for further exploration <xref rid="pone.0016427-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>

        <p>To confirm the predicted interaction between LZAP and p38, Myc-tagged LZAP was transiently expressed singly or with Flag-tagged p38 in mammalian U2OS cells before immunoprecipitation. When co-expressed, bands corresponding to Myc-tagged LZAP and untagged LZAP were detected in p38 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lane 2, top panel). Likewise, p38 was readily detected in LZAP immuno-precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lane 4, top panel). Expressed LZAP was also detected in immunoprecipitates of endogenous p38; however, endogenous p38 could not be detected in LZAP immunoprecipitates following LZAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lanes 1 and 3, top panels). Expression of proteins was confirmed (bottom panels) and non-immune mouse IgG (middle panels) was used as a control for non-specific immunoprecipitation. To determine if endogenous p38 and LZAP associated in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation of LZAP and p38 was performed using asynchronously growing MCF7 cells, in which LZAP and p38 expression levels are relatively higher compared to U2OS cells (data not shown). p38 was detected in LZAP immunoprecipitates either with or without UV irradiation, but not in precipitates using non-immune rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 5 and 6, the arrow indicates p38). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using p38-specific antibody did not allow detection of LZAP (data not shown). These data suggest that expressed and endogenous LZAP and p38 exist in a common complex.</p>

            <p>(A) Ectopically expressed LZAP and p38 mutually co-immunoprecipitate. U20S cells were transfected with indicated plasmids directing expression of tagged LZAP or p38. Immunoprecipitates were prepared using mouse antibodies recognizing Myc (LZAP) or p38, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted by rabbit antibodies recognizing LZAP or p38. Expression of LZAP and p38 was confirmed by immunoblotting (1% of each input lysate was loaded as reference.) Pre-immune IgG was used to control for non-specific immunoprecipitation. (B) Endogenous LZAP binds endogenous p38. Lysates from untransfected MCF7 cells without or with UV irradiation (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) were immunoprecipitated using LZAP-specific rabbit antiserium or non-immune rabbit IgG, then immunoblotted with antibodies specific to p38 or LZAP as indicated. (C) LZAP co-localizes with p38 and alters p38 subcellular localization. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of Flag-p38 with or without LZAP. Cells were fixed and p38 and LZAP expression and localization determined by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-Flag monoclonal antibody and affinity-purified rabbit anti-LZAP antibody. Cytoplasmic, nuclear and peri-nuclear localization of p38 was determined by direct visualization and quantified based on at least 100 cells from at least 3 independent experiments. The shift of p38 localization from perinuclear region to nucleus was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001, using unpaired 2 tailed <italic>t</italic> test). (D) Increased p38 abundance in the nuclear following LZAP co-expression. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of Flag-p38 with or without LZAP. Whole cell, cytoplasmic and nuclear cell lysate were prepared, then immunoprecipitates from each lysate were prepared using anti-Flag M2 affinity gel, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted by rabbit p38 antibody. The levels of C23 (nucleolar protein) and Î²-actin (cytoplasmic protein) were used to monitor the quality of the fractionation and the even loading of samples (1% of each input lysate was loaded as reference.). Expression of LZAP was confirmed by immunoblotting (1% of each input lysate was loaded as reference.), endogenous LZAP could be detected after longer exposure.</p>

        <p>To determine if LZAP and p38 co-localized or altered one another's subcellular localization, immunofluorescent staining of LZAP and p38 were performed following single or combined transient expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). When expressed without p38, LZAP localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but is excluded from nucleoli as previously described (data not shown and <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). In the absence of LZAP, expressed p38 localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm with more than 60% of cells showing stronger localization to the peri-nuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, top panel arrows). LZAP localization was not altered by co-expression of p38; however, co-expression of LZAP with p38 resulted in a shift of p38 staining from predominantly peri-nuclear to predominantly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, p38 stained panels and graph, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
        <p>To confirm the observation that LZAP altered p38 subcellular localization, cellular fractionation was performed on cells expressing p38 with and without LZAP. As expected, both p38 and LZAP localized to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions; however, expression of LZAP increased the amount of p38 detected in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Fidelity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was confirmed by expression of nucleolin/C23 and Î²-actin. Combined, immunofluorescence and cellular fractionation data suggest that LZAP and p38 co-localize and that expression of LZAP increases p38 nuclear localization.</p>
        <p>To begin defining regions of LZAP required for p38 interaction, LZAP truncation mutants were co-expressed with full length p38 before co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Results following either p38 or LZAP immunoprecipitation revealed that an extended LZAP amino terminus region (Î±Î±1-303) was sufficient for binding to p38. Within the amino terminal region of LZAP, Î±Î± 1-111 was unable to bind p38, suggesting that Î±Î± 112-303 were required for this binding. A separate and non-overlapping extended carboxy terminal region of LZAP (Î±Î± 329-506) was also sufficient for p38 binding. Truncation of the extended carboxy terminal region abrogated p38 binding suggesting that Î±Î± 329-359 of LZAP are required for p38 binding; however, amino acids 329-359 of LZAP were not sufficient for binding to p38 because a central LZAP truncation containing this region (Î±Î± 201-358) failed to bind. Within the central region, an LZAP fragment containing residues 112-358 was capable of binding p38 suggesting that a critical domain for p38 binding exists between amino acids 112 and 201 of LZAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-p38 and with or without increasing amounts of Myc3-LZAP plasmid as indicated. p38 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibody and p38 phosphorylation at Thr180/Tyr182 determined by immunoblotting. Levels of p38 and LZAP in p38 immunoprecipitates were determined by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing p38 or LZAP as described <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). (B) LZAP inhibits accumulation of phosphorylated p38 in the nucleus. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of Flag-p38 with or without Myc3- LZAP. After UV irradiation (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>), cells were triply immunostained with anti-phopho-p38, anti-Flag, and anti-Myc. The fraction of p38 expressing cells with detectable phosphorylated p38 was determined by direct visualization. Expression of LZAP was associated with a significant decrease in detection of phosphorylated p38 in p38 expressing cells ((p&lt;0.0001, using unpaired 2 tailed <italic>t</italic> test). Data are derived from examination of at least 200 cells from at least three independent experiments. (C) Depletion of LZAP increases phosphorylation of p38 in U2OS cells.

Activating phosphorylation of p38 at Thr180/Tyr182 was determined in untreated cells or in cell treated with TNFÎ± or IL-1Î² by immunoblotting. Expression of LZAP and total p38 was confirmed and GAPDH was used as a loading control. (D) Depletion of the LZAP protein correlates with p38 activation. Twenty-four hours after transfection with control siRNA or siRNA targeting LZAP, U2OS cells were transfected with plasmid encoding RNAi-insensitive LZAP.

To determine if nuclear p38 was phosphorylated in the presence of LZAP, immunofluorescent staining of p38, phospho-p38, and LZAP was performed following transient expression of Flag-p38 with or without Myc-LZAP and activation of p38 using UV irradiation (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>). Consistent with our previous findings, LZAP expression increased nuclear localization of p38 as indicated by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, lower panel green). Despite its ability to increase levels of nuclear p38, LZAP strongly inhibited accumulation of nuclear phospho-p38 following UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, compare upper and lower red panels). Quantification of phospho-p38 results revealed that 48% of p38 expressing cells were positive for nuclear phospho-p38 in the absence of expressed LZAP, compared to only 11% of p38 expressing cells positive for nuclear phospho-p38 in the presence of expressed LZAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, p&lt;0.0001).

        <p>To determine if endogenous LZAP regulates p38, LZAP was depleted by siRNA and p38 phosphorylation determined. Knockdown of LZAP in U2OS cells did not alter p38 expression; however, loss of LZAP was associated with increased levels of phospho-p38 levels in either the presence or absence of activating cytokines, TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

To begin exploring potential mechanisms of LZAP activity toward p38, the effect of LZAP loss on MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylation was determined. LZAP knockdown was not associated with increased phosphorylation of upstream p38 kinases, MKK3 or MKK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Based on loss of expression in human HNSCC and cellular effects associated with loss of LZAP such as enhanced invasion, anchorage independent growth, angiogenesis, and growth of xenograft tumors, LZAP has been identified as a putative tumor suppressor <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. LZAP contains no enzymatic motifs suggesting that its activities may be derived through protein-protein interactions. A remarkable number of molecules that are implicated in tumorigenesis (e.g. ARF, RelA, Chk1, Chk2, and as described here p38) have been found to bind to LZAP suggesting that LZAP activity may be protean <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although identification of binding partners has provided insight into LZAP function, satisfying mechanisms of pleiotropic LZAP activities have been lacking.</p>
      <p>Here we report that LZAP bound to the stress activated protein kinase p38, altered p38 subcellular localization and inhibited p38 phosphorylation and activity. Mechanistically, our data suggest that LZAP inhibition of p38 phosphorylation depends on the Wip1 phosphatase, and that in the presence of LZAP, more Wip1 is associated with p38. Conceivably, LZAP may sequester p38 in the nucleus in a complex with Wip1 as a means of p38 inactivation. Alternatively, unphosphorylated nuclear p38 may have unknown activities or may be sequestered in the nucleus so that upon loss of LZAP, rapid activation of p38 could occur through phosphorylation by nuclear kinases.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, LZAP was found to bind p38 through two independent and non-overlapping domains, an amino-terminal region (Î±Î± 1-303), and a carboxy-terminal region (Î±Î± 329-506) of LZAP. Based on gel filtration, LZAP has been reported to exist in large molecular weight complexes and the pattern of independent regions of LZAP binding to its partners, as we observed, has been reported and may be critical for formation of large protein complexes containing LZAP <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is possible that physical association between independent regions of LZAP and its binding partners are integral to LZAP function; however, we and others have found that LZAP can bind to itself suggesting that dimerization or oligomerization of LZAP could explain detection of multiple independent binding sites within LZAP (data not shown and <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mechanism of LZAP activity toward the growing list of LZAP-associated proteins (LAPs) is not well understood. LZAP has no described enzymatic activity, suggesting that LZAP may exert its effects through association with other proteins. The finding that a portion of LZAP exists in large molecular weight complexes combined with a potential for LZAP to oligomerize lends credence to this argument and further suggests that LZAP may serve to bring together effector proteins. A large portion of LZAP interacting proteins are phosphorylated, and LZAP expression has been associated with decreased phosphorylation of these proteins. These observations led us to explore if LZAP had activity to inhibit p38 upstream kinases or to activate p38 phosphatases. We found that LZAP did not alter kinase activity, as measured by phosphorylation, of MKK3 or MKK6; however, LZAP was found to increase association of p38 with its direct phosphatase Wip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016427-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). It is unclear if regulation of phosphatases is a general mechanism of LZAP activity, but it is clear that it is not a universal mechanism since phosphorylation has not been described to play a role in LZAP-mediated ARF activity. It is intriguing that additional described LAPs including RelA, Chk1 and Chk2 are also targets of phosphatases, including Wip1 <xref rid="pone.0016427-Lu2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Chew1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Fujimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We have previously shown that LZAP activates p53 in the absence of ARF raising the possibility that this ARF-independent activity of LZAP may also depend on Wip1 <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Depending on cellular context, p38 can mediate opposing cellular responses as an inducer or inhibitor of proliferation and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. To date, most data highlights LZAP as a tumor suppressor <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Jiang2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016427-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, but its role as a p38 regulator imply that LZAP could also have opposing cellular effects or that LZAP inhibition of p38 could be restricted to circumstances where inhibition of p38 suppresses tumor promoting activity.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
        <p>Cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in growth media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cell lines were obtained from ATCC or collaborators and have been passed in the Yarbrough lab with biannual authentication of identity based on microsatellite analyses of 3 markers (D7S1482A, Mycl1A and DXS981C). Plasmids were transfected using FuGene6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA in any single experiment was kept constant by adding control vector (pcDNA3). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected at 20 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Control siRNA duplex (nontargeting #1) was purchased from Dharmacon (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). The LZAP siRNA-2 was previously described <xref rid="pone.0016427-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> with on-TARGETplus modification, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-CAAGGTATGTGGACCGAGT</named-content> (sense strand); the sequence of Wip1 siRNA is: <named-content content-type="gene">5â²- GGCUUUCUCGCUUGUCACC</named-content> dTdT <xref rid="pone.0016427-Lu3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> purchased from Dharmacon.</p>
