      <abstract>
        <p>The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a RNA-binding protein proposed to post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of genes important for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. We previously demonstrated that FMRP binds to its own <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA via a guanine-quartet (G-quartet) RNA motif. However, the functional effect of this binding on <italic>FMR1</italic> expression was not established. In this work, we characterized the FMRP binding site (FBS) within the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA by a site directed mutagenesis approach and we investigated its importance for <italic>FMR1</italic> expression. We show that the FBS in the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA adopts two alternative G-quartet structures to which FMRP can equally bind. While FMRP binding to mRNAs is generally proposed to induce translational regulation, we found that mutations in the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA suppressing binding to FMRP do not affect its translation in cellular models. We show instead that the FBS is a potent exonic splicing enhancer in a minigene system. Furthermore, <italic>FMR1</italic> alternative splicing is affected by the intracellular level of FMRP. These data suggest that the G-quartet motif present in the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA can act as a control element of its alternative splicing in a negative autoregulatory loop.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The most frequent cause of inherited mental retardation, fragile X syndrome, is caused by the absence of the RNA-binding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMRP). In neurons, FMRP is associated with a limited subset of brain mRNAs together with other proteins within large ribonucleoparticles, the composition of which is still incompletely known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1â3</xref>). Within these mRNPs, FMRP is proposed to act as a regulator of translation or transport of specific target mRNAs. However, the molecular mechanisms of FMRP action on specific target mRNAs are still poorly understood. As a clue to the function of FMRP, the study of its mRNA targets appears an essential step. The guanine-quartet (G-quartet) structural motif was identified as a high affinity determinant of the interaction of FMRP with mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). RNA G-quartet is not the only proposed target of FMRP since U-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), a kissing-loop motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and the BC-1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) were also found to mediate the interaction of FMRP with mRNAs. However, FMRP target mRNAs bearing the kissing-loop motif have not yet been identified and the interaction mediated via BC1 is under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, at present, G-quartet still appears as a main consensus motif found in mRNAs of mammalian genes found associated with FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and/or demonstrated to be affected by the absence of FMRP. Genes carrying potential or verified G-quartets include the microtubule associated protein 1B <italic>MAP1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), the post-synaptic density protein <italic>PSD95</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (<italic>PP2Ac</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), or the amyloid precursor protein <italic>APP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), all important for neuronal development and synapse plasticity. However, the role of the FMRP/G-quartet interaction remains unclear as no direct evidence of its effect on post transcriptional control has been provided up to now and recent work indicated that the association of FMRP with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) would not be mediated by G-quartets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>To address these questions, we analyzed in this work the interaction between FMRP and its own mRNA, <italic>FMR1</italic>, one of the best characterized targets of FMRP where the G-quartet motif had been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Because the interaction between FMRP and its own mRNA was suggestive of an autoregulatory loop, we tested whether FMRP could control its own expression. To determine the function of the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA/FMRP interaction, we performed mutations within the G-quartet motif of the FMRP binding site (FBS) of <italic>FMR1</italic>, which abolished FMRP binding <italic>in vitro</italic> without changing the amino acid sequence of the protein and we examined at which level the FMRP/FBS interaction could play a role. Our data provide several lines of evidence for a role of the FBS and its binding to FMRP in alternative splicing regulation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene.</p>

        <title>The FBS contains two independent G-quartet structures stabilized by adenines</title>
        <p>FMRP specifically binds to its own mRNA both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The binding site of FMRP on its mRNA, here called the FBS, consists of a G-quartet motif present in the C-terminal coding region of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The G-quartet motif is formed by the stacking of several guanine tetrad units. Adenines were also suspected to contribute to the structure in the FBS by forming intercalating adenine quartets. To investigate the function of the interaction between FMRP and its own mRNA, we constructed a series of mutants to inhibit FMRP/FBS interaction by disrupting the G-quartet structures. Previous work had suggested the presence of two distinct G-quartet structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To test this hypothesis, two sets of mutations were constructed to disrupt either one or both potential structures, called ÎG1 and ÎG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In a first step, mutations were essentially substitutions of As to Cs and Us at the wobble position of codons to preserve the encoded FMRP protein sequence and to test the contribution of adenines. The presence of G-quartets in the RNAs was indicated by the presence of potassium-dependent stops of reverse transcription as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). ÎG1 mutation, located around position 1613, suppressed the 1613 (G1) stop while the stop at position 1647 (G2) remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Conversely, ÎG2 mutations had the opposite effect, with the 1613 stop unchanged and the stop 1647 suppressed. These results indicate that two independent G-quartet structures exist in the FBS. Moreover, because the mutations left the guanine content of the FBS essentially unchanged while substituting several adenines, our results support a role for the adenines in stabilizing both FBS G-quartets. This stabilization effect can be explained by the formation of A-tetrads stacking within the G-quartet structure as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). When both sets of mutations were combined in mutant ÎG(1 + 2), the stop at position 1647 reappeared while the stop at position 1613 remained absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The reappearance of a G-quartet structure at G2 position within the ÎG(1 + 2) RNA despite the presence of mutations ÎG2 could be explained by the fact that the double mutant generated a different and more stable G-quartet structure because the G-content was essentially not affected by the mutations.

        <title>FMRP binding to its own mRNA has no impact on <italic>FMR1</italic> translation</title>
        <p>We tested next the ability of these different mutant RNAs to interact with FMRP by gel shift assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The mutant RNAs (ÎG1 and ÎG2) bound to FMRP with the same affinity as for the Wt FBS (data not shown). This indicated that FMRP equally binds one or the other structure. To completely disrupt G-quartet formation within FBS, a new set of mutations, consisting essentially of A to C substitutions at the wobble position of codons and favoring hairpin structures, was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The mutations were inserted in full length <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA and the disruption of the G-quartet structure was confirmed by reverse transcriptase (RT) elongation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We have shown previously that a 425-long RNA fragment (N19) of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA containing the FBS recapitulated a Wt-binding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To confirm the loss of interaction of FMRP on ÎG4-FBS, the mutations were inserted also in the N19 fragment (N19-ÎG4) and its interaction with FMRP was tested using gel shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The binding efficiency of N19-ÎG4 RNA was found to be decreased by more than a 100-fold compared with Wt N19 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). This level of interaction, in the micromolar range, was assigned to nonspecific binding as previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

In these cells no difference in FMRP protein level could be detected between the cells expressing Wt or ÎG4 <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Also, no difference could be detected between Wt and mutant <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Furthermore, although mRNAs bearing G-quartets had been reported to be differently associated with polyribosomes in the absence of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), we could not detect a change in the association of ÎG4-<italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA with polysomes both in HeLa and in <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C).

        <title>The FBS is a potent exonic splicing enhancer</title>
        <p>A number of facts brought us to examine next a potential implication of the FBS in splicing. Firstly, the FBS is located nearby to alternatively spliced sites of <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Secondly, because of its high purine content, the sequence of the FBS has analogies to an ESE consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Third, because of its shuttling activity, FMRP has been proposed to bind mRNAs already in the nucleus and therefore should be able to interact with pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

        <p>The ability of the FBS to act as an ESE in vivo was tested by using the SXN13 minigene system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) derived from the <italic>Î²-globin</italic> gene and composed of four exons, one of which (exon 2) being alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The presence in exon 2 of a sequence with ESE properties (12MU3) induced exon 2 inclusion and resulted in a longer mRNA product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and E). A fragment of the FBS still able to form a G-quartet structure or its corresponding ÎG4 mutant was inserted within the second exon of the minigene to determine its ESE properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). After transient transfection in HeLa cells of the plasmids bearing the different minigene constructions, RT elongation was directly performed on the total RNA extracted from the cells using a 5â² end <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide priming within exon 3 of the minigene. The ESE properties of the FBS fragment were evaluated by measuring the ratio between the long RT product (bearing exon 2) and the short RT product (without exon 2) of the alternative splicing of the globin minigene. While the 12MU3 sequence was capable to specify exon 2 inclusion in about 80% of the splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E), the G4-FBS fragment induced a complete inclusion of the exon 2. Meanwhile, exon 2 was totally excised in ÎG4-FBS mutant. These data indicated that the FBS had potent exonic splicing enhancing properties on a minigene and these properties were linked to its ability to form a G-quartet structure.</p>

        <title>The overexpression of one FMRP isoform alters <italic>FMR1</italic> alternative splicing pattern in PC12 cells</title>
        <p>The fact that the FBS had a potent ESE activity in a minigene suggested that FMRP could regulate its own splicing by binding to FBS. To verify this hypothesis, we first tested whether the splicing efficiency of a globin minigene bearing the FBS fragment could be influenced by FMRP. Splicing of SXN13-G4-FBS minigene was analyzed in <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In these cells, the expression of either FMRP major cytoplasmic isoform 7 or nuclear isoform 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) by transient or stable transfection, had no detectable influence on SXN13-G4-FBS expression (data not shown). An absence of effect of FMRP on the minigene system could be due to the fact that the FBS was out of its natural context or had a too strong ESE effect on minigene splicing.</p>
        <p>We then tested the influence of an overexpression of FMRP on <italic>FMR1</italic> pre-mRNA splicing. The FBS is located close to two alternative splice sites within exon 15 of <italic>FMR1</italic>. The 3â² side of the FBS is located 110, 74 or 35 nucleotides downstream of the three different acceptor 5â² ends of exon 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The alternative splicing occurring at these three sites leads to six types of exon 15 variants, depending whether exon 14 is skipped or not. These three acceptor sites are used in different proportions in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) suggesting the possibility of regulation at this level. Because the FBS is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) we tested the possible impact of FMRP/FBS interaction in rat cells. Rat phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells stably transfected with a tagged human isoform 1 FMRP (iso-1h) under the control of the inducible promoter Tet-On were used (PC12-1â² cells). We tested in these cells, the effect of iso-1h FMRP increase on endogenous (rat) <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA alternate splicing. Upon induction of iso-1h expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) by doxycyclin treatment of the cells, the total amount of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNAs (rat + human) was found increased over 30-fold compared to its basal level in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B left). Meanwhile, the global level of endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNAs (rat) was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B right). The splicing events taking place around the FBS site within the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> were analyzed by qRTâPCR using rat specific primer sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Our data showed that the products of exon 15 first acceptor site usage (including the longest isoform 1, the most frequent isoform 7 and isoforms 13 and 17) were decreased over 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). This decrease was concomitant with an increase in minor isoforms, products of exon 15 second and third acceptor site usage (1.4- and 1.8-fold respectively), including the minor isoforms 2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18 and 19. Thus, the overexpression of the full-length FMRP isoform alters <italic>FMR1</italic> splicing events around the FBS in a manner that indicates a displacement of the equilibrium between major and minor isoforms. These data are in agreement with the hypothesis that FMRP binding to the FBS plays a role in regulating <italic>FMR1</italic> splicing.

        <p>We examined also the splicing events leading to exon 14 skipping. Upon overexpression of the full-length FMRP, all transcripts lacking exon 14 were found decreased by 2-fold. Although the splicing events leading to exon 14 skipping are likely in relationship with those occurring between exons 14 and 15, they are quite rare events compared with the latter [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and our data not shown]. To confirm the alterations of <italic>FMR1</italic> expression seen at the RNA level upon iso-1h overexpression, we analyzed FMRP isoform expression by western blotting after 2D PAGE. The use of monoclonal anti-FMRP 1C3 antibody (recognizing an N-terminal epitope) indeed revealed significant differences in FMRP isoforms upon iso-1h overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). The identification of each protein spot is however extremely difficult due to the complexity of splice products. The highest product visible only in iso-1h expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, right, spot a) could correspond to the exogenous iso-1h transferred inefficiently due to its higher molecular weight. Spots b and d, which showed a broadening in the PC12-1â² cells compared to PC12, likely contained several isoform species of similar molecular weight. The origin of spot c, which appeared in PC12-1â² cells was unknown. Most remarkable is the decrease of spot f, which could correspond to the shortest FMRP isoforms 10 and 11 (48 and 47 kDa respectively) that were found decreased at mRNA level. Altogether, these data showed that an overexpression of one FMRP isoform was able to alter <italic>FMR1</italic> alternative splicing pattern both at RNA and protein level.</p>

        <p>Following the observation that an overexpression of FMRP in cells leads to an alteration of its splicing at exon 15, we tested next whether the absence of FMRP could lead to similar defects. Thus, we analyzed the splicing pattern of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNAs in Wt and <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice where FMRP protein is absent but <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA is still expressed. <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice have been produced by the insertion of a neomycin cassette within exon 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The exon 15 splicing events were analyzed by RTâPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) on total RNA extracted from cortices of 10-days old Wt and <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice as well as in the synaptoneurosomal fractions (SN) of these extracts where FMRP function is considered to be prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In parallel, RT-PCRs were also performed on another part of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA (exon 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D) and on <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E) for normalization. As previously reported, while FMRP protein expression was abolished in <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA remained expressed, although reduced to about 65% of Wt level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and 7D, compare lanes 3 to 4 and 5 to 6), possibly due to NMD events. RTâPCR performed across exon 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) revealed three bands corresponding to the three isoforms produced by the alternative branching of exon 14 and exon 15. Not surprisingly the isoforms lacking exon 14 are not detected in these PCR conditions because they are much less frequent events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Comparison of Wt and <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> exon 15 RT-PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) revealed a marked difference concerning the smaller products that correspond to minor spliced mRNAs variants. Thus, these exon 15 minor splices disappeared in <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>, both in total cortical extracts and in SN fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A lanes 4 and 6). These data indicate that FMRP absence alters the splicing pattern of <italic>FMR1</italic> exon 15 in the cortex. While an overexpression of FMRP led to an increase of exon 15 minor splices, the absence of FMRP had the opposite effect. Altogether these data support a role for FMRP in the control of its own splicing at exon 15.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this work, we analyzed the functional impact of the interaction between FMRP, the protein absent in the fragile X syndrome and the binding site identified in its own mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the FBS is located within the region encoding the RGG domain of FMRP. One main structural feature of this site is its ability to adopt a guanine quadruplex or G-quartet motif. We showed here that the structure of the FBS was more complex than initially thought. Thus, we identified two independent G-quartet structures in the FBS. Mutations that abolished either one or the other structure (mutant ÎG1 and ÎG2) had no impact on FMRP binding efficiency in the context of a 425-nt long fragment (N19), indicating that FMRP can indistinctly bind to either one or the other structure. Furthermore, we showed that several adenines of the FBS play a role in the differential stability of the G-quartet structures, supporting the initial hypothesis that the structure involves intercalating adenine quartets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and as already observed for other G-quartet structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Substitution of these adenines by pyrimidines does not however prevent formation of a G-quartet structure within the FBS and does not affect binding to FMRP <italic>in vitro</italic>. The elimination of both structures (mutant ÎG4), while keeping the encoded protein sequence unchanged, dramatically reduced FMRP binding to a non specific level and confirmed the absolute requirement for a G-quartet for efficient binding. We then tested the impact of mutation ÎG4 within the context of full <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA in cells. Surprisingly, no effect of G-quartet absence could be detected neither on mRNA translation and localization nor on polyribosomes association in HeLa cells. Thus, these observations do not support a role in a translationally controlled autoregulatory loop of the binding of FMRP to its own mRNA as initially proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The fact that the FBS site is purine-rich and localizes close to alternative splicing sites was suggestive of its potential function as a splicing regulator of <italic>FMR1</italic>. Indeed, mammalian ESEs were identified initially as purine-rich sequences that associate with specific SR-family proteins and promote the utilization of adjacent splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). When a fragment of the FBS that retained its ability to form a G-quartet was tested in a minigene system, a strong exonic splicing enhancer activity was observed. This activity was completely abolished in a mutant that had lost its ability to form the G-quartet although it kept a G-rich sequence (ÎG4). Thus, our data indicate that the FBS is a potent ESE and interestingly, the ESE activity of FBS seems to rely on its ability to adopt a G-quartet structure. These data suggest that the FBS may be a control element of <italic>FMR1</italic> alternative splicing and the binding of FMRP could play a role in the control. Indeed, we showed that the equilibrium between short and long FMRP isoforms produced by exon 15 alternative splicing is altered by manipulating the level of FMRP protein (either by overexpression of the longest isoform 1 or in <italic>FMR1</italic> KO cells where the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA is still expressed). This supports the idea that FMRP binding to the FBS site controls the ratio between the different isoforms in an autoregulatory loop. The binding of FMRP longest isoform 1 on the FBS could counteract or modulate its ESE function (for instance by interfering with SR proteins) such as to favor the minor site inclusion. The two alternative G-quartet structures are equidistant (39 and 36 nt respectively) from the two alternative splicing sites in exon 15, suggesting that they could act as a molecular switch for controlling exon 15 alternative splicing. However, one cannot exclude at present that the observed effect of FMRP on the alternative splicing of its own mRNA may be indirect, involving for instance the translational control by FMRP of splicing factors.</p>
      <p>The biological significance of a modulation of FMR1 alternative splicing is presently unclear in particular because it is not known whether the different isoforms of FMRP, some of which being present in very low amount, have different functions. Still a variation in their ratio is likely to have implication for the function of FMRP. For instance, the isoforms lacking the 5â² end of exon 15 produced by the alternative splicing at second and third acceptor sites both lack serine 499, the major known phosphorylation site of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This phosphorylation site was shown to modulate FMRP association to mRNAs in drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and to affect translation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Based on our observations, increased FMRP binding to FBS would result in a decrease in the synthesis of FMRP major isoforms (carrying a complete exon 15) together with an increase of minor isoforms (lacking serine 499) downregulating FMRP function in a negative autoregulatory loop.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, while we could not show a translational effect of FMRP binding to its own <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, our data support the implication of the FMRP/G-quartet interaction on the regulation of FMRP alternative splicing around exon 15. The fact that perturbations of the intracellular level of FMRP leads to modulation of exon 15 isoforms expression in a way susceptible to alter their RNA-binding properties suggests the existence of a possible autoregulatory loop. Our data suggest also that FMRP might be involved in splicing regulation of other genes containing G-quartet motifs in their protein coding sequence. This should be particularly prominent in neurons where FMRP is expressed at its highest level and even locally in dendrites where FMRP is present and splicing has been proposed to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p>
