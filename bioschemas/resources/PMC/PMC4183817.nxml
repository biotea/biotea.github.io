        <p>Single Î±-helix (SAH) domains are rich in charged residues (Arg, Lys, and Glu) and stable in solution over a wide range of pH and salt concentrations. They are found in many different proteins where they bridge two functional domains. To test the idea that their high stability might enable these proteins to resist unfolding along their length, the properties and unfolding behavior of the predicted SAH domain from myosin-10 were characterized. The expressed and purified SAH domain was highly helical, melted non-cooperatively, and was monomeric as shown by circular dichroism and mass spectrometry as expected for a SAH domain. Single molecule force spectroscopy experiments showed that the SAH domain unfolded at very low forces (&lt;30 pN) without a characteristic unfolding peak. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the SAH domain unfolds progressively as the length is increased and refolds progressively as the length is reduced. This enables the SAH domain to act as a constant force spring in the mechanically dynamic environment of the cell.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stable single Î±-helix (SAH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> domains are found in proteins from organisms ranging from bacteria to humans and are present in â¼100 proteins in the human genome (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). They are unusual in that they have a relatively high thermal stability and are stable over a wide range of salt and pH conditions without neighboring interactions. They are characterized by a high number of arginine, lysine, and glutamic acid (Arg, Lys, and Glu) residues, and their stability is predicted to arise from the (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>i</italic> Â± 4) and (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>i</italic> Â± 3) intrahelical interactions between either Arg and Glu or Lys and Glu through the formation of stabilizing salt bridges (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The unusual stability of these domains contrasts with that of most Î±-helices, which are stabilized by interactions with neighboring secondary structure elements (<italic>e.g.</italic> in globular proteins, bundles, and coiled coils).</p><p>Despite their abundance, the functions and properties of SAH domains remain unclear. SAH domains appear to be fairly rigid and resistant to bending as demonstrated by a combination of optical trap, small angle x-ray scattering measurements, and modeling (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This suggests that they could function as rigid spacers between protein domains as SAH domains commonly bridge two functional domains (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, it is unclear how the sequence and structure of SAH domains are linked to their physical, dynamic, and mechanical properties. Gaining an understanding of the properties of SAH domains is thus key to elucidating their cellular roles.</p><p>The biological function of SAH domains is likely to be determined by how rigid and inextensible they are over their length. Therefore, it is important to determine how well the SAH domains maintain their highly helical structure over a long length of sequence. For example, do they act as a stiff spacer or as a weak extensible element that unfolds at low forces before other regions of the protein unfold? To answer these questions, we characterized a predicted 97-residue-long SAH domain from myosin-10 using a combination of approaches. We determined the secondary structure of the peptide and its thermal melting characteristics by circular dichroism and confirmed that it was monomeric by mass spectrometry. We used single molecule atomic force spectroscopy to determine its unfolding properties, and we used molecular simulation to understand the physical properties that underlie its unique structural features. These results provide novel insight into the properties of the SAH domain and suggest new ideas about its biological role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Constructs for Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy</title><p>PCR was used to amplify the sequence for the SAH domain used in these experiments using bovine myosin-10 cDNA as a template (a kind gift from Richard Cheney; UniProt accession number P79114; residues 813â909).

A tryptophan residue was added to the C terminus to enable <italic>A</italic><sub>280</sub> concentration measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Constructs for AFM Experiments</title><p>A modified pET3 vector encoding a pentamer of titin I27 domains (His tag-I27-I27-I27-I27-I27-Cys-Cys) was a kind gift from Dr. David Brockwell, University of Leeds (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To generate the I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>1</sub> construct, the SAH domain was cloned between the second and third I27 domains.

Data were collected every 1 nm with 30-s averaging time with each measurement being an average of two repeated scans. Data presented are averaged from at least three separate measurements of different protein preparations. Thermal measurements were performed in a temperature range from 10 to 85 Â°C with 0.7 Â°C/min heating rate with data acquisition every 1 Â°C and a 20-s averaging time. The sample cooling rate prior to measurement of refolded protein was â¼ 2 Â°C/min.</p><p>To obtain spectra for SAH domains present in the pentameric titin I27 construct, measurements of I27<sub>5</sub>, I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>1</sub>, and I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> at the same molar concentration were performed. The spectrum (millidegrees) of the âemptyâ I27<sub>5</sub> construct was subtracted from those of I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>1</sub> and I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> constructs. The mean residue molar ellipticity of proteins was calculated as described (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).

Experiments were performed either directly in this solution or after replacement with Tris buffer.</p><p>All AFM work was carried out on an Asylum Research MFP-3D instrument operated at room temperature. Cantilevers (MLCT, Bruker) were calibrated prior to collection of force-extension traces using the thermal noise method (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); spring constant values (<italic>k</italic><sub>c</sub>) were typically 35â45 pN/nm. Force-extension traces were collected at a velocity of 1000 nm/s over a distance of 500â1000 nm with a sampling rate of 5 kHz and a maximum loading force of â¼1.5â3 nN. The position of the tip on the substrate was manually changed every few hundred traces.</p><p>To ensure that we only analyzed force-extension traces from a <italic>single protein molecule</italic>, which had been picked up by its N terminus, only traces where five I27 domains were seen to unfold followed by a detachment peak were used. Traces with multiple detachment peaks or where the contour length up to the detachment peak was unphysical (&gt;40 nm more than the fully unfolded length of the construct to allow for errors in origin placement) were excluded. Furthermore, only those traces showing a reasonable fit to a wormlike chain (WLC) model were used. The WLC model links force (<italic>F</italic>) to extension (<italic>x</italic>) and is commonly used to describe the elasticity of single polypeptide chains (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It has two variable parameters, <italic>p</italic>, the persistence length (a measure of stiffness) and <italic>l<sub>c</sub></italic>, the contour length (the length the polymer approaches at high force). Using an initial global fit to the five I27 unfolding events, only those traces showing an increase of contour length (<italic>l<sub>c</sub></italic>) on unfolding titin I27 domains of 28 Â± 1 nm and a persistence length (<italic>p</italic>) of 0.4 Â± 0.1 nm (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) were used. Model-free values of peak force (unfolding force (<italic>F<sub>u</sub></italic>)) and the peak-to-peak distance (P2P) were recorded. WLC parameters for a fit up to 100 pN on the first I27 unfolding peak were also recorded. The fit was limited to 100 pN to avoid the onset of the âhumpâ feature due to I27 unfolding intermediates (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The total unfolded lengths of the three different constructs prior to unfolding of the first I27 domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, predicted <italic>l</italic><sub>c</sub>) were calculated from the expected length of unfolded SAH domains and any linker sequences between I27 and SAH domains present in each construct, using 0.38 nm/residue for an unfolded peptide residue (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), together with the length of the folded I27 domains (4.5 nm).</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation</title><p>The implicit solvent model FACTS (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) was used in conjunction with the united atom CHARMM19 force field for simulations. All simulations were performed at 300 K with Langevin dynamics and a friction coefficient of 3 ps<sup>â1</sup> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The N and C termini of the SAH domain and Ala<sub>97</sub> and Gly<sub>97</sub> sequences were capped with acetyl and methylamine groups, respectively (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The termini of the Î²-sheet-rich titin I27 domain, taken from the Protein Data Bank structure <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1TIT">1TIT</ext-link>, were uncapped.</p><p>An implicit solvent approach was used to characterize the mechanical properties of SAH domains over longer periods of time; their size would make explicit solvation unviable. Although other implicit solvation approaches based on the generalized Born approximation (<italic>e.g.</italic> solvent-accessible surface area and EEF1) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) showed that SAH domains form highly stable helices, only with FACTS did we observe reversible helix formation for short SAH-like sequences (10â12 residues long).</p><p>Starting structures for zero force simulations were prepared by performing a steepest descent minimization (1000 steps) from artificially generated perfectly Î±-helical conformers of myosin-10 SAH domain, Ala<sub>97</sub>, and Gly<sub>97</sub> or from the Protein Data Bank structure in the case of I27 followed by a short (100-ps) dynamics run. Perfectly Î±-helical conformers were created by setting internal dihedral angles to Ï = â47Â° and Ï = â57Â°. Zero force simulations lasted at least 100 ns.</p><p>Constant velocity force spectroscopy experiments were mimicked in MD simulations by applying an external force between the N-terminal nitrogen atom and C-terminal carbonyl carbon atom as the âcantileverâ and moving this away at constant velocity. The value for the single molecule force constant for the springs (30 pN/nm) is realistic and comparable with that of the cantilever used in single molecule force spectroscopy experiments. A range of velocities was used (from 10 to 0.01 nm/ns). These are several orders of magnitude higher than those used in the real experiment (1000 or 10<sup>â6</sup> nm/ns) due to computational time constraints, and this results in higher values for the unfolding forces <italic>in silico</italic> compared with experiments.</p><p>Initial starting structures were prepared by running a short dynamics run at zero force for at least 15 ns except for Ala<sub>97</sub> for which a 100-ps run was used to enable it to keep its helical structure before applying force. The collapse of the Gly<sub>97</sub> peptide into a compact random coil allowed us to test the effect of force on the unfolding of a random coil. To remove starting structure bias, a range of starting structures and restart parameters were then prepared by running a sequence of zero force simulations, each lasting 100 ps. Simulations were stopped once a change in the end-to-end distance (distance between the N-terminal nitrogen atom and C-terminal carbonyl carbon atom (<italic>r</italic><sub>NC</sub>)) of at least 8 nm had been reached. Wordom (version 21) was used to analyze the simulation trajectories (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Helicity values were calculated using Wordom âdsspcontâ assignments of residue secondary structure.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Residues 813â909 from Myosin-10 Form a SAH Domain in Vitro</title><p>The aim of the experiments reported here was to test the force-extension properties of a SAH domain. We chose to use the putative SAH domain from myosin-10 that is inserted between the myosin head (motor domain and three calmodulin-binding IQ motifs) and the tail domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). This sequence (residues 808â934; bovine myosin-10) was originally predicted to form coiled coil. However, we showed that a peptide containing the first 36 residues (808â843) is not coiled coil but behaves as a SAH domain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The first 6 residues are likely not part of the SAH domain but interact with the calmodulin light chain as part of the final IQ motif (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In that study, we predicted that the SAH domain was likely to extend beyond the first 36 residues out to residue 908 from our observations of an apparent SAH domain structure by rotary shadowed EM (â¼15 nm long; equivalent to â¼100 residues of Î±-helix). An analysis of this sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>) shows that although there are fewer charged interactions downstream of the first 36 residues charge-charge interactions are still common, suggesting that this entire region may act as a SAH domain. The distal part of this sequence (residues 883â934) was recently shown to form an antiparallel coiled coil in an isolated peptide, but residues downstream of residue 909 were required for its formation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Therefore, we chose to test a peptide from myosin-10 that contained residues 813â909 to confirm that this peptide would behave as a SAH domain (as predicted from our earlier work) before subsequently using this peptide in the force-extension studies.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Intrahelical ionic interactions and circular dichroism of the predicted SAH domain from myosin-10.</bold>

Their CD spectra are complex as there are contributions from both I27 domains, which have a Î²-sandwich structure (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and SAH domains, which are expected to be helical. The spectra show how introducing first one then two SAH domains sequentially into the I27<sub>5</sub> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>) decreases the mean residue ellipticity value at 222 nm as expected for the insertion of an Î±-helix into the I27 construct. Thus, both I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>1</sub> and I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> contain a mixture of Î²-sheet and Î±-helix as expected if the SAH domain remains helical. Subtraction of the I27<sub>5</sub> spectrum from those for I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>1</sub> and I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> revealed typical Î±-helical spectra with two minima present at 222 and 208 nm and a maximum at 195 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). The magnitude of these minima is indistinguishable from that observed for the isolated SAH domain from myosin-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p><p>We also found that I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> was able to fully refold after thermal melting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>), whereas I27<sub>5</sub> was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>F</italic>). In a mixture of monomeric I27 domains and SAH domains in a ratio of 5:2 (the same ratio as in the I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> construct), both peptides were able to refold after thermal melting as the CD traces superpose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>G</italic>). In contrast, a mixture of I27<sub>5</sub> and SAH domains in a ratio of 1:2 (as in the I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> construct) showed that I27<sub>5</sub> does not refold after melting. Note that melting of I27<sub>5</sub> decreases the MRE<sub>222</sub>
<sub>nm</sub> value (becomes more negative), whereas melting of the SAH domain increases it. Hence, in this case, the folded (10 Â°C) and unfolded (85 Â°C) traces superpose. On refolding, the 222 nm value decreases due to the refolding (decrease in MRE<sub>222</sub>
<sub>nm</sub>) of the SAH domain only. The inability of I27<sub>5</sub> to refold likely results from subdomain swapping between the concatenated I27 domains that interferes with the refolding of each individual domain (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">â</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, when SAH domains are inserted between I27 domains, their high thermal stability allows them to keep the I27<sub>5</sub> domains separate in the I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub> construct, enabling them to refold. Taken together, these results suggest that insertion of a SAH domain between two functional domains in any protein would be able to effectively separate the two domains even when they unfold and that this behavior can additionally promote the refolding of these two domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy Shows That the SAH Domain Unfolds Below 30 pN</title><p>As the I27<sub>5</sub> constructs contain five I27 domains, we limited our analysis to those traces that contain five unfolding peaks, one for each of the five I27 domains in the construct, followed by a detachment peak (â¼0.03% of the collected traces). This approach ensures that only single molecules, which have been picked up by their ends, are included in our analysis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Importantly, this stringent criterion ensures that the unfolding of the SAH domains is included in the traces. Furthermore, a comparison of the traces for constructs containing zero (I27<sub>5</sub>), one (I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>1</sub>), or two (I27<sub>5</sub>SAH<sub>2</sub>) identical SAH domains allows us to be sure that we have correctly identified the contribution of the SAH domain to the trace.</p><p>The average <italic>l<sub>c</sub></italic> from a WLC fit up to the first I27 unfolding event in I27<sub>5</sub> was 47 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>AâC</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Closer inspection of the simulations showed that it is the break in the hydrogen bond along the helix backbone that is the determining factor prior to extension of the molecule. This break commonly occurs at the same time that the salt bridge between Lys and Glu (or Arg and Glu) pairs is disrupted, although the salt bridges are fairly mobile and can break and reform without a break in the hydrogen bond.</p><p>In contrast to the SAH domain, the polyalanine helix (Ala<sub>97</sub>) quickly lost its helical structure (within 7 ns) to form a helical bundle, the precise structure of which differed for each simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>E</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M114.585679/DC1">supplemental Movie 5</ext-link>).

Gly<sub>97</sub> rapidly lost its helical starting structure to form a collapsed random coil structure under zero force conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>G</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M114.585679/DC1">supplemental Movie 7</ext-link>), which is expected because glycines are not usually part of helical structures and favor coil formation. In force-extension simulations starting from collapsed random coil structures, Gly<sub>97</sub> unfolded non-cooperatively at low forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>H</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M114.585679/DC1">supplemental Movie 8</ext-link>) as expected for a random coil (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The behavior of the I27 domain in our modeling nicely matches that observed experimentally in single molecule force spectroscopy experiments. Moreover, the modeling of the SAH domain under zero force conditions shows that this peptide remains helical as observed experimentally by CD, thereby providing validation for the simulation method. At each velocity used, the force required to unfold I27 was consistently greater than the force required to unfold the SAH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>), consistent with our experimental findings. For example, the maximum force values measured at a velocity of 1 nm/ns were 2.3-fold higher for I27 than for the SAH domain. In addition, the forces required to unfold the SAH were higher than those required to extend Ala<sub>97</sub> and Gly<sub>97</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>H</italic>), demonstrating that the unfolding of the SAH domain is different from that for a random coil (Gly<sub>97</sub>) or an uncharged helix (Ala<sub>97</sub>) and that it shows a higher resistance to extension.</p><p>These simulations also demonstrate that the unfolding of the SAH domain is non-cooperative in nature in that after the initial elongation phase the force remained approximately constant as the peptide continued to be extended. This type of behavior is reminiscent of that predicted for a phase transition (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), which occurs when a crystalline structure becomes amorphous when extended and in this equilibrium maintains a constant force while lengthening.</p></sec><sec><title>MD Simulations of AFM Experiments Show That SAH Domains Refold Progressively</title><p>Given the good agreement between simulations and experiments, next the MD simulations were used to predict whether the SAH domain could refold after extension either to a partial helix or a completely extended coil structure as the sensitivity of our single molecule force-extension experiments prevents us from measuring this experimentally for the SAH domain. The simulations showed that the SAH domain was able to refold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>) with a distance root mean square deviation &lt;0.5 nm on returning to its initial end-to-end distance after unfolding to a partial helix (length, â¼19 nm) (see example simulation in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M114.585679/DC1">supplemental Movie 9</ext-link>). Similarly, it was able to refold after rapid extension at 10 nm/ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>) to a completely non-helical chain (â¼30 nm) (see example simulation in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M114.585679/DC1">supplemental Movie 10</ext-link>). In contrast, under the same conditions, I27 does not refold correctly on the same time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). Of note is that for I27 the steps observed represent unfolding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Simulations that investigate the refolding of the SAH domain (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) and I27 (<italic>C</italic>).</bold> A force was applied to the ends of the peptides by adding springs to the N and C termini and moving them apart at 0.1 nm/ns (except in <italic>B</italic> where it was 10 nm/ns), and this procedure was then reversed so that the N and C termini approach one another at a velocity of 0.1 nm/ns to determine whether the peptides could refold. The force constant for the springs was 30 pN/nm.

It maintains its helical structure when inserted between I27 domains, is effective at separating individual I27 domains, and promotes their refolding after thermal melting. The single molecule force spectroscopy experiments demonstrate that the SAH domain completely unfolds at forces of less than 30 pN at the pulling speed used, and the lack of a characteristic unfolding peak strongly suggests that the peptide is unfolding non-cooperatively. Simulations confirm that the SAH domain unfolds at lower forces than those required to unfold the I27 domain, that it unfolds non-cooperatively, and that uniquely it maintains an approximately constant force during extension. Moreover, the simulations predict that the SAH domain can refold after extension when allowed to shorten back to its original length. These data suggest that the SAH domain does not simply function as a âspacerâ separating two functional domains in proteins but has a more complex, force-dependent role.</p><p>The ability of the long Î±-helix of the SAH domain (27 turns) to maintain an approximately constant force while it is extended suggests that the SAH domain behaves as a constant force spring in which the energy stored is linearly dependent on extension. Importantly, this is different from a Hookean spring in which the force rises linearly with extension, and thus the energy stored has a quadratic dependence on extension. If the SAH domain behaved like a Hookean spring as it is extended the resulting restoring force could quickly rise high enough to detach the SAH-containing protein from its binding partner (<italic>e.g.</italic> myosin from its binding site on actin). By functioning as a constant force spring instead, the SAH domain allows a variable separation between the domains it connects without increased risk to the integrity of such macromolecular complexes. Although the distribution of charged side chains along the SAH domain is not uniform, the simulations show a near constant force as the SAH domain is extended. The reason for this is that the force measurements in the simulations are a derivative of the free energy. This free energy contains entropy and is not simply a function of the number of salt bridges (although these do contribute to the total energy). Thus, the near constant force we measure in the simulations is derived from the direct estimation of the probability of all microstates compatible with a given extension.</p><p>Interestingly, the force-length behavior of the SAH domain is somewhat similar to that reported for a coiled coil in single molecule force spectroscopy experiments (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). At a force of about 20 pN, the coiled coil was found to extend to about 2.5 times its original length, whereas the force only rose by about another 5 pN. During this force plateau, the coiled coil was shown to completely unfold as the measured change in length was equivalent to the difference in length between a completely helical peptide and a completely extended one. The coiled coil was described as a âtruly elasticâ protein in that it is able to refold while experiencing forces of up to 30 pN without any detectable hysteresis. Both the coiled coil and the SAH domain are unlike typical elastic materials in being non-Hookean; their elasticity is derived from the helix-extended coil rapid equilibrium.</p><p>It is possible that the SAH domain may function in a similar way to the much shorter six-turn Î±-helical linker between the My12 and My13 immunoglobulin (Ig) domains in the muscle protein myomesin. This helical linker also rapidly and reversibly unfolds at low forces of â¼30 pN (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and this property is suggested to enable it to act as a stress absorber, protecting adjacent domains from unfolding. It is not clear how much of the unfolding force for the myomesin linker is solely due to helix unfolding as only two of the turns are free of interactions with other parts of the protein (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Thus, it is remarkable that the much longer SAH construct of 27 turns that we have investigated here is able to show this type of behavior, which is likely to be important for the cellular roles of proteins containing SAH domains.</p><p>SAH domains are characterized by a high content of charged residues. Our observation that the long predicted SAH region from myosin-10 forms a SAH domain as does the short 37-residue peptide we investigated earlier (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) indicates that there is no evidence for length dependence for the stability of SAH domains. The lower helical content of the longer SAH peptide from myosin-10 (60â65% helical) compared with the short proximal region (75â80% helical) may stem from a lower overall fraction of charged amino acid residues in the distal region of this longer sequence (65%) compared with the proximal region (83%) that may slightly reduce helix stability. As our construct was missing residues 910â934, which are reported to be required for antiparallel coiled coil formation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), it is not surprising that our peptide was monomeric. As we know that SAH domains retain their SAH-like properties when placed next to coiled coil domains (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), it is likely that even if this distal part dimerizes in intact myosin-10 as reported the SAH domain extends up to the start of the antiparallel coiled coil.</p><p>The unfolding behavior and stability of the SAH domain may arise from the frequent charge-charge interactions, which may provide some resilience to stretching, and from the likelihood that salt bridges break individually. When a turn of helix breaks under the effect of thermal fluctuations in SAH domains, it can reform rapidly even if the local structure is considerably deformed. This explains why SAH domains do not show force peaks in AFM force-extension traces in that any of the salt bridges can break in any order. This is in contrast to the unfolding force profile of the I27 domain in which specific hydrogen bonds between the Aâ² and G Î²-strands are thought to break first before the rest of the peptide can be extended, giving rise to the characteristic saw tooth unfolding profile (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, in the context of the full-length molecules containing SAH domains inserted between functional domains, this force-length behavior is likely to be important for the cellular role of the protein. How does the SAH contribute to the function of proteins? SAH domains are found in three myosin classes, 6, 7, and 10, which have functions in actin-rich regions of the cell (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), such as the filopodium for myosin-10 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). To effectively traffic its cargo through a dense actin meshwork <italic>in vivo</italic>, the motor must remain attached to actin even when forces on the cargo/tail domain may rise high enough to potentially detach the motor. Intriguingly, the stall force for myosin-10 is only â¼1 pN (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). We suggest that on the millisecond time scale the SAH domain may unfold even at this low force and continue to unfold such that the force remains low and constant and the motor can remain attached to its track. When forces on the cargo/tail domain are subsequently reduced, the SAH domain would then refold. By extension to the range of other proteins in which SAH domains are found, this could be a general mechanism to ensure that protein domains remain bound to their binding partners even in situations where they experience higher force levels.</p><p>Taken together, these and previous data suggest that SAH domains are relatively stable over a broad range of pH and salt concentrations, are relatively rigid under bending stresses (with a bending stiffness of â¼10-fold less than that of the canonical myosin lever (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)), and can maintain a constant force level when stretched. Moreover, SAH domains show a strong propensity to refold and form a long helix when the stress is released. The reversible unfolding and the ability of the SAH domain to maintain force while it is stretched are likely to be important for the biological function of all SAH domains.</p></sec>
