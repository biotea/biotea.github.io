      <abstract>
        <p>The small genome of polyomaviruses encodes a limited number of proteins that are highly dependent on interactions with host cell proteins for efficient viral replication. The SV40 large T antigen (LT) contains several discrete functional domains including the LXCXE or RB-binding motif, the DNA binding and helicase domains that contribute to the viral life cycle. In addition, the LT C-terminal region contains the host range and adenovirus helper functions required for lytic infection in certain restrictive cell types. To understand how LT affects the host cell to facilitate viral replication, we expressed full-length or functional domains of LT in cells, identified interacting host proteins and carried out expression profiling. LT perturbed the expression of p53 target genes and subsets of cell-cycle dependent genes regulated by the DREAM and the B-Myb-MuvB complexes. Affinity purification of LT followed by mass spectrometry revealed a specific interaction between the LT C-terminal region and FAM111A, a previously uncharacterized protein. Depletion of FAM111A recapitulated the effects of heterologous expression of the LT C-terminal region, including increased viral gene expression and lytic infection of SV40 host range mutants and adenovirus replication in restrictive cells. FAM111A functions as a host range restriction factor that is specifically targeted by SV40 LT.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to counteract host cell defenses to facilitate productive infection. Simian Virus 40 (SV40) replication depends on specific interactions between large T antigen (LT) and a wide variety of host cell proteins. Although the LT C-terminal region has no evident enzymatic activity, mutations or deletions of this region significantly reduce the ability of the virus to replicate in restrictive cell types. Here, we identified host proteins that bind to LT and determined that the LT C-terminal region binds specifically to FAM111A. This physical interaction was required for efficient viral replication and sustained viral gene expression in restrictive cell types. In addition, RNAi-mediated knockdown of FAM111A levels in restrictive cells restored lytic infection of SV40 host range mutants and human adenovirus. These results indicate that FAM111A plays an important role in viral host range restriction. Our study provides insights into the viral-host perturbations caused by SV40 LT and the interaction of viruses with host restriction factors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>SV40 large T antigen (LT) is a multifunctional viral protein that plays a central role in orchestrating productive viral infection as well as cellular transformation. Discrete regions of LT are required for binding to specific host proteins and provide specific functions. The LXCXE motif (residues 103â107) binds to the retinoblastoma family of proteins RB (RB1), p107 (RBL1) and p130 (RBL2) to promote cell cycle entry. The N-terminal J domain (residues 1â82) binds specifically to heat shock protein chaperone HSC70 (HSPA4) and contributes to efficient viral replication as well as inactivation of p107 and p130 growth suppressing activities <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Stubdal1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The LT DNA binding domain (DBD; residues 131â251) binds specifically to the SV40 DNA origin of replication. The central domain (residues 260 to 627) contributes to LT hexamer formation, contains intrinsic ATPase and helicase activity, and binds p53 <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1002949-Kierstead1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The C-terminal region (residues 627â708) contains no known structural domains but does undergo specific post-translational modifications, including acetylation of lysine residue 697 (K697) and phosphorylation of threonine 701 (T701), the latter required for LT binding to FBXW7 <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Poulin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Welcker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, an intact LT C-terminal region is required for the host range and adenovirus helper functions of SV40 <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Tornow1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Pipas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Viral host range is defined as the set of cells, tissues and species that a virus can productively infect. There are a wide variety of cellular host range restriction factors as well as counter strategies employed by viruses to overcome them. Sometimes virally encoded proteins bind directly to specific host proteins to overcome host range restriction. SV40 host range mutant viruses, all of which contain deletions or truncations in the C-terminal region of LT, express lower levels of mRNA and protein for early (LT) and late (VP1) genes compared to wild type virus and fail to support lytic infection in restrictive cell types <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Khalili1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Heterologous expression of the C-terminal region of LT in trans leads to increased early and late gene expression of host range mutant virus and rescues the ability of these mutant viruses to induce lytic infection in restrictive cells <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Fey1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, the C-terminal region of LT is required for the adenovirus helper effect; human adenoviruses are unable to replicate in certain monkey cell lines unless SV40 is also present <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Stacy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The LT C-terminal region contributes a discrete activity that supports replication of SV40 and adenovirus in restrictive cell lines although it is uncertain whether these activities reflect the same function.</p>
      <p>Here, we examined host interactome and transcriptome perturbations induced by full-length and discrete functional domains of LT. The resulting data provides a global view of LT-host cell interactions and highlights cellular pathways perturbed by the presence of LT. Notably, we identified FAM111A, a previously uncharacterized cellular protein that binds specifically to the C-terminal region of LT. We provide evidence that this interaction contributes to SV40 host range and adenovirus helper functions.</p>

        <p>The C-terminal region of LT is required for efficient viral gene expression and replication in the African green monkey kidney (AGMK) CV-1P cell line <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Tornow1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Pipas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The SV40 host range mutant virus HR684 lacks the C-terminal 24 residues of LT and has significantly reduced expression of early (LT) and late viral (VP1) genes compared to wild type virus in CV-1P cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). Heterologous expression of the LT C-terminal 82 residues (C-TERM; residues 627 to 708) markedly increased levels of HR684 LT and VP1 in these cells <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Since LT C-TERM could support increased viral gene expression in trans, we suspected that this LT fragment could bind to a specific host cell factor and thereby increase viral gene expression.</p>

        <p>Proteomic analysis was not possible in AGMK cells because whole genome and proteome sequences were not available. Instead, we tested several human cell lines for the ability of the LT C-terminal region to increase levels of host range mutant viral genes. Increased levels of HR684 LT and VP1 were observed in U-2 OS but not in HeLa or T98G cells when co-expressed with LT C-TERM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002949.s001">Text S1</xref>). Given the ability of C-TERM to increase HR684 gene expression in U-2 OS and CV-1P cells, we selected the U-2 OS cell line to further analyze of the host range phenotype.</p>
        <p>To examine the effect of the LT C-terminal region on LT and VP1 levels, HR684 viral DNA was transfected into U-2 OS cells that stably expressed the C-TERM construct or empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). LT could be detected at 24 hours and VP1 at 48 hours after transfection in both cell lines. While levels of LT and VP1 decreased at 72 and 96 hours respectively in the vector control cells, both LT and VP1 show persistent expression at 72 and 96 hours after transfection in the LT C-TERM containing cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This result indicates that the LT C-terminus functions at least in part to sustain viral gene expression in U-2 OS cells.</p>

        <p>We determined the effects of full-length LT and various fragments on global gene expression. Cells expressing T1 and T16 constructs showed significant differential expression changes of multiple target genes compared to control. In contrast, cells expressing the N-terminal T6 and T8 constructs showed minimal changes in gene expression compared to control. To identify patterns of host transcriptional perturbation common across all comparisons between the set of LT constructs and controls, we applied model-based clustering to construct clusters from the 430 most frequently perturbed host genes (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002949.s001">Text S1</xref>). Of the 14 identified clusters, 9 exhibited significantly enriched GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Heterologous expression of T1 or T16 led to increased expression of genes involved in the cell cycle (cluster C2), regulated by the DREAM and MYB-MuvB complexes <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Litovchick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Sadasivam1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and decreased expression of genes in cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002949.s001">Text S1</xref>), enriched for p53 target genes. We compared the transcriptional perturbations induced by T1 in U-2 OS cells with an earlier study performed of T1 in normal human diploid IMR90 fibroblasts <xref rid="ppat.1002949-RozenblattRosen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We found that the p53- and the DREAM-regulated pathways were similarly perturbed in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1002949-RozenblattRosen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To assess the biological significance of the expression profiles we applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A significant enrichment for increased expression of DREAM and MYB-MuvB gene sets was observed in T1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, there was significant enrichment for decreased expression of p53 genes and MYB-MuvB genes in the T16-expressing cells. These results suggest that full-length LT (T1) and the C-terminal T16 portion exert distinct transcriptional perturbations in U-2 OS cells.</p>

        <p>We detected a previously unreported association of LT with the uncharacterized protein FAM111A (family with sequence similarity 111, member A; LOC63901; Gene ID: 63901). FAM111A was reproducibly detected in all five full-length LT (T1) replicates but not in the corresponding negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002949.s001">Text S1</xref>). The T16 and C-TERM LT fragments also showed association with FAM111A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that the C-terminal region of LT was sufficient for association with FAM111A.</p>

Full-length LT (T1) showed associations with RB, p107, p53, and FAM111A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, the T1 and T8 constructs bound p107 while T1 and T16 fragments bound to p53 and FAM111A. The extensive sequence coverage of FAM111A (62.4%; Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002949.s001">Text S1</xref>) and high normalized spectral abundance factor (dNSAF) values observed in the MudPIT analyses of the T1 affinity purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), as well as the strong enrichment relative to the negative control by iTRAQ analysis, suggest that LT binds FAM111A efficiently.</p>

To confirm that LT could bind to FAM111A in human U-2 OS cells, we performed immunoprecipitations with antibodies specific for FAM111A or FAM111B. An antibody for FAM111A detected a 70 kDa band that was reduced upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of FAM111A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

FAM111A also co-precipitated the LT fragment C-TERM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

        <p>Binding of LT to p53 and RB serves to inactivate their growth suppressing functions. By analogy, LT binding to FAM111A might serve to inactivate the host range restriction function of FAM111A, thereby promoting increased and sustained viral gene expression. If so, then expression of the SV40 LT C-terminal region should have the same effect on virus replication as reduced FAM111A expression.

The reduction in FAM111A mRNA and protein expression mediated by sh-2 was slightly more effective than sh-1 in both human and monkey cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g007">Figures 7B and 7C</xref>). In control cells transfected with HR684 viral DNA, LT expression was detectable 48 hours after transfection but was markedly reduced by 96 hours. In contrast, LT expression persisted for 96 hours after transfection in U-2 OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) and CV-1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) cells depleted of FAM111A by sh-1 or sh-2.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The propensity of viruses to replicate in host cells depends on their ability to manipulate key host defenses. The multifunctional SV40 LT viral protein encodes discrete domains required for viral replication including origin DNA binding, helicase activity, and the ability to hijack critical host proteins. The LT C-TERM domain is necessary for evading host range restriction in AGMK cells. We demonstrate that the host protein, FAM111A, plays a critical role in restricting viral replication, and that the LT C-terminal region binds to FAM111A to overcome this effect.</p>
      <p>Proteomic identification of LT associated proteins confirmed several known co-complex associations including p53 and RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g009">Figure 9</xref>). LT bound to all three members of the RB family of proteins. In contrast, LT was unable to bind to any of the MuvB subunit proteins (LIN9, LIN37, LIN54, LIN52, or RBBP4), indicating that LT can disrupt the p130-containing DREAM complex. In keeping with the ability to disrupt the DREAM complex, LT led to increased expression of DREAM target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002949-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

      <p>Most intriguingly, we identified an interaction of the LT C-terminal region with FAM111A and provided several lines of evidence that this interaction contributes to the host range function of LT. FAM111A binds specifically to LT, as demonstrated by two mass spectrometry approaches, Y2H analysis, and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expression of the LT C-terminal domain or depletion of FAM111A in restrictive CV-1P cells led to sustained viral gene expression and infectious virion formation by host range mutant SV40 viruses. This data strongly supports the model that FAM111A functions as a host range restriction factor that is specifically counteracted by binding to the C-terminal region of LT. In addition, FAM111A depletion enabled human Ad5 to replicate in AGMK cells consistent with the model that FAM111A contributes to viral host restriction.</p>
      <p>The observation that host range mutant viruses can productively infect permissive BSC40 cells but not restrictive CV-1P cells suggests that these cells differ in a factor that determines cellular susceptibility to viral infection. However, levels of FAM111A were not appreciably different between CV-1P and BSC40 cells, and LT could bind to FAM111A in both cell types. It is possible that small differences in FAM111A levels or activity could affect viral replication or the efficiency of host range restriction. For example, we observed that <italic>FAM111A</italic> mRNA and protein levels are regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner with the lowest expression during G0 or the quiescent phase with peak expression during G2/M phase. It is possible that differences in the proliferation rate or the cell cycle dependent expression of FAM111A in BSC40 and CV-1P cells could account for the restrictive phenotype.</p>
      <p>LT-mediated inhibition of FAM111A activity to promote viral replication is consistent with our observations that loss of FAM111A expression by RNAi-mediated knockdown rescues the host range phenotype. FAM111A is predicted to contain a trypsin-like serine peptidase domain. The conservation of the catalytic triad in the FAM111A primary sequence suggests that the protein may act as a specific peptidase. In a simple model, LT binding could inhibit the FAM111A peptidase activity. Although LT binds to the peptidase domain, there is no evidence that LT itself undergoes proteolysis or is a substrate of FAM111A and the exact role of FAM111A remains to be elucidated. It should be noted that several known LT-interacting proteins, including RB, p53, FBXW7 and CDC73, are <italic>bona fide</italic> tumor suppressors. The <italic>FAM111A</italic> locus has been recently associated with prostate cancer susceptibility in a subset of the Japanese population <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Akamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> raising the possibility that FAM111A may play a role in tumorigenesis.</p>

        <p>GSEA was run using the Java-based desktop application. Probesets were collapsed to gene symbols using median levels. Four combinations of parameters were tried for each run of GSEA: genes were ranked by either signal-to-noise ratio or by t-test, and the p-value was estimated by permuting either sample or gene labels. Only GSEA runs that resulted in significant p-values across all four parameter sets were retained for further interpretation. Therefore, although the enrichment score traces and p-values depicted in the figures correspond specifically to t-test ranking and gene set permutation, these gene sets were significant among all parameter combinations tried.</p>
        <p>The DREAM and B-MYB/MuvB gene sets were extracted from <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Litovchick1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002949-Sadasivam1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and the p53 target gene set corresponds to the âV$P53_02â gene set in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).</p>
