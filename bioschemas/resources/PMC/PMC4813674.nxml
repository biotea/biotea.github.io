        <p>Hu et al. demonstrate that the deubiquitinase Otud7b acts as a positive regulator of TCR-proximal signaling and T cell activation by deubiquitinating Zap70.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Signal transduction from the T cell receptor (TCR) is crucial for T cellâmediated immune responses and, when deregulated, also contributes to the development of autoimmunity. How TCR signaling is regulated is incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism in which the deubiquitinase Otud7b has a crucial role in facilitating TCR signaling. Upon TCR ligation, Otud7b is rapidly recruited to the tyrosine kinase Zap70, a central mediator of TCR-proximal signaling. Otud7b deficiency attenuates the activation of Zap70 and its downstream pathways and impairs T cell activation and differentiation, rendering mice refractory to T cellâmediated autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Otud7b facilitated Zap70 activation by deubiquitinating Zap70, thus preventing the association of Zap70 with the negative-regulatory phosphatases Sts1 and Sts2. These findings establish Otud7b as a positive regulator of TCR-proximal signaling and T cell activation, highlighting the importance of deubiquitination in regulating Zap70 function.</p>

    <p>T cells are the central players of adaptive immune responses against infections and, when deregulated, are also responsible for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ohashi, 2002</xref>). Upon stimulation by an antigen, naive T cells are activated to proliferate and subsequently differentiate into various effector T cells that participate in different aspects of immune functions (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Garvin et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into several subsets of T helper cells, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and follicular T (Tfh) cells, as well as the immunosuppressive regulatory T (T reg) cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). Naive T cell activation is initiated by the engagement of the TCR by a foreign antigen in the context of MHC molecules and also requires ligation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD28. The TCRâCD28 co-stimulation triggers cascades of signaling events, which regulate both the initial activation and the subsequent differentiation of T cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Garvin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>TCR signaling initiates from activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Lck, which phosphorylates the TCR-signaling chain CD3Î¶, leading to recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Zap70 to the TCR complex, in which Zap70 is phosphorylated and activated by Lck (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Garvin et al., 2009</xref>). Activated Zap70 in turn phosphorylates several other signaling molecules, thereby transducing the TCR signal to various downstream signaling events, including activation of IÎºB kinase (IKK), MAP kinases, and several families of transcription factors. Consequently, these signaling events induce the production of cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-Î³, and expansion of the T cells. The strength of the TCR signal has an important impact on the nature and magnitude of an immune response and is, therefore, subject to tight regulation by both positive and negative mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Ubiquitination is an important mechanism that regulates T cell activation and immune responses (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, including c-Cbl, Cbl-b, GRAIL, and Itch, have been shown to negatively regulate TCRâCD28 signaling and prevent deregulated T cell activation and development of autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Gu, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>). A major action of these E3s is to mediate ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TCR-signaling components, such as the TCR signaling chain TCRÎ¶, protein kinase C Î¸, phospholipase C Î³1, and PI3 kinase (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Heissmeyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Gu, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>). However, accumulating evidence suggests that ubiquitination may also regulate the function of some TCR-signaling molecules without causing their degradation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Precisely how nondegradative ubiquitination regulates TCR-proximal signaling events is poorly defined. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that the protein tyrosine phosphatase Sts1 (also called TULA-2 or Ubash3b) and its homologue, Sts2 (also called TULA or Ubash3a), may target substrates that are dually modified by ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Carpino et al., 2009</xref>). Sts1 and Sts2 contain a ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain, an SH3 domain, and a phosphatase domain (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Carpino et al., 2004</xref>), and one well-characterized substrate of these phosphatases is Zap70 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Carpino et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is currently unclear how Sts1/2 is recruited to Zap70 and whether ubiquitination plays a role.</p>
    <p>Although ubiquitination is known to be important for regulating T cell activation and several E3 ubiquitin ligases have been characterized, little is known about the role of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in the regulation of TCR-proximal signaling. DUBs are proteases that cleave ubiquitin chains and counteract the action of E3 ligases (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sun, 2008</xref>). The mammalian genome encodes ~100 DUBs, suggesting a significant level of functional specificity. In addition to their differences in ubiquitin chain-specificity, DUBs contain distinct protein interaction domains and target specific substrates (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that a UBA domain-containing DUB, Otud7b, specifically targets a member of the TNF receptorâassociated factor (Traf) family, Traf3 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Otud7b inhibits ubiquitin-dependent Traf3 degradation in B cells stimulated through TNF receptor family members, such as BAFF receptor and CD40, and, thereby, negatively regulates noncanonical NF-ÎºB signaling and B cell activation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Because Traf3 has opposing roles in the regulation of B and T cell activation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Gardam et al., 2008</xref>), it raises the question of whether Otud7b also functions in T cells.</p>
    <p>In this study, we obtained biochemical and genetic evidence that Otud7b is a crucial and positive regulator of TCR-proximal signaling. Otud7b deficiency attenuated TCRâCD28-stimulated activation of Zap70 and downstream signaling factors and impaired T cell activation and Th1 cell differentiation. Consistently, Otud7b-deficient mice were refractory to the induction of T cellâmediated autoimmunity and inflammation. Regarding the mechanism underlying Otud7b function, we did not detect Traf3 degradation in either WT or Otud7b-deficient T cells. Instead, we identified Zap70 as a specific target of Otud7b in the TCR pathway. In response to TCRâCD28 ligation, Otud7b rapidly bound to Zap70 and inhibited Zap70 ubiquitination. We further demonstrated that by deubiquitinating Zap70, Otud7b prevented the association of Zap70 with the phosphatase Sts1/2, thereby facilitating Zap70 phosphorylation and TCR signaling. Our data reveal a novel mechanism that regulates TCR signaling and establish Otud7b as a DUB that regulates T cell activation and T cellâmediated immune and autoimmune responses.</p>

        <title>Otud7b regulates T cell homeostasis</title>
        <p>The size of the peripheral T cell pool is maintained stably under normal conditions, a mechanism termed homeostasis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Takada and Jameson, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>). Although the majority of peripheral T cells are in a naive state, characterized by CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup> markers, a proportion of memory-like T cells (with CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> markers) exists and increases to high levels at older ages, which is thought to result from homeostatic proliferation induced via TCR stimulation by self-peptide/MHC ligands (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Takada and Jameson, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>). We have previously shown that Otud7b deficiency has no effect on the development of T or B cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), but it has remained unknown whether Otud7b plays a role in regulating the homeostasis of peripheral T cells. We addressed this question by analyzing the frequency of naive and memory-like T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs of both young and older mice. Young adult mice (8 wk of age) with homozygous germline deletion of <italic>Otud7b</italic> (<italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup>) and WT control (<italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) mice had comparable frequency of naive and memory-like T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). However, at an older age (12 mo old), the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had significantly reduced frequency and absolute numbers of memory-like T cells and concomitantly increased frequency and numbers of naive T cells in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Among the CD44<sup>hi</sup> memory T cell population in the spleen, IFN-Î³âproducing Th1 cell subset was profoundly reduced in the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, whereas the Th17 cell subset was not appreciably affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The Otud7b deficiency also did not alter the frequency of T reg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Similar results were obtained with lamina propria T cells, showing reduced frequency of Th1, but not Th17 or T reg, cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). These results suggest that Otud7b plays an important role in regulating the homeostasis of T cells, particularly the production of the Th1 subset of effector/memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

        <title>Otud7b is crucial for antigen-specific and lymphopenic T cell responses</title>
        <p>As stated above, homeostatic generation of memory-like T cells involves TCR signaling stimulated by self-peptide-MHC ligands (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Jameson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Takada and Jameson, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>). The reduced frequency of memory-like T cells in older <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice prompted us to examine the role of Otud7b in regulating T cell activation. We used an in vivo T cell response model involving challenging the mice with an intracellular bacterial pathogen, <italic>Listeria monocytogenesis</italic>, which is known to induce strong T cell responses characterized by the induction of IFN-Î³âproducing CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wakil et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lara-Tejero and Pamer, 2004</xref>). We chose to use young adult mice, as they had no obvious abnormalities in T cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). We infected <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice with a modified <italic>L. Monocytogenes</italic> strain encoding chicken OVA (LM-OVA; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Foulds et al., 2002</xref>). 7 d after infection, we isolated splenocytes and restimulated the antigen-specific effector T cells with an MHC class IIârestricted listeriolysin O peptide (LLO<sub>190-201</sub>) and a MHC class Iârestricted OVA peptide (OVA<sub>257-264</sub>). As expected, LM-OVA infection of <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice led to the generation of abundant CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN-Î³âproducing effector T cells, as detected by restimulation with LLO<sub>190-201</sub> and OVA<sub>257-264</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Importantly, the Otud7b deficiency greatly inhibited the generation of these effector T cells. Consistently, the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had a significantly higher bacterial load in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These results demonstrated an important role for Otud7b in regulating T cell responses to bacterial infections.</p>

        <p>To further examine the role of Otud7b in the regulation of in vivo T cell responses, we used a T cell transfer model. Transfer of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into the lymphocyte-deficient <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice is a frequently used approach to study inflammatory T cell responses under lymphopenic conditions. The transferred naive CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells that induce colon inflammation associated with bodyweight loss (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Morrissey et al., 1993</xref>). As expected, transfer of WT CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>â</sup>CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> naive T cells into <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice caused severe colitis, characterized by gradual bodyweight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and hyperplasia of the colonic mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In contrast, the Otud7b-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>â</sup>CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> naive T cells only induced moderate bodyweight loss and histological changes in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that Otud7b is required for T cell responses under both pathogen infection and lymphopenic conditions.</p>

        <title>Otud7b deficiency ameliorates pathogenesis of a T cellâdependent autoimmunity</title>
        <p>T cell responses to self-antigens contribute to the development of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. To determine the role of Otud7b in regulating autoimmune inflammatory T cell responses, we performed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T cellâmediated autoimmunity that mimics the human neuroinflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>). The pathogenesis of EAE involves priming of autoimmune T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs and infiltration of the generated Th1 and Th17 subsets of inflammatory T cells into the CNS (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">El-behi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Zepp et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, immunization of <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice with a peptide derived from a CNS protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), induced severe EAE disease symptoms. Compared with the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had delayed onset and reduced clinical scores of EAE, suggesting a role for Otud7b in facilitating EAE induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Consistently, the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had a substantially reduced frequency and absolute number of CNS-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes during the early effector phase of EAE (day 14 after immunization; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). These mutant animals also had a reduced percentage of IFN-Î³âproducing Th1 cells, although not IL-17Aâproducing Th17 cells, within the CNS-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Furthermore, the absolute number of both Th1 and Th17 cells infiltrating the CNS of the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice was drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>), which was apparently due to the reduction in CNS-infiltrating total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine whether Otud7b regulated the production of inflammatory effector T cells, we analyzed the frequency of effector T cells in the draining LN and spleen of the MOG-immunized mice. Compared with <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had reduced frequencies of Th1, but not Th17, cells in both of the spleen and draining LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). This result was consistent with the reduced frequency of Th1 cells in the CNS of the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Parallel flow cytometry analyses revealed similar frequencies of cells in both the peripheral lymphoid organs and the CNS of the MOG-immunized <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To assess the role of Otud7b in regulating the recall response of the antigen-specific T cells, we stimulated T cells isolated from the spleen and draining LNs of <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice at their early effector phase of EAE induction (day 10). Upon restimulation with MOG peptide, the T cells derived from <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice underwent vigorous proliferation, whereas the T cells derived from <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had profound defect in such a recall response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Consistently, the Otud7b-deficient T cells also produced less cytokines, including the T cell growth factor IL-2 and signature cytokines for Th1 (IFN-Î³) and Th17 (IL-17A) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>). The defect in IFN-Î³ induction might be partially caused by the reduced frequency of Th1 cells in the lymphoid organs of <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). However, because the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice had similar frequencies of Th17 cells, the defect of the Otud7b-deficient T cells in IL-17A induction suggested that these mutant T cells had a defect in recall responses. This possibility was also supported by the reduced induction of IL-2 in the Otud7b-deficient T cells.</p>
        <p>We next examined whether the EAE-regulatory function of Otud7b was T cellâintrinsic by performing mixed bone marrow adoptive transfer experiments, in which we adoptively transferred irradiated T cell deficient <italic>Tcrb</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Tcrd</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice with a mixture of <italic>Tcrb</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Tcrd</italic><sup>â/â</sup> bone marrow and <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> (or <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) bone marrow (in a 3:1 ratio). Because the <italic>Tcrb</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Tcrd</italic><sup>â/â</sup> bone marrow produces all immune cells except T cells, the only cell type lacking Otud7b in the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mixed bone marrow chimeric mice should be T cells. The recipients of <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> plus <italic>Tcrb</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Tcrd</italic><sup>â/â</sup> bone marrows (called <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> chimera) and the recipients of <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> plus <italic>Tcrb</italic><sup>â/â</sup><italic>Tcrd</italic><sup>â/â</sup> bone marrows (called <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> chimera) had comparable thymocyte and peripheral T cell populations, indicative of similar efficiency of thymocyte development (not depicted). However, the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> chimeric mice were substantially more resistant to EAE induction than the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>+/+</sup> chimeric mice, thus further emphasizing a T cellâintrinsic role for Otud7b in regulating EAE pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 I</xref>).</p>

        <title>Otud7b mediates T cell activation and differentiation in vitro</title>
        <p>To more directly examine the function of Otud7b in regulating T cell activation, we used an in vitro approach by stimulating naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with agonistic antibodies for TCR (anti-CD3) and CD28 (anti-CD28) and measuring T cell responses based on proliferation and cytokine production. When stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, Otud7b-deficient T cells were attenuated in proliferation, as revealed by a significant lower level of thymidine incorporation than the WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

        <p>After their initial activation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into different subsets of helper T cells and T reg cells, which can be detected based on their cytokine production profile and expression of the key signature transcription factor. The in vivo differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is regulated by both cytokines present in the microenvironment and T cellâintrinsic factors. Given the crucial involvement of Otud7b in regulating T cell activation in vitro and inflammatory T cell responses in vivo, we surmised that Otud7b might have a T cellâintrinsic role in regulating T cell differentiation. We used an in vitro T cell differentiation system, in which naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated through the TCR and CD28 under different polarizing conditions. We found that the Otud7b-deficient T cells displayed a defect in Th1 cell generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), a result that was in line with the finding that <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice had reduced production of Th1 cells in response to bacterial infection and MOG-mediated EAE induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In contrast, the Otud7b deficiency did not affect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation to Th17 cells under either TGF-Î²â or IL-1Î²âpolarizing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> T cells were also competent in the in vitro generation of inducible T reg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).

        <title>Otud7b facilitates TCR signaling</title>
        <p>The cell-intrinsic functions of Otud7b in mediating T cell activation and differentiation suggested a role for Otud7b in regulating TCR signaling. We tested this possibility using T cells isolated from the spleen and LNs of young adult (6â8-wk-old) mice that had no obvious abnormalities in T cell homeostasis. Cross-linking of the TCR and CD28 stimulates proximal signaling events, including tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck and Zap70, leading to activation of multiple downstream kinases and transcription factors. We found that the Otud7b deficiency attenuated the TCRâCD28âstimulated phosphorylation of several downstream signaling molecules, including Akt, Gsk3Î², IKKÎ², and MAP kinases in total T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºBÎ±, a target of IKKÎ², were also partially inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Consistently, the loss of Otud7b inhibited the activation of three major downstream transcription factors involved in T cell activation, NF-ÎºB, NF-AT, and AP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The requirement of Otud7b for the activation of multiple downstream pathways suggested a role for Otud7b in the regulation of TCR-proximal signaling events. Indeed, although the Otud7b deficiency did not appreciably affect Lck phosphorylation, it severely attenuated the phosphorylation of Zap70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Lat, a major downstream target of Zap70, was also inhibited. These results demonstrate a critical function of Otud7b in mediating TCRâCD28 signaling and suggest its involvement in TCR-proximal signaling steps.</p>

Because Traf3 deficiency also attenuates TCR signaling (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>), we examined whether Otud7b deficiency promoted the degradation of Traf3 in T cells.

In contrast, Otud7b mutants harboring point mutations in its catalytic domain, C194S/H358N (CH), or lacking its N-terminal UBA domain (40â843) failed to rescue the TCR signaling events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that Otud7b regulates TCR signaling by physically interacting with and modulating the ubiquitination of Zap70.</p>
        <p>We next examined whether Otud7b regulated the ubiquitination of Zap70 along with the induction of TCR signaling. In response to TCRâCD28 ligation, Zap70 became rapidly ubiquitinated in primary T cells, suggesting the coupling of Zap70 activation with its ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Importantly, the Otud7b deficiency substantially enhanced the ubiquitination of Zap70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), and the Otud7b knockdown in EL4 cells also enhanced the TCRâCD28âstimulated Zap70 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Furthermore, reconstitution of the <italic>Otud7b</italic>-knockdown EL4 cells with WT Otud7b efficiently suppressed the induction of Zap70 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>).

Collectively, these results suggest that Otud7b may facilitate TCR signaling by regulating Zap70 ubiquitination.</p>

        <title>Otud7b deficiency promotes the association of Zap70 with Sts1/2</title>
        <p>In addition to mediating protein degradation, ubiquitin chains play nondegradative roles, including facilitation of proteinâprotein interactions. Immunoblot (IB) analyses did not detect any appreciable loss of Zap70 along with induction of TCR signaling, and the level of Zap70 was not reduced in the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Because Otud7b deficiency attenuated Zap70 phosphorylation without affecting activation of its upstream kinase Lck, we hypothesized that the enhanced Zap70 ubiquitination in <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> T cells might promote the recruitment of a negative regulator to reduce the phosphorylation of Zap70. In this regard, the protein tyrosine phosphoatase Sts1, as well as a homologous and weaker phosphatase, Sts2, have been shown to associate with Zap70 and down-regulate Zap70 phosphorylation and TCR signaling (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Carpino et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">San Luis et al., 2011</xref>). To test our hypothesis, we examined the effect of Otud7b deficiency on the interaction of Zap70 with Sts1/2 upon TCR stimulation. TCRâCD28 ligation triggered rapid association of Zap70 with Sts1 and Sts2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Remarkably, the signal-induced Zap70âSts1/2 binding was strongly enhanced in the <italic>Otud7b</italic><sup>â/â</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Otud7b knockdown in EL4 cells also enhanced the inducible association of Zap70 with Sts1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). This result was specifically caused by loss of Otud7b, as reconstitution of the <italic>Otud7b</italic> knockdown EL4 cells with WT Otud7b efficiently suppressed the TCRâCD28âstimulated Zap70/Sts1 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

        <title>Zap70 ubiquitination is regulated by Otud7b and involved in Sts1 recruitment</title>
        <p>Our finding that the enhanced Zap70âSts1/2 interaction was associated with Zap70 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6 F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7 C</xref>) suggested the possibility that Zap70 ubiquitination might facilitate its association with Sts1/2. To further test this possibility, we first used a mass spectrometry approach to identify the ubiquitination site of Zap70 regulated by Otud7b. We isolated ubiquitinated Zap70, by immunoprecipitation (IP), from murine EL4 cells that were either not treated or stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. Mass spectrometry analysis identified K544 as a ubiquitination site of Zap70 in EL4 cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref> and not depicted). In parallel, we took a transient transfection approach by expressing human Zap70 and ubiquitin in HEK293 cells. Mass spectrometry using this approach also identified K544 as a site of Zap70 ubiquitination, although two other sites (K304 and K538) were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref> and not depicted). When Zap70 was coexpressed with Otud7b, the ubiquitination of Zap70 at both K544 and K538 became undetectable, suggesting that these two sites were sensitive to Otud7b-mediated deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To study the functional significance of Zap70 at the specific lysine residues, we substituted those lysine residues with arginines to generate three Zap70 point mutants, K304R, K538R, and K544R, and examined their ubiquitination and sensitivity to Otud7b. The K304R and K538R mutations had no and a partial effect on Zap70 ubiquitination, respectively, and did not influence the sensitivity of Zap70 to Otud7b-mediated deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Interestingly, the K544R mutation substantially interrupted Zap70 ubiquitination, and the residual ubiquitination of this mutant was insensitive to Otud7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). To study the inducible ubiquitination of the Zap70 mutants, we cloned the human WT Zap70 and its K/R mutants into a retroviral vector (pPRIPU-EGFP), generating GFP-Zap70 fusion proteins. We then reconstituted a Zap70-deficient Jurkat T cell line (p116; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 1998</xref>) using these retroviral expression vectors. As seen with the nontagged Zap70 control, the GFP-Zap70 fusion protein underwent robust ubiquitination in response to TCRâCD28 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). The K304R and K538R mutants were fully responsive to TCRâCD28âstimulated ubiquitination, whereas the K544R mutant was attenuated in this inducible modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Importantly, the attenuated ubiquitination of Zap70 K544R mutant was correlated with its reduced ability to recruit Sts1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). This ubiquitination-defective Zap70 mutant was also attenuated in association with Otud7b, consistent with the idea that the Zap70âOtud7b interaction might be facilitated by Zap70 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Furthermore, the p116 cells reconstituted with the K544R Zap70 mutant were hyper-responsive to TCRâCD28âstimulated phosphorylation of Zap70, Akt, and Erk compared with the p116 cells reconstituted with WT Zap70 or K304R and K538R mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that Zap70 ubiquitination at K544 is opposed by the DUB Otud7b and plays a role in recruiting Sts1/2 for Zap70 negative regulation during TCR signaling.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The data presented in this paper identified Otud7b as an important regulator of T cell activation that functions as a DUB deubiquitinating Zap70 and, thereby, facilitating activation of TCR-proximal signaling and multiple downstream pathways. Consistently, Otud7b deficiency impaired T cell responses to a bacterial pathogen, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and also attenuated the T cellâdependent inflammatory responses in two different models, EAE and T cellâinduced colitis. Because the role of DUBs in regulating TCR-proximal signaling is a poorly studied topic, our findings provide an example for how deubiquitination of a specific TCR-signaling component contributes to optimal T cell activation and immune responses.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that Otud7b functions as a crucial modulator, although not an essential component, of the TCR signaling complex. Otud7b deficiency attenuated but did not completely block TCR signaling, consistent with partially impaired T cell activation and recall responses. The Otud7b deficiency ameliorated T cellâdependent inflammation in both the EAE and colitis models and caused a predominant defect in the generation of Th1 subset of inflammatory T cells. Although precisely how Otud7b regulates Th1 cell differentiation warrants further studies, it has been shown that the TCR signaling strength plays an important role in regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Tubo and Jenkins, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">van Panhuys et al., 2014</xref>). Although weak signals are sufficient for the induction of Th2 cell differentiation, Th1 cell differentiation requires strong TCR signaling. Thus, it is likely that compromised TCR signaling may contribute to the impaired Th1 differentiation of Otud7b-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of T cell activation and tolerance (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Cbl-b, GRAIL, and ITCH, are known to negatively regulate TCR signaling by targeting TCR-signaling molecules for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Nondegradative ubiquitination has also emerged as a mechanism that regulates TCR-proximal signaling. For example, Itch and Cbl-b act cooperatively to conjugate K33-linked ubiquitin chains to TCRÎ¶ chain and inhibit its signaling function (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Our current work established Otud7b as a DUB that inhibits ubiquitination of Zap70. In response to TCR signaling, Otud7b was rapidly recruited to Zap70 via a mechanism that required the UBA domain of Otud7b, suggesting the possibility that Otud7b interacted with ubiquitinated Zap70. We further showed that both of the UBA domain and the DUB catalytic activity of Otud7b were required for inhibiting Zap70 ubiquitination and facilitating Zap70 phosphorylation and TCR signaling, suggesting that Otud7b functions as a specific DUB of Zap70 in the TCR pathway.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that Otud7b regulated nondegradative ubiquitination of Zap70, as we were unable to detect a difference in the fate of Zap70 between the WT and Otud7b-deficient T cells under homeostatic or TCR-stimulated conditions. The fact that the effect of Otud7b deficiency on Zap70 phosphorylation was seen within a very short time (5 min) of TCR stimulation also suggested a nondegradative mechanism of regulation. The Otud7b-mediated Zap70 deubiquitination appears to serve as a mechanism to prevent the association of Zap70 by negative-regulatory phosphatases, Sts1 and Sts2. We found that the accumulation of ubiquitinated Zap70 in Otud7b-deficient T cells was associated with enhanced recruitment of Sts1/2 to Zap70. Our proteomic studies identified K544 as a ubiquitination acceptor site of Zap70 that is regulated by Otud7b, and mutation of this site generated a Zap70 mutant (K544R) that was defective in both ubiquitination and Sts1/2 binding and displaying aberrantly elevated signaling activity. Sts1 knockdown in Otud7b-deficient T cells partially restored TCR-stimulated Zap70 phosphorylation and downstream signaling events, likely due to functional redundancy of Sts1 and Sts2. Based on these findings, we propose a model, in which Otud7b facilitates Zap70 activation and TCR-proximal signaling by deubiquitinating Zap70 and limiting its binding by the negative regulator Sts1.</p>
      <p>Our data are in agreement with a recent study that Zap70 ubiquitination serves as a mechanism to recruit Sts1 and Sts2 for Zap70 negative regulation (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This recent study identified Nrdp1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates K33 ubiquitination of Zap70 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Nrdp1-mediated Zap70 ubiquitination promotes Zap70 dephosphorylation by Sts1 and Sts2, thereby negatively regulating Zap70 phosphorylation and TCR-proximal signaling. Interestingly, under transient transfection conditions, Nrdp1 induces Zap70 ubiquitination at six different K residues, and mutation of K538 blocks Nrdp1-induced Zap70 ubiquitination and promotes the signaling function of Zap70. Because Nrdp1 does not regulate TCR signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, additional E3 ubiquitin ligases likely regulate the ubiquitination and signaling function of Zap70 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This possibility is further suggested by our present finding that Otud7b deficiency promotes Zap70 ubiquitination and inhibits Zap70 phosphorylation in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Otud7b likely opposes the action of a Zap70 E3 ligase other than Nrdp1, because Otud7b inhibits Zap70 ubiquitination mainly at K544, which differs from the Nrdp1 target site (K538). Together, these results suggest that the signaling function of Zap70 may be regulated through its ubiquitination at different K residues.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that Otud7b inhibits the ubiquitination and inducible degradation of Traf3 in B cells, thereby negatively regulating activation of the nocanonical NF-ÎºB by TNF receptor family members, such as BAFF receptor and CD40 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, like Otud7b, Traf3 plays a positive role in regulating TCR-proximal signaling, and Traf3 ablation in T cells attenuates TCR proximal signaling and impairs T cell activation (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). Precisely how Traf3 facilitates TCR signaling has remained unknown, but Traf3 has been shown to be recruited to the TCRâCD28 signaling complex (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). We found that Traf3 physically interacted with Otud7b in T cells (unpublished data), although we could not detect appreciable degradation of Traf3 along with TCRâCD28 ligation in either WT or Otud7b-deficient T cells. Whether the Otud7b/Traf3 interplay is also partially involved in the regulation of T cell activation requires further study. Nevertheless, our data suggest Zap70 to be the major target of Otud7b in the TCR pathway. These findings provide an example for how T cell activation and T cellâmediated immune responses are regulated via deubiquitination of a specific signaling molecule of the TCR pathway. Because Otud7b deficiency does not completely block T cell activation but rather predominantly impairs the inflammatory T cell responses, our findings also implicate Otud7b as a potential drug target for manipulation of immune and inflammatory reactions.</p>

          <title>Flow cytometry, cell sorting, and ICS</title>
          <p>Suspensions of splenocytes and LN cells were subjected to flow cytometry and cell sorting as previously described (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Reiley et al., 2006</xref>) using LSR II (BD) and FACSAria (BD) flow cytometers, respectively. For ICS, T cells were stimulated for 4 h with PMA plus ionomycin in the presence of a protein transport inhibitor, monensin (1:1,000; 00â4505-51; eBioscience), and then subjected to intracellular staining of different cytokines and flow cytometry analyses. For analyzing in vivoâprimed, antigen-specific T cells, the T cells were stimulated in vitro with the indicated antigenic peptides in the presence of monensin and then subjected to ICS. The data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).</p>

          <title>IB, co-IP, ubiquitination assays, and EMSA</title>
          <p>Total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to IB and co-IP assays as previously described (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Waterfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Reiley et al., 2007</xref>). For ubiquitination assays, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. After being diluted for 10 times with RIPA buffer lacking SDS, cell lysates were subjected to IP by anti-Zap70 antibody. The ubiquitinated Zap70 were detected by IB using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. IB images were quantified by the ImageJ program, and data were presented as ratios between phosphorylated proteins and corresponding total proteins (for phospho-IB), between co-precipitated proteins and corresponding input proteins (for co-IP), and between specific ubiquitinated proteins and total cellular ubiquitinated proteins (for ubiquitination assay). In some cases, data were presented as arbitrary units.</p>
          <p>EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts and [<sup>32</sup>P]-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes for NF-ÎºB (5â²-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTT-3â²), NF-AT (5â²-TCGAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATA-3â²), AP-1 (5â²-GATCTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCG-3â²), or the control transcription factor NF-Y (5â²-AAGAGATTAACCAATCACGTACGGTCT-3â²).</p>

          <title>Mass spectrometry analysis of Zap70 ubiquitination sites</title>
          <p>EL4 T cells were stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, and endogenous Zap70 was isolated by IP using anti-Zap70 (1E7.2). 293 cells were transfected with pSXSR-Myc-hZap70 and ubiquitin, with or without pCLXSN-HA-Otud7b, and the transfected Zap70 was isolated by IP using anti-Zap70 antibody. The conditions of cell lysate preparation and IP were the same as described for ubiquitination assays. To identify the ubiquitination sites of Zap70, the isolated Zap70 proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis in the Pathway Discovery Mass Spectrometry/Identification of Protein Complex Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Waco, TX).</p>
          <p>In brief, the washed IP beads were boiled in 30 Âµl of 1X NUPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris Gel; Invitrogen). The eluted proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant blue stain and excised into six gel pieces according to molecular size. The individual gel pieces were destained and subject to in-gel digestion using trypsin (GenDepot T9600). The tryptic peptides were resuspended in 10 Âµl of loading solution (5% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid) and subjected to nanoflow LC-MS/MS analysis with a nano-LC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to LTQ Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer. The peptides were loaded onto a Reprosil-Pur Basic C18 (1.9 Âµm; Dr. Maisch GmbH) precolumn of 2 cm Ã 100 Âµm size. The precolumn was switched in-line with an in-housed 50 mm Ã 150 Âµm analytical column packed with Reprosil-Pur Basic C18 equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water. The peptides were eluted using a 75-min discontinuous gradient of 4â26% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 600 nl/min. The eluted peptides were directly electro-sprayed into LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode acquiring fragmentation spectra of the top 50 strongest ions.</p>
          <p>Obtained MS/MS spectra of EL4 Zap70 and transfected human Zap70 were searched against target-decoy mouse and human refseq database, respectively, in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 interface (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Mascot algorithm (Mascot 2.4; Matrix Science). The precursor mass tolerance was confined within 20 ppm with fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 D and a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed. Dynamic modification of Oxidation, protein N-terminal Acetylation, Ubiquitination (diglycine), and Destreak were allowed. The peptides identified from mascot result file were validated with 5% false discover rate and subject to manual verifications. iBAQ algorithm was used to calculate protein abundance to compare relative amount between different proteins in the sample. Simply, iBAQ was calculated based on normalization of summed peptide intensity divided by the number of theoretically observable tryptic peptides of certain protein.</p>

          <title>Cell culture, gene silencing, and overexpression</title>
          <p>For gene silencing, lentiviral particles were prepared by transfecting HEK293 cells with pLKO.1 or pGIPZ lentiviral vectors encoding specific shRNAs or control shRNAs along with packaging plasmids. The packaged viruses were then used to infect the indicated cells, followed by selection of the infected cells by puromycin (1 Âµg/ml) for 7 d (for the pLKO.1 vector) or by sorting GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (for the pGIPZ vector, which carries the GFP gene). To knock down Sts1 in the primary T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from WT and Otud7b-deficient mice by flow cytometric cell sorting and cultured with plate-coated anti-CD3 antibody plus anti-CD28 antibody for 24 h, before being infected by pGIPz-based control shRNA or Sts1 shRNA and cultured for another 48 h. The infected cells were sorted based on GFP expression and starved overnight before being restimulated by cross-linking anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies to examine the TCR signaling.</p>
          <p>Zap70-deficient Jurkat cell line p116 and the Zap70-recostituted p116 control line (p116c) were provided by L.P. Kane (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). The p116 cells were reconstituted with WT or mutant forms of Zap70 by retroviral infection.</p>
