      <abstract>
        <p>The <italic>NEU1</italic> gene is the first identified member of the human sialidases, glycohydrolitic enzymes that remove the terminal sialic acid from oligosaccharide chains. Mutations in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene are causative of sialidosis (MIM 256550), a severe lysosomal storage disorder showing autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Sialidosis has been classified into two subtypes: sialidosis type I, a normomorphic, late-onset form, and sialidosis type II, a more severe neonatal or early-onset form. A total of 50 causative mutations are reported in HGMD database, most of which are missense variants. To further characterize the <italic>NEU1</italic> gene and identify new functionally relevant protein isoforms, we decided to study its genetic variability in the human population using the data generated by two large sequencing projects: the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) and the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). Together these two datasets comprise a cohort of 7595 sequenced individuals, making it possible to identify rare variants and dissect population specific ones. By integrating this approach with biochemical and cellular studies, we were able to identify new rare missense and frameshift alleles in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene. Among the 9 candidate variants tested, only two resulted in significantly lower levels of sialidase activity (p&lt;0.05), namely c.650T&gt;C and c.700G&gt;A. These two mutations give rise to the amino acid substitutions p.V217A and p.D234N, respectively. NEU1 variants including either of these two amino acid changes have 44% and 25% residual sialidase activity when compared to the wild-type enzyme, reduced protein levels and altered subcellular localization. Thus they may represent new, putative pathological mutations resulting in sialidosis type I. The <italic>in silico</italic> approach used in this study has enabled the identification of previously unknown <italic>NEU1</italic> functional alleles that are widespread in the population and could be tested in future functional studies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The <italic>NEU1</italic> gene (MIM 608272) is the first identified member of the human sialidases <xref rid="pone.0104229-Bonten1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18) are a family of glycohydrolitic enzymes that remove the terminal sialic acid from oligosaccharide chains of various natural substrates. In human four sialidase enzymes (NEU1â4) have been identified so far, each protein with a distinct substrate specificity and subcellular localization: the lysosomal NEU1, the cytosolic NEU2, the membrane-bound NEU3 and NEU4 <xref rid="pone.0104229-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. All of them share the Î²-propeller structure organized in six blades, each composed of four antiparallel Î²-sheets, typical of sialidases <xref rid="pone.0104229-Buschiazzo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A recent study reconstructing the evolution of the sialidase protein family in Metazoa confirmed the high conservation of this structure and the key features of sialidase active site <xref rid="pone.0104229-Giacopuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Essential catalytic residues are strictly conserved and comprise: three Arg, that bind the carboxylate group common to all sialic acids, a Tyr/Glu nucleophile pair and an Asp that acts as the acid/base catalyst <xref rid="pone.0104229-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene have been identified in patients affected by neuraminidase deficiency or sialidosis (MIM 256550), a severe lysosomal storage disorder showing autosomal recessive heritability. Defective NEU1 enzymatic activity in the lysosomes causes accumulation of sialylated compounds, such as gangliosides and glycoproteins that results in severe cytotoxicity and cell death <xref rid="pone.0104229-Seyrantepe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Pattison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Sialidosis affects approx. 1/4,200,000 individuals and is classified in two subtypes <xref rid="pone.0104229-Meikle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Sialidosis type I is a milder, late-onset, normosomatic form of the disorder, characterized by visual defects, myoclonus syndrome, cherry-red oculo-macular spots, ataxia, hyperreflexia, and seizures. Sialidosis type II is the severe early-onset form, associated with dysostosis multiplex, Hurler-like phenotype, mental retardation, and hepatosplenomegaly. The age of onset and severity of clinical manifestations correlate with the sialidase residual activity, with type II sialidosis usually presenting a completely inactive enzyme <xref rid="pone.0104229-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Bonten2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Lowden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The association of NEU1 with PPCA, a protein encoded by the <italic>CTSA</italic> gene, is essential for the correct trafficking to lysosomes, where the sialidase enzyme is processed to its active form <xref rid="pone.0104229-VanderSpoel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, NEU1 variants resulting in a defective interaction with PPCA also lead to disease, even if the essential residues for the catalytic activity are not affected <xref rid="pone.0104229-Seyrantepe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Bonten3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-dAzzo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To date, 50 causative mutations are reported in HGMD <xref rid="pone.0104229-Stenson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> database, most of which are missense variants, suggesting a high allelic heterogeneity. Recent studies have also defined a role for NEU1 in various multifactorial diseases, such as atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0104229-Gayral1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, obesity <xref rid="pone.0104229-Natori1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, diabetes <xref rid="pone.0104229-Dridi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Blaise1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and Alzheimer's disease <xref rid="pone.0104229-Annunziata1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, as well as in other important cellular processes, such as cancer and immunological response <xref rid="pone.0104229-Miyagi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To further characterize the <italic>NEU1</italic> gene and identify functionally relevant protein isoforms, we decided to study its genetic variability in the human population. This approach is today made feasible by the huge amount of genomic data freely available to the scientific community, generated by large sequencing projects. The 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) <xref rid="pone.0104229-Abecasis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> provides high-coverage exome sequences and middle or low-coverage genome sequences from about 1000 healthy individuals, while the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) <xref rid="pone.0104229-Exome1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> provides high-coverage exome sequences from about 6500 individuals, including both healthy controls and subjects affected by heart, lung and blood disorders. These studies rely on next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to generate the complete sequence of genome/exome, allowing the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertion/deletions (indels) and large genomic rearrangements (CNVs). The samples analyzed are collected from individuals of different ethnicity allowing the estimation of allele frequencies in the overall population as well as in the single ancestry groups. Overall, the two datasets result in a cohort of 7595 individuals with detailed genomic data, making possible to identify rare variants, as well as to dissect population specific ones. Integrating this approach with biochemical and cellular studies led us to the identification in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene of new rare alleles carrying missense and frameshift mutations responsible for impaired enzyme activity, thus representing new putative causative mutations responsible for sialidosis.</p>

        <p>Single nucleotide variants (SNV) for <italic>NEU1</italic> human gene (<italic>NEU1</italic>, NM_000434.3) were recovered directly from the data available from the 1000G and ESP6500 public repository, updated at March 2013. The genomic coordinates of the gene were used to extract the variants of interest from the VCF (variant call format) files containing global SNVs and indels annotations. Variants in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene were annotated using wANNOVAR <xref rid="pone.0104229-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to obtain complete functional information. In house developed tools were used to manipulate the VCF files and analyze data on genotype and allele frequency for the global population and for the 4 subpopulations described in the 1000G dataset (African, AFR; American, AMR; European, EUR; Asiatic, ASN).</p>

        <title>Analysis of variants and identification of new candidate mutations in <italic>NEU1</italic>
</title>
        <p>Variants identified in the <italic>NEU1</italic> exons were categorized in UTR, synonymous, missense, stop-lost, splice-site, stop-gained and frameshift based on functional annotations from wANNOVAR <xref rid="pone.0104229-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The latter 3 groups are subsequently referred to as Loss of Function (LoF) variants. The functional impact of missense SNVs was predicted using three different software: PolyPhen 2 <xref rid="pone.0104229-Adzhubei1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, SIFT <xref rid="pone.0104229-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and VEP tool <xref rid="pone.0104229-McLaren1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The conservation score for every amino acid position in NEU1 was calculated using ScoreCons <xref rid="pone.0104229-Valdar1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and the multiple alignment provided in <xref rid="pone.0104229-Giacopuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. According to gene data from RefSeq database, we also divided the identified variants based on the exon in which they are located. Based on NEU2 crystal structure from RCSB database (1VCU) and the predicted structure of NEU1 protein derived by homology modeling, we also grouped genetic variants in three categories, namely strand, helix or other (comprising turn, bend and disordered portion), according to the position in which they fall in the generated 3D model. Significance of enrichment for overall SNVs or non synonymous variants was tested in every category applying a binomial test. For exon categories the total dimension of the gene was considered for calculation, while for secondary structure categories the dimension of the coding sequence (CDS) was used. When testing enrichment of non synonymous variants we used the number of non synonymous sites instead of the total number of bases to calculate the success probability and the number of trials for each category.</p>
        <p>As already mentioned, data from 1000G and ESP6500 databases allow for the study of allele frequencies and genotypes in global dataset as well as in defined subpopulations. American (AMR), African (AFR) and European (EUR) subpopulations were considered in the 1000G dataset, as these 3 groups represent the better overlap with the 2 subpopulations of African American (AA) and European American (EA), present in the ESP6500 dataset. We analyzed data from these subpopulations and identified as population specific those variants with a MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) &gt;5% in one of the considered subpopulations and MAF&lt;1% in all the others.</p>
        <p>From the missense SNVs identified in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene, we selected a set of novel candidate mutations for subsequent functional studies according to this parameters: MAF&lt;1%, present only in heterozygous state, not already reported in HGMD <xref rid="pone.0104229-Stenson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> database, predicted as damaging by at least 2 out of the 3 functional prediction algorithms described above. Location of the relevant variants identified within the <italic>NEU1</italic> mRNA sequence is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

        <title>NEU1 structure prediction and analysis</title>
        <p>Prediction of the human NEU1 3D structure was obtained by homology modeling using I-Tasser <xref rid="pone.0104229-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and the known crystal structure of human NEU2 (1VCU). Refinement of the secondary structure elements, i.e. beta-strands and alpha-helices, has been carried out based on MUSCLE alignment and the positions of these structural elements in human NEU2. The already known sialidosis mutations together with our new candidates were placed on the predicted structure in order to assess their possible impact on the structural conformation of human NEU1, as well as the position of the corresponding side chains (inner core or surface of the polypeptide). All structure manipulations have been carried out using PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.1 SchrÃ¶dinger, LLC).</p>

        <p>Complete CDS of human <italic>NEU1</italic> (NM_000434.3) and <italic>CTSA</italic> (alias <italic>PPCA</italic>, NM_001127695.1) genes were amplified from 50 ng of human liver cDNA using primers containing the appropriate restriction sites (see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s003">File S1</xref>) and cloned into pIRES-hrGFP-1a and pcDNA3.1-Myc/HIS-a vectors, respectively. Both genes were cloned with their own stop codon, so that the expressed proteins do not contain any tag epitope. The pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector promotes the expression of a polycistronic mRNA encoding the gene of interest together with a humanized form of GFP, which allows for visual assessment of transfection efficiency in mammalian cells. The 9 single base substitutions selected for functional studies were inserted into the <italic>NEU1</italic> wild-type CDS using the QuickChange II SiteDirected Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and the desired mutagenesis primer pairs (see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s003">File S1</xref>), according to manufacturer protocol. Nine mutated constructs were generated: pIRES-G88A-hrGPF, pIRES-L90F-hrGPF, pIRES-P210A-hrGPF, pIRES-V217A-hrGPF, pIRES-T222M-hrGPF, pIRES-D234N-hrGPF, pIRES-G248S-hrGPF, pIRES-G252S-hrGPF, pIRES-S351R- hrGPF.</p>

        <p>Proteins samples (10 Âµg) were separated by SDS/10% PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-P PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were then blocked, washed and incubated with the following primary antibody: rabbit anti-NEU1 1â¶500 (Rockland), rabbit anti-PPCA 1â¶250 (Rockland) and mouse anti-Î±-tubulin 1â¶16000 (Sigma). Detection of the immunocomplexes was performed using appropriate HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence-based system (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce). Focusing on the NEU1 mutants V217A and D234N, a more detailed analysis was conducted on PPCA protein. All the biological replicates from each NEU1 WT, V217A and D234N were loaded on a single SDS-PAGE gel, together with a common reference loaded in all the three gels to allow for comparison of protein signals between the three different experiments. The common reference was obtained pooling together 5 Âµl from all the cell extracts from wild-type NEU1 co-transfection experiments. Western-blots with anti-PPCA and anti-Î±-tubulin antibodies were then performed as described above, followed by densitometric analysis using GelPro 3.1 software (Media Cybernetics). We then normalized values obtained for PPCA using the correspondent Î±-tubulin signals. Normalized PPCA signals for WT, V217A and D234N samples were finally divided for the normalized PPCA signal of the corresponding reference sample, resulting in comparable values of PPCA protein level. The mean of relative normalized PPCA signals was 1.04 with a confidence interval 95% of 0.62. Samples showing values below the confidence interval were discarded from sialidase activity study.</p>

Assays were performed in triplicate with 10 Âµl sample volume in a final volume of 30 Âµl. Samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped using 0.2 M Glycine/NaOH pH 10.8 and activity was measured using Jasco FP-770 Spectrofluorimeter. Fluorescent intensity was referred to a standard concentration curve of 4MUB (4-methylumbelliferone). Protein concentration was determined by dye-binding assay (Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent, SIGMA) according to manufacturer's manual. A standard two-tailed t-test was calculated for every mutant taking into account all the replicated experiments to assess the significance of enzymatic activity variation compared to the wild-type NEU1. When calculating the enzymatic activity of V217A and D234N mutant proteins, 3 samples with significant lower level of normalized PPCA protein (determined as described above) were discarded resulting in a final dataset of 5 biological replicates for each mutant.</p>

Overall, we identified 17 synonymous variants, 16 missense substitutions and 1 small indel generating a frameshift. We failed to identify nonsense substitutions as well as variants altering a splicing site. The synonymous variants are listed in <xref rid="pone-0104229-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> with detailed annotations, while the 16 missense and the single frameshift variants identified are reported in <xref rid="pone-0104229-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

        <p>Using the information available from 1000G and ESP6500 databases, we also retrieved allele frequencies and genotype counts for the 16 missense variants and the single frameshift variant reported in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene (Tables S2 and S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s003">File S1</xref>). All <italic>NEU1</italic> missense variants are rare (MAF&lt;1%) and present only in heterozygous state, with the exception of the missense variant c.263G&gt;C, resulting in the p.G88A amino acid substitution. This variant has a MAF of 2 and 2.6% and is present in homozygous state in 1 and 7 individuals in the global populations from 1000G and ESP6500, respectively.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, this SNV shows a population specific distribution, being common only in the African population from the 1000G dataset (MAF 10%) and in African-American population from ESP6500 dataset (MAF 7.2%). In the other population subgroups it shows MAF&lt;1%, and it is present only in heterozygous state (see Tables S2 and S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s003">File S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on the NEU2 protein structure and the structural models predicted for the other human sialidases, we grouped the NEU1 variants according to secondary structural elements (<xref rid="pone-0104229-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Only structural elements connecting antiparallel beta-strands resulted significantly enriched in missense variants (p 0.011). Based on the distribution of the identified SNVs within the <italic>NEU1</italic> gene and the corresponding protein (<xref rid="pone-0104229-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we found a significant enrichment of variants (15) in exon 4 (p 7.34 E-06), while the number was significantly lower in exon 6 (p 0.002). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g001">Figure 1</xref> also shows the conservation score (calculated by ScoreCons) for every amino acid position and a schematic representation of the predicted secondary structure of the NEU1 protein.

        <title>Identification of candidate variants in NEU1 for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies</title>
        <p>Among all <italic>NEU1</italic> gene variants, we selected 8 missense SNVs, predicted to be potentially damaging, for in vitro functional studies. These SNVs are rare (MAF&lt;1%), present only in heterozygous state and not previously known as causative mutations in sialidosis. To this group of variants we added the c.263G&gt;C SNV described above, because of its population-specific distribution. Thus, a total of 9 variants (marked with * in <xref rid="pone-0104229-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> functional studies.</p>
        <p>We also identified a single frameshift insertion c.759_760insGA that alters the wild-type protein from amino acid 254 onward. Due to the dramatic effect of this variant on the protein, we chose not to include it in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The 9 candidate missense variants were positioned within the NEU1 structural model to assess their impact on the protein structure and their position relative to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).

Immunoblotting of transfected cell lysates with anti-NEU1 antibodies showed the expected bands of 40 and 46 kDa, reflecting differences in the extent of glycosylation of the NEU1 proteins, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0104229-Bonten1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As expected, transfection of wild-type <italic>NEU1</italic> or <italic>PPCA</italic> cDNAs alone did not result in a significant increase in sialidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Instead, co-transfection of wild-type NEU1 and PPCA resulted in a 16.6Â±5.9 fold increase in sialidase activity compared to non-transfected cells, corresponding to 1876Â±414 nmols h<sup>â1</sup> mg<sup>â1</sup>. Co-transfection of all 9 NEU1 candidate variants with PPCA also led to a significant increase in sialidase activity compared to non-transfected cells. Nevertheless, the two variants c.650T&gt;C and c.700G&gt;A showed significantly lower levels of sialidase activity (p&lt;0.05) than the wild-type NEU1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the protein levels of these two NEU1 mutants were substantially decreased compared to the levels of the wild-type protein and the other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). After discarding the samples with low expression levels of PPCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s001">figure S1</xref>), we determined that the V217A and D234N NEU1 mutants had a specific activity of 793Â±233 and 458Â±97 nmols h<sup>â1</sup> mg<sup>â1</sup>, respectively. Thus, these two NEU1 mutants retained only 44% and 25% of the sialidase activity of the wild-type enzyme.</p>

        <title>Genetic variability in <italic>NEU1</italic> and identification of rare <italic>NEU1</italic> alleles</title>
        <p>The analysis of <italic>NEU1</italic> genetic variability in public data from large sequencing programs allowed us to recover a total of 63 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 44 of them in the exon regions, including 17 with potential functional impact, namely missense or loss of function (LoF) variants (<xref rid="pone-0104229-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>NEU1</italic> gene shows a relatively small number of SNVs that alter the sequence of the encoded protein. This has to be expected considering the essential physiological role of this enzyme, whose impaired activity leads to sialidosis, a severe mendelian disease. The high level of negative selective pressure acting on <italic>NEU1</italic> gene is also confirmed by a low dN/dS value <xref rid="pone.0104229-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. SNVs appear to distribute unevenly throughout the <italic>NEU1</italic> gene (<xref rid="pone-0104229-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g001">Figure 1</xref>), with exon 4 significantly enriched in variants. Intriguingly, this exon encodes a region of the protein near the loop corresponding to the highly variable region previously identified in NEU3 and NEU4 <xref rid="pone.0104229-Giacopuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, supporting the hypothesis that this portion of the sialidase proteins is more tolerant to amino acid substitutions. Moreover, 13 out of 16 missense substitutions identified in this study fall in regions connecting antiparallel beta-strands of NEU1 predicted protein structure (<xref rid="pone-0104229-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Overall, these results confirm previous studies, demonstrating that loop regions are less conserved and particularly subjected to amino acid substitution in sialidase protein family <xref rid="pone.0104229-Giacopuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Giacopuzzi2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>While most of the functional variants in the <italic>NEU1</italic> gene are rare, with MAF&lt;1%, we also identified one more common missense substitution (c.263G&gt;C) with global MAF&gt;2%, that is restricted to the African and African American sub populations (MAF&gt;7%). The high allele frequency observed only in a single sub population suggests a founder effect, with the SNV arising in an ancestor of the subgroup and then spreading within it. Enzymatic assays showed that this variant does not alter the level of enzyme activity and it is unlikely that it can influence its substrate specificity or kinetic parameters, given its position on the opposite side of the catalytic crevice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Overall, considering the already known pathogenic variants, together with the two new missense mutations (c.650T&gt;C and c.700G&gt;A) and the frameshift insertion c.759_760insGA identified in this study, we found a total of 6 pathogenic alleles in a population of 7595 individuals. This results in a carrier frequency of 1 every 1266 subjects, close to the value of 1 every 1025 expected for sialidosis given the case of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the estimated incidence of 1/4,200,000 <xref rid="pone.0104229-Meikle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given the large number of subjects enrolled in the 1000G and the ESP6500 sequencing projects, the analysis of these databases is effective to reveal rare variants in known disease-causing genes <xref rid="pone.0104229-Abecasis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Tennessen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> that could represent undetected pathological alleles present in the population <xref rid="pone.0104229-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this study, we searched these databases for SNVs in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene that led to reduced activity of the enzyme.</p>
        <p>Since the two databases contain data from healthy subjects in their middle age, we presumed that both known and new causative mutations would be present as rare alleles only in the heterozygous state. Applying the prioritization strategy described in methods, we identified 9 missense variants with MAFâ¤0.1% (marked with * in <xref rid="pone-0104229-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) not previously reported as associated with sialidosis in HGMD database <xref rid="pone.0104229-Stenson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, as well as 3 SNVs (rs190549838, rs104893983, rs28940583) already identified in patients with sialidosis, with the latter two having an allele frequency of 0.07 and 0.3%, respectively. The fact that MAF value for rs190549838 was equal to 0 is due to a known issue in the 1000G dataset. We also identified a novel single frameshift insertion c.759_760insGA that alters the open reading frame of the wild-type protein from amino acid 254. Even if we did not test it with functional <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, this variant can be considered a pathological mutation, since it severely affects NEU1 peptide sequence, and also removes essential catalytic residues R341 and Y370 <xref rid="pone.0104229-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Buschiazzo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
        <p>None of the 9 missense variants described above affects amino acids which are located near the active site in the generated NEU1 structure model. However, 7 of these residues (P210, V217, T222, D234, G248, G252, S351) are positioned in a region that is possibly involved in the NEU1-PPCA interaction, according to structural modeling of NEU1 pathological mutations <xref rid="pone.0104229-Lukong1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We further characterized the 9 newly identified missense variants for their impact on lysosomal sialidase enzymatic activity and subcellular localization. The individual NEU1 mutants were co-expressed with the human <italic>PPCA</italic> cDNA, which is essential for the proper compartmentalization and catalytic activation of wild-type NEU1 <xref rid="pone.0104229-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-dAzzo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We found that the majority of the analyzed NEU1 variants maintain the properties of the wild-type enzyme, are correctly glycosylated and thus potentially as active as the wild-type enzyme in our expression model <xref rid="pone.0104229-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To avoid bias in sialidase activity, only experiments with homogeneous transfection efficiency of the NEU1 and PPCA constructs were subjected to enzymatic activity assays. This study allowed the identification of two variants, namely c.650T&gt;C (p.V217A) and c.700G&gt;A (p.D234N), showing significantly lower sialidase activity compared to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Characterization of the V217A and D234N mutant proteins</title>
        <p>A precise measurement of the sialidase activity of the V217A and D234N protein variants is essential to evaluate their role as defective enzymes causative for sialidosis <xref rid="pone.0104229-Bonten1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Seyrantepe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Pattison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We thus decided to apply the normalization strategy described in methods to obtain a robust estimation of enzyme specific activity for the two candidate pathological mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104229.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The c.650T&gt;C mutant showed a 44% residual activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Even if the residual activity is still quite high compared to non-transfected cells, the mutation results in the p.V217A amino acid change, involving the same residue of the p.V217M substitution already described in a patient carrying sialidosis type I <xref rid="pone.0104229-Naganawa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and present in the HGMD database. This mutation is supposed to alter the interaction between NEU1 and PPCA, thus preventing the correct transport and maturation of the enzyme <xref rid="pone.0104229-Naganawa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This evidence strongly suggests that also the c.650T&gt;C mutation may affects the NEU1-PPCA interaction and could represent a pathological allele responsible for the mild form of the disease.</p>
        <p>The c.700G&gt;A mutant, resulting in the p.D234N amino acid change, showed a 25% residual activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Such a strong reduction is in the range of residual activity reported for many other pathological mutations already identified in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0104229-Seyrantepe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Bonten2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Lowden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Based on NEU1 3D model, both p.V217A and p.D234N are located in the same protein region containing the other already known pathological mutations predicted to affect the NEU1-PPCA interaction <xref rid="pone.0104229-Lukong1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In particular the two residues V217 and D234, together with the residues G218, L231, W240, G243 and A298 define a region of the NEU1 protein that could represent an important site in the surface interaction with PPCA partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As already described in another case of sialidosis <xref rid="pone.0104229-Naganawa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, both mutants showed reduced NEU1 protein levels by Western-blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) which correlate with the reduction in sialidase activity. Moreover, their subcellular localization resulted altered compared to the wild-type protein and the mutant NEU1 proteins showed almost no signal in vesicular structures compatible with the lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, V217A and D234N mutant proteins were mainly localized in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104229-g005">Figure 5</xref>), supporting the idea of an altered protein trafficking that probably results in protein degradation. Overall, Western-blot and subcellular localization data suggest that p.V217A and p.D234N substitutions could play a role in the NEU1-PPCA interaction/recognition, a well known pivotal step for the correct localization of the sialidase enzyme <xref rid="pone.0104229-Monti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-dAzzo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104229-Lukong1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and/or cause a reduced stability of the protein.</p>
        <p>In this perspective, both mutants represent new putative pathological mutations causative for sialidosis, at least in the late onset form of the disease. Given the emerging role of NEU1 in several multifactorial diseases <xref rid="pone.0104229-Gayral1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0104229-Miyagi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the identification of new protein variants with altered enzymatic activity could be of interest for future studies aimed at investigating the involvement of NEU1 functional variants in the pathogenesis of complex disorders.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The use of genomic data from large sequencing programs is an effective strategy to investigate genetic variability in humans. This study led to the identification of previously unknown <italic>NEU1</italic> alleles diffused in the actual population. These data are useful for future functional studies on human sialidase enzymes. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional studies on variants occurring in <italic>NEU1</italic> gene also led to the identification of two new putative disease-causing mutations responsible for sialidosis. In summary, we identified a total of 3 known and 3 novel putative sialidosis disease alleles in a cohort of 7595 individuals, a number compatible with the estimated prevalence of the disease. The discovery of rare variant based on large genomic dataset, combined with well established functional test in cellular models, prove to be an effective strategy to identify new causative mutations in known disease genes and to assess their functional impact.</p>
