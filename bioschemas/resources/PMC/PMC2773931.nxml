      <abstract>
        <p>In prion diseases, the cellular form of the prion protein, PrP<sup>C</sup>, undergoes a conformational conversion to the infectious isoform, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. PrP<sup>C</sup> associates with lipid rafts through its glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and a region in its N-terminal domain which also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). We show that heparin displaces PrP<sup>C</sup> from rafts and promotes its endocytosis, suggesting that heparin competes with an endogenous raft-resident HSPG for binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>. We then utilised a transmembrane-anchored form of PrP (PrP-TM), which is targeted to rafts solely by its N-terminal domain, to show that both heparin and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C can inhibit its association with detergent-resistant rafts, implying that a GPI-anchored HSPG targets PrP<sup>C</sup> to rafts. Depletion of the major neuronal GPI-anchored HSPG, glypican-1, significantly reduced the raft association of PrP-TM and displaced PrP<sup>C</sup> from rafts, promoting its endocytosis. Glypican-1 and PrP<sup>C</sup> colocalised on the cell surface and both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> co-immunoprecipitated with glypican-1. Critically, treatment of scrapie-infected N2a cells with glypican-1 siRNA significantly reduced PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. In contrast, depletion of glypican-1 did not alter the inhibitory effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> on the Î²-secretase cleavage of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. These data indicate that glypican-1 is a novel cellular cofactor for prion conversion and we propose that it acts as a scaffold facilitating the interaction of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in lipid rafts.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The prion diseases are unique in that their infectious nature is not dependent on nucleic acid but is instead attributed to a misfolded protein, the prion protein. This misfolded prion protein is capable of inducing the misfolding of the normal form of the prion protein that is present on the surface of neurons and other cells in the body. However, the site in the cell at which this misfolding occurs and whether other proteins are involved remains controversial. We have addressed these questions by investigating how the normal form of the prion protein is targeted to specialised domains on the plasma membrane termed cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. We show that targeting is due, in part, to a particular heparin sulfate proteoglycan called glypican-1. Significantly, reducing the levels of glypican-1 in an infected cell line reduced the accumulation of misfolded prion protein. We propose that glypican-1 acts as a scaffold facilitating the favourable interaction of the misfolded, infectious form of the prion protein with the normal cellular form within cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Our results indicate that glypican-1 is intimately involved in the misfolding of the prion protein, the critical event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) disease of humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy of cattle and scrapie of sheep are all examples of prion diseases. These diseases propagate through the misfolding of the normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into the disease-associated isoform (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Prusiner1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is accompanied by a large increase in the Î²-sheet content of the protein and a propensity to aggregate into larger macromolecular structures. PrP<sup>C</sup> is post-translationally modified with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attached to the C-terminus. The GPI anchor facilitates the association of PrP<sup>C</sup> with cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Lipid rafts are characterised biochemically by their resistance to solubilisation with detergents, such as Triton X-100, at low temperature, with the resulting detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) enriched in raft resident proteins and lipids <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Hooper1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. PrP<sup>C</sup> also associates with lipid rafts by virtue of raft targeting determinants within its N-terminal domain <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Baron1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the identity of the raft interacting partner(s) for the N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> remains unknown.</p>
      <p>A number of studies suggest that the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> takes place in lipid rafts. For example, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, like PrP<sup>C</sup>, is present in DRMs isolated from cultured cells <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Vey1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Naslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, when the GPI anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup> is replaced by a transmembrane anchor, the protein redistributes to non-raft regions of the plasma membrane and no conversion occurs <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Naslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taraboulos1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, depletion of cellular cholesterol levels to disrupt lipid rafts leads to a reduction in the PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-load in infected cell culture models <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taraboulos1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Bate1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The presence of prion conversion cofactors in a given subcellular location may rationalise why a particular site is favoured for conversion <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Campana1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Of these potential cofactors, there is evidence linking proteoglycans and their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains to PrP<sup>C</sup> metabolism <xref rid="ppat.1000666-DiazNido1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Sulfated GAGs, including heparan sulfate, were identified as constituents of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> plaques in the brains of CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and kuru cases, as well as in hamster brains infected with scrapie <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Snow2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The N-terminal half of PrP<sup>C</sup> has been shown to bind heparan sulfate <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Shyng1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, with the basic residues at the extreme N-terminus of mature PrP<sup>C</sup> constituting a particularly strong site of interaction <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Parkin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. GAGs stimulated the endocytosis of chicken PrP<sup>C</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Shyng1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and heparin reduced the level of cell surface human PrP<sup>C</sup> by an unknown mechanism <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, the incorporation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> into Chinese Hamster Ovary cells required endogenous GAG expression <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Hijazi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and heparan sulfate acted as a cellular receptor for prion rods in neuroblastoma cells <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Horonchik1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, despite all these observations, the identity of the cellular heparan sulfate involved in the interaction with PrP<sup>C</sup> and/or PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, whether it is lipid raft-associated and involved in the conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> remain to be determined.</p>
      <p>In the current study we show that heparin promotes the endocytosis of mammalian PrP<sup>C</sup> and displaces it from lipid rafts, suggesting that heparin competes with an endogenous raft-resident heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) for binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>. We then utilised a transmembrane-anchored construct of PrP, PrP-TM <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which associates with DRMs solely through the raft targeting determinant in its N-terminal domain <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, to identify the GPI-anchored HSPG glypican-1 as a molecule that targets PrP<sup>C</sup> to detergent-resistant lipid rafts. In addition, we show that glypican-1 directly interacts with both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and that depletion of glypican-1 in scrapie-infected murine neuroblastoma N2a (ScN2a) cells inhibits the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>

        <title>Heparin stimulates the endocytosis of PrP<sup>C</sup> and displaces it from lipid rafts</title>
        <p>To investigate whether heparin promotes the endocytosis of mammalian PrP<sup>C</sup>, and to determine the mechanism involved, we utilised human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing murine PrP<sup>C</sup> (tagged with the 3F4 antibody epitope) and an established endocytosis assay <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Perera1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It should be noted that the SH-SY5Y cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous PrP<sup>C</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) as reported previously <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Parkin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Parkin2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In the endocytosis assay, plasma membrane proteins are selectively labelled using a cell-impermeable biotin reagent, thus allowing their distinction from proteins either in the secretory pathway or already endocytosed. Cells were then incubated with heparin for 1 h at 37Â°C and subsequently treated with trypsin to remove residual cell surface PrP<sup>C</sup> prior to lysis. Any PrP<sup>C</sup> endocytosed during the course of the experiment is protected from trypsin digestion. In the absence of heparin, negligible (4%) cell surface PrP<sup>C</sup> was endocytosed, whereas heparin stimulated the endocytosis of PrP<sup>C</sup> in a dose-dependent manner, with 77% internalised by 100 ÂµM heparin in 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>).</p>

PrP<sup>C</sup> was immunoprecipitated from equal volumes of each gradient fraction using 3F4 and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The gradient fractions from both the untreated and heparin treated cells were analysed on the same SDS gel and immunoblotted under identical conditions.

        <p>Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions stimulate the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of PrP<sup>C</sup> by a mechanism which is initiated by the protein dissociating from lipid rafts <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we determined whether heparin could likewise displace PrP<sup>C</sup> from lipid rafts. Cells were first surface biotinylated and then incubated with heparin before homogenisation in the presence of Triton X-100 followed by buoyant sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Consistent with previous reports <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, PrP<sup>C</sup> in cells incubated in the absence of heparin resided almost exclusively at the 5%/30% sucrose interface in the DRM fractions containing the raft-associated protein, flotillin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, in cells incubated with heparin, a significant amount (37%) of PrP<sup>C</sup> redistributed to detergent-soluble fractions of the plasma membrane isolated at the bottom of the sucrose gradient containing the transferrin receptor (TfR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1C and D</xref>). To determine whether the heparin treatment had any effect on other aspects of PrP<sup>C</sup> metabolism, we investigated the effect of the 1 h heparin treatment on the expression and shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> in untransfected and PrP<sup>C</sup>-transfected SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Endogenous PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in untransfected SH-SY5Y cells remained undetectable following heparin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). In the SH-SY5Y cells transfected with PrP<sup>C</sup>, 1 h heparin treatment led to 19.5% reduction in the total cellular amount of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1E and F</xref>) which may be attributable to its degradation following endocytosis. No PrP<sup>C</sup> was detected in concentrated conditioned media in the presence or absence of heparin treatment (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the addition of heparin to cells for 1 h does not increase the expression or shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> but stimulates the endocytosis of mammalian PrP<sup>C</sup> by its lateral displacement from detergent-resistant lipid rafts into detergent-soluble regions of the plasma membrane. From this, we hypothesised that the lateral movement of PrP<sup>C</sup> from rafts may occur as exogenous heparin competes with an endogenous raft-resident HSPG for binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p>

        <title>PrP-TM interacts with DRMs through association with the GPI-anchored HSPG glypican-1</title>
        <p>To test this hypothesis we employed a transmembrane-anchored construct of PrP (PrP-TM) in which the GPI anchor signal sequence of murine PrP is replaced with the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the non-raft protein angiotensin converting enzyme <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. PrP-TM also contains the 3F4 epitope. While wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> is targeted to DRMs by virtue of both its GPI anchor and lipid raft targeting determinants in its N-terminal domain, PrP-TM localises to DRMs solely by means of its N-terminal domain interacting with raft resident molecule(s) <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus, PrP-TM offers a unique system to identify cellular components that interact with the N-terminal domain of PrP<sup>C</sup> and target it to lipid rafts. SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrP-TM were surface biotinylated and then incubated with heparin prior to DRM isolation. As reported previously <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Walmsley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, PrP-TM resided exclusively in the DRM fractions of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, in those cells that had been incubated with heparin, 44% of PrP-TM was now localised to the detergent-soluble fractions at the base of the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g002">Fig. 2A and C</xref>). As with wild type PrP<sup>C</sup>, the heparin treatment did not increase the expression or stability of PrP-TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g001">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). In parallel, SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrP-TM were incubated with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) to determine whether the lipid raft targeting of PrP-TM was due to raft-resident GPI-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Treatment of cells with PI-PLC after cell surface biotinylation almost completely abrogated PrP-TM association with the DRMs but had no effect on the DRM distribution of flotillin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g002">Fig. 2B and C</xref>), indicating that gross disruption of the rafts had not occurred. One interpretation of the ability of both exogenous heparin and PI-PLC treatment to inhibit the association of PrP-TM with DRMs is that a GPI-anchored HSPG is responsible for the lipid raft targeting of PrP-TM.</p>

        <p>To address whether glypican-1 was also able to interact with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell extracts prepared from mouse neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (ScN2a cells). Immunoprecipitation of glypican-1 led to the co-immunoprecipitation of PrP from cells lysed with either Triton X-100 or octylglucoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

      <p>By utilising a transmembrane anchored form of PrP, PrP-TM, which associates with DRMs solely by means of its N-terminal domain and not also via the GPI anchor as in wild type PrP<sup>C</sup>, we have identified the GPI-anchored HSPG, glypican-1, as involved in targeting PrP<sup>C</sup> to detergent-resistant lipid rafts in the plasma membrane of neuronal cells. Furthermore, we have shown that depletion of glypican-1 by siRNA knock down significantly inhibits the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in a scrapie-infected cell line. Thus, we have identified glypican-1 as a novel cofactor involved in the cellular conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Glypican-1 appeared to be interacting via its heparan sulfate chains with both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, as the interaction was inhibited by digestion of its GAG chains with heparinase I and heparinase III. This would be consistent with a previous study, where treatment of ScN2a cells with heparinase III caused a profound reduction in the level of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-BenZaken1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We propose a model where glypican-1 acts as a scaffold for prion propagation by binding to both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, thereby bringing them into close enough proximity within lipid rafts to facilitate prion conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). This is supported by the observation that both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> co-immunoprecipitated with glypican-1 and that both isoforms of PrP are localised in lipid rafts <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Vey1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Naslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Glypican-1 may be acting as a catalyst, increasing the rate of conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In this respect, a previous study has demonstrated that pentosan polysulfate destabilised protease-sensitive PrP with a loss of Î±-helical structure <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, a potential mechanism by which glypican-1 may be acting is through its heparan sulfate side chains exerting a similar destabilising effect on the structural stability of PrP<sup>C</sup>, thereby facilitating its refolding in the presence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Although depletion of glypican-1 did not alter the cell surface level of PrP, we cannot exclude the possibility that glypican-1 may also have an effect on the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by altering the trafficking or clearance of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>

          <title>Proposed model for glypican-1 in prion conversion.</title>
          <p>Under normal circumstances, glypican-1 (light grey) with its heparan sulfate side chains (black lines) constitutes a lipid raft targeting determinant for PrP<sup>C</sup>. (<bold>A</bold>) For PrP<sup>C</sup> (dark grey) to exit lipid rafts and undergo endocytosis through its interaction with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1, thick black line <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Taylor3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>), its interaction with glypican-1 must be disrupted (arrow 1). In prion disease, we hypothesise that glypican-1 provides a scaffold to facilitate interaction between PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (chequered) and allow misfolding of PrP<sup>C</sup> to proceed (arrow 2). (<bold>B</bold>) Prion therapeutic strategies may act, in part, by disrupting the interaction of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that is facilitated through the heparan sulfate sidechains of glypican-1.</p>

      <p>Glypican-1 itself is internalised from the plasma membrane by a mechanism involving caveolin-1 <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. During its intracellular trafficking the heparin sulfate chains of glypican-1 are removed and degraded, either by heparanase cleavage or a non-enzymatic deaminative cleavage which is nitric oxide-catalysed and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-/Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Mani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The nitric oxide is derived from nitrosylated cysteine residues within the glypican-1 core protein, formed via a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-dependent redox reaction <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In both cell-free experiments and cell models, Cu<sup>2+</sup>-loaded PrP<sup>C</sup> was shown to support the nitrosylation of glypican-1 <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Mani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Recently, it was proposed that glypican-1 autoprocessing is involved in the cellular clearance of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Lofgren1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These authors used scrapie-infected hypothalamic (ScGT1) cells and immunofluorescence microscopy to show that PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-associated immunofluorescence was increased in cells treated with a glypican-1 specific siRNA, though no direct quantification was provided <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Lofgren1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, when ScGT1 cells were treated with reagents to inhibit glypican-1 autoprocessing, western blot analysis revealed increased levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Lofgren1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. From this, these authors argued that glypican-1 autoprocessing may contribute to the cellular clearance of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, thus inhibiting this process would lead to an increase in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Lofgren1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However, prevention of the autoprocessing of glypican-1 may increase the half-life of the protein, and thus lead to the observed rise in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> if glypican-1 is a cofactor in prion conversion as our data indicate.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> still propagated following the substantial knock down of glypican-1 by siRNA; PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels were reduced by at most 55% despite glypican-1 protein levels being reduced by over 80%. One possibility is that the remaining glypican-1 is sufficient to support prion conversion. Alternatively, these data may be interpreted with respect to the protein-only hypothesis in that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is sufficient on its own to convert PrP<sup>C</sup>, with glypican-1 acting merely as a catalyst <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Prusiner1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Another possibility is the existence of other conversion-favouring cellular cofactors, which may include other HSPGs although the lack of effect of syndecan-1 depletion on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation argues against the involvement of this family of proteoglycans. In this context it is also interesting to note that siRNA knock down of glypican-1 did not completely abolish the association of PrP-TM with DRMs, suggesting the existence of additional lipid raft targeting molecules. Such components may be proteins, such as other members of the glypican family <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Filmus1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> or lipids. In support of the latter, PrP lacking its GPI anchor was shown to interact with cholesterol and sphingomyelin containing raft-like lipid vesicles <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Baron1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Whether the same additional molecules involved in the raft targeting of PrP<sup>C</sup> are also involved in facilitating the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> awaits their identification and subsequent determination of their role in these processes.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge the only other protein to date shown to be capable of influencing prion accumulation in cultured cells is the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Leucht1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. When infected cells were depleted of the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels were significantly reduced, although this may be the result of reduced PrP<sup>C</sup> expression seen after these treatments rather than the loss of a direct role for the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor in prion conversion <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Leucht1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, PrP<sup>C</sup> interacted with the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor via both a direct interaction involving residues 144â179 and an indirect interaction via an unidentified HSPG involving residues 53â93 of PrP<sup>C</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Hundt1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Whether glypican-1 is this intermediate HSPG awaits further study.</p>
      <p>Like heparan sulfate, many of the anti-prion compounds identified to date are, or have the capacity to stack into, large polyanionic chains <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Caughey1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This suggests a common mechanism of inhibition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation by these compounds, perhaps by binding to the same or overlapping sites on PrP. In support of this, sulfated glycans have been shown to compete with both Congo red and phosphorothioated oligonucleotides for binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Caughey2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Kocisko1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. It is possible that some of the anti-prion compounds identified to date exert their effects by antagonising the binding of glypican-1 to PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. The ability of exogenous heparin to inhibit the co-immunoprecipitation of glypican-1 with both PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> supports such a hypothesis. Thus, such anti-prion compounds may directly disrupt the interaction between PrP<sup>C</sup>/PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and glypican-1 which is required for optimal prion conversion. Alternatively, the observation that heparin promotes the endocytosis of PrP<sup>C</sup>, may suggest that some anti-prion compounds could act by a similar mechanism, promoting the endocytosis of PrP<sup>C</sup>, thereby directing the protein to late endosomes and/or lysosomes where conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is inefficient <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Shyng1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and/or removing PrP<sup>C</sup> from the cell surface lipid rafts where glypican-1 facilitates conversion. Following from these results, the design of specific small molecule inhibitors to antagonise the binding of glypican-1 and PrP<sup>C</sup>/PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may represent a viable therapeutic avenue for the treatment of prion diseases. With any potential treatment for prion diseases that targets PrP<sup>C</sup>, there is the concern that the normal functions of the protein may be adversely affected. In this respect, the lack of effect of glypican-1 depletion on the ability of PrP<sup>C</sup> to inhibit the cleavage of APP by BACE1 <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Parkin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> suggests that at least one of the proposed physiological functions of PrP<sup>C</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Hooper2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> is independent of its interaction with glypican-1.</p>
      <p>Although heparan and other GAGs disrupt prion conversion in both cell and animal models <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Adjou1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Schonberger1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, such compounds stimulate the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in cell free systems <xref rid="ppat.1000666-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000666-Deleault1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. From our data this apparent paradox can be explained by exogenous GAGs competitively inhibiting the binding of PrP<sup>C</sup>/PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to glypican-1 in the cell and animal models, thus not allowing the cellular and infectious forms of PrP to come into close enough contact for conversion to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000666-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). While in the cell-free systems the GAGs provide a scaffold to promote the interaction of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with PrP<sup>C</sup> thereby facilitating conversion.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have identified the cell surface HSPG, glypican-1, as a novel lipid raft targeting determinant for PrP<sup>C</sup>. In addition, we show that depletion of glypican-1 inhibits the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in scrapie-infected cells, implying that glypican-1 is a novel cellular cofactor in prion conversion. Furthermore, we show that glypican-1 is not required for one of the proposed physiological functions of PrP<sup>C</sup>, inhibition of the Î²-secretase cleavage of APP.</p>
