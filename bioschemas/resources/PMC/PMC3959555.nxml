      <abstract>
        <p>Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is typically associated with mutations of voltage sensor residues in calcium or sodium channels of skeletal muscle. To date, causative sodium channel mutations have been studied only for the two outermost arginine residues in S4 voltage sensor segments of domains I to III. These mutations produce depolarization of skeletal muscle fibres in response to reduced extracellular potassium, owing to an inward cation-selective gating pore current activated by hyperpolarization. Here, we describe mutations of the third arginine, R3, in the domain III voltage sensor i.e. an R1135H mutation which was found in two patients in separate families and a novel R1135C mutation identified in a third patient in another family. Muscle fibres from a patient harbouring the R1135H mutation showed increased depolarization tendency at normal and reduced extracellular potassium compatible with the diagnosis. Additionally, amplitude and rise time of action potentials were reduced compared with controls, even for holding potentials at which all Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 are fully recovered from inactivation. These findings may be because of an outward omega current activated at positive potentials. Expression of R1135H/C in mammalian cells indicates further gating defects that include significantly enhanced entry into inactivation and prolonged recovery that may additionally contribute to action potential inhibition at the physiological resting potential. After S4 immobilization in the outward position, mutant channels produce an inward omega current that most likely depolarizes the resting potential and produces the hypokalaemia-induced weakness. Gating current recordings reveal that mutations at R3 inhibit S4 deactivation before recovery, and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this defect is caused by disrupted interactions of domain III S2 countercharges with S4 arginines R2 to R4 during repolarization of the membrane. This work reveals a novel mechanism of disrupted S4 translocation for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations at arginine residues located below the gating pore constriction of the voltage sensor module.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant skeletal muscle disorder named for recurrent episodes of flaccid limb weakness with reduced ictal serum potassium. Triggering factors for these episodes include carbohydrate-rich meals, rest after exercise, early morning hours, and emotional stress (reviewed by <xref rid="awu015-B7" ref-type="bibr">Fontaine, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B3" ref-type="bibr">Cavel-Greant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Nearly all causative mutations in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are associated with the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 calcium channel encoded by <italic>CACNA1S</italic> or the Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 sodium channel encoded by <italic>SCN4A</italic> (reviewed by <xref rid="awu015-B19" ref-type="bibr">Matthews <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). For either of these channels, mutations are located at one of two arginines (R1 or R2) nearest the extracellular end of voltage-sensitive S4 segments, whose movement in response to membrane depolarization is linked to opening of the central conducting pore. Functional expression of channels with R1 or R2 mutations reveals an aberrant leak current through the S4 gating pore (<xref rid="awu015-B24" ref-type="bibr">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="awu015-B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B27" ref-type="bibr">Struyk and Cannon, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B28" ref-type="bibr">Struyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B14" ref-type="bibr">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B8" ref-type="bibr">Francis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This so-called âomegaâ current allows cation influx at the resting state of the sodium channel to depolarize the muscle membrane. Additional depolarization, with reduced conductance of the inwardly rectifying potassium channels by hypokalaemia, impairs the generation of action potentials and leads to muscle weakness (<xref rid="awu015-B1" ref-type="bibr">Cannon, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B2" ref-type="bibr">Catterall, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B30" ref-type="bibr">Tricarico and Camerino, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B9" ref-type="bibr">George <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B15" ref-type="bibr">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a sporadic case of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis with Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 mutation R1135H in the domain III voltage sensor was described (<xref rid="awu015-B29" ref-type="bibr">Sung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Until now, functional expression has not been published for this mutation. However, based on its location (R3) and hypothesized function of the affected S4 segment, the mutant residue should traverse the gating pore of the membrane where the omega current is thought to originate, but only at depolarized potentials in activated or inactivated states of the channel (<xref rid="awu015-B23" ref-type="bibr">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Several R3:DIIS4 mutations in normokalemic periodic paralysis cause an outward omega current at depolarized voltages, which is sustained with inactivation of the channel (<xref rid="awu015-B25" ref-type="bibr">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this work, we describe R3:DIIIS4 Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 sodium channel mutations found in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis that promote inward and outward omega currents under different conditions. The clinical presentations for two families with R1135H, and one with a novel R1135C mutation, are compared to the biophysical defects caused by these mutations as observed with electrophysiological recordings from patient muscle fibres or in heterologous expression, and as simulated with molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Families</title><p>Whole EDTA blood was taken from patients for <italic>CACNA1S</italic> and <italic>SCN4A</italic> analyses.

Muscle specimens were â¼28 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter. They were further prepared into small bundles and allowed to reseal over 2 h in a solution also used for resting membrane and action potential measurements. This contained (in mM): NaCl 108, KCl 4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 0.7, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26.2, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.7, Na-gluconate 9.6, glucose 5.5, sucrose 7.6, 290 mOsmol/l, maintained at 37Â°C, with pH adjusted to 7.4 by bubbling with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In some experiments, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> was decreased to 1 mM.</p><p>Membrane potentials were measured by use of a voltage amplifier (Turbo TEC-05, NPI Electronic Instruments) and glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl and input resistances of 5â10 MÎ©. Histograms of the potentials were smoothed by density estimation (WARPing). The potentials exhibited a two or three-peak distribution of polarized and depolarized fibres and were displayed as probability density. Parameters were obtained from a Gaussian fit for each peak according to f(x) = y<sub>0</sub> + (A / w*sqrt(Ï / 2)) Ã exp(â2 Ã ((x â x<sub>n</sub>) / w) ^ 2) where y<sub>0</sub> is the minimum asymptote, A is density, and x<sub>n</sub> is midpoint voltage.</p><p>Action potential recordings were performed with a second microelectrode. This electrode delivered a constant current to hold various resting potentials for at least 1 min to ensure recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels. Then, action potentials were elicited by short depolarizing pulses. The maximum rate of rise was determined at the potential for which the slope of the upstroke of the action potential was maximal. These values were taken as index for the available sodium conductance (<xref rid="awu015-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cohen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984</xref>) and used to determine slow inactivation parameters by Boltzmann fits.

Constructs rR1128H and rR1128C were made using Quik Change XL II site-directed mutagenesis kits (Agilent Technologies) and confirmed by sequence analysis of the coding region. Beta subunit <italic>SCN1B</italic> was housed in pgH19. Plasmids were linearized with NheI (<italic>SCN4A</italic>) or HindIII (<italic>SCN1B</italic>), and messenger RNA was generated using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGE mMACHINE kits, Ambion). Transcripts were co-injected at a mass ratio of 1Î± : 3Î²<sub>1</sub> into oocytes from adult <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frogs. Surgical procedures for extraction of oocytes were performed according to IACUC guidelines of the Animal Use and Care Committee at ISU. Oocytes were cultured in medium containing in mM: NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, HEPES 5 and Na pyruvate 2.5, with 100 mg/l gentamicin sulphate and 4% horse serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Fisher Thermo Scientific) at pH 7.4, for 2 to 6 days before recording. All salts and antibiotics were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.</p><p>To record gating and leak currents, we used a CA1B amplifier (Dagan Corporation) with PULSE 8.67 software (HEKA). Oocytes were placed between top and guard chambers. The external solution contained in mM: NMDG (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucamine) 115, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> 1.5, BaOH 2.5 and HEPES 10, pH 7.4 adjusted with methanesulphonic acid (Sigma). For external ionic substitution, NMDG was replaced by the hydroxide of Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> 115, or partially by guanidine sulphate 60. The internal solution contained in mM: NMDG 115, EGTA 10 and HEPES 10, pH 7.4, with ionic substitutions the same as above. Before recording, the oocyte was permeabilized with 0.1 to 0.5% saponin to control the electrical and ionic interior of the oocyte. Experiments were started 40 to 50 min later, and ionic currents were blocked with 2 ÂµM tetrodotoxin.</p><p>Raw leak currents were recorded with R3 of IIIS4 below or above the gating pore constriction site. To separate background leak from omega currents, the mean current amplitude between 60 to 95 ms of the test potential was taken, and the linear component of the leak current was subtracted from the original I/V relation. For each experiment, leak current amplitudes were normalized against anodic gating charge displaced in response to a 20 ms step depolarization to +40 mV with leak subtraction using âp/8.</p><p>In a separate set of experiments the anodic gating charge associated with activation (Ig<sub>ON</sub>) leading to fast inactivation, and cathodic gating charge associated with subsequent deactivation (Ig<sub>OFF</sub>) were measured. The integrals of the gating currents Ig<sub>ON</sub> and Ig<sub>OFF</sub> were determined and expressed as Ig<sub>OFF</sub> / Ig<sub>ON</sub>, as a measure of the return of the available gating charge during S4 translocation preceding recovery. The extent of gating charge return during hyperpolarization was quantified as mean Ig<sub>OFF</sub> / Ig<sub>ON</sub> as a function of command voltage.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>A homology model of the rNa<sub>V</sub>1.4 domain III voltage sensor module (S1-S4) was constructed using the A chain of the bacterial sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>Ab as template (3RVY.pdb, <xref rid="awu015-B20" ref-type="bibr">Payandeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), in MODELLER, as described in <xref rid="awu015-B11" ref-type="bibr">Groome and Winston (2013)</xref>.

At 4 ns into simulation, R2 and R3 were 6 Ã or more distant from the upper S2 countercharge. Subsequently, the side chain of R3 passed the aromatic ring of F1073 to reside near E1076 in S2. At 10 ns, R4 was no longer in proximity to E1076.</p><p>MD simulations for rR1128H/C shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="awu015-F6">Fig. 6</xref>C (middle and bottom panels) revealed several differences in countercharge to DIIIS4 interactions, compared to wild-type channels. For example, R3C and R3H were each 6 Ã or more distant from D1066 at the start of simulation, and neither came in close proximity to E1076 in response to membrane hyperpolarization. For each R3 mutant channel, R2:D1066 and R4:E1076 proximities were similar to those for wild-type rNa<sub>V</sub>1.4, at the start of simulation. However, in rR1128C the R2:D1066 proximity measurement remained within 3 Ã throughout simulation, and for both mutants, R4 remained in close proximity to E1076.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Genotypeâphenotype correlation</title><p>Our results with native R1135H muscle fibres show that mutation at R3 increases the probability of depolarized resting membrane potentials under normal conditions. At low external potassium and after strong depolarizations in chloride-free solutions, the depolarization tendency is only marginal. Likewise, <sup>23</sup>Na-MRI showed a normal result. Additionally, the amplitude of the inward omega currents were only â¼5% to 10% to those of R1 or R2 previously described (<xref rid="awu015-B26" ref-type="bibr">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, since inward omega currents only occur when IIIS4 has moved outward and been immobilized, they are not produced by the total mutant channel population but only by a portion of these, further reducing the effect of the mutation. Therefore, the effects of both mutations may indeed be slight.</p><p>As to the recessiveness of R1135C, we hypothesize that epigenetic factors or the differential effects of the two mutations on activation and recovery of the central pore current may be decisive for development of symptoms and the resulting mode of inheritance. As the dominant mutation R1135H slows all transitions presumably because of the bulkiness of the histidine residue, it could have a larger effect on the action potential and excitability in general than the recessive mutation R1135C.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms for the effects of R3:DIIIS4 mutations</title><sec><title>Effect of the outward omega currents</title><p>Recordings from patient muscle fibres showed an overall inexcitability, reduced amplitude and slowed rate of rise of action potentials. The reduced rate of rise to 50% action potential amplitude cannot be explained by depolarization-induced sodium channel inactivation, since we repolarized these fibres down to â120 mV for at least 1 min prior to action potential measurements. Cut-open oocyte recordings of R3:DIIIS4 mutations showed an outward omega current that is activated over the depolarized voltage range, a finding that is in agreement with earlier studies showing that mutations at R3:DIIS4 that cause normokalemic periodic paralysis (<xref rid="awu015-B32" ref-type="bibr">Vicart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) also produce an outwardly directed omega current (<xref rid="awu015-B25" ref-type="bibr">Sokolov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our action potential recordings therefore suggest that outward omega current in R3C/H may contribute to reduced excitability by shunting excitatory current through the gating pore in the depolarized voltage range for which action potential initiation is expected. In addition to its effect on action potential initiation, the outward omega current in R3C/H may provide a counteraction to chloride loss, explaining the ability of these fibres to repolarize in chloride-free solutions. This current may augment the intrinsic repolarizing mechanisms of ATPase and NKCC transporters (<xref rid="awu015-B18" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann-Horn and Jurkat-Rott, 1999</xref>). Possibly, the outward omega current is also able to reduce ictal hypokalaemia down to the mild levels found in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of inward omega currents and disrupted S4 translocation</title><p>We found that each of the hypokalaemeic periodic paralysis mutations at R3:DIIIS4 impedes the downwards movement of S4, or deactivation, when channels were inactivated, and thus S4 is immobilized. The resulting small inward omega current is the basis for typical pathogenesis of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis as previously described (<xref rid="awu015-B1" ref-type="bibr">Cannon, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B2" ref-type="bibr">Catterall, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B30" ref-type="bibr">Tricarico and Camerino, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B9" ref-type="bibr">George, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="awu015-B15" ref-type="bibr">Jurkat-Rott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, for the mutations at R3 the omega current is produced by a different mechanism than the previously described mutations, namely by a disturbed S4 movement during recovery from the inactivated state. Specifically, whereas S4 translocation and R3 passage upwards through the gating pore is relatively favourable, the reverse translocation is impeded and results in a prolonged non-occlusion of the pore i.e. enhancing the inward omega current. The effect of the hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations on S4 translocation may be their predominant effect to decrease membrane excitability in channels that have fast inactivated in the process of firing action potentials. For example, it has been shown that the voltage sensors in domains III and IV are immobilized during fast inactivation (<xref rid="awu015-B4" ref-type="bibr">Cha <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), with immobilization of the DIIIS4 sensor coupled to binding of the IFMT particle to its receptor (<xref rid="awu015-B22" ref-type="bibr">Sheets <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Therefore, our finding that hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations at R3:DIIIS4 inhibit S4 translocation from a state of immobilization is consistent with the finding that these mutations slow the overall recovery of channels from fast inactivation.</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations support the results of gating current measurements that show R3C/H impedes S4 translocation during deactivation. Proximity measurements taken during these trajectories suggest that DIIIS2 countercharges may be an important substrate of voltage sensor translocation during recovery, and that the effect of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations involves a decreased interaction of those S2 countercharges with R3 as the S4 segment traverses the gating pore towards the resting state. This hypothesis is supported by a previous study using molecular dynamics to investigate intermediate states of voltage sensor translocation in rNa<sub>V</sub>1.4 (<xref rid="awu015-B10" ref-type="bibr">Gosselin-Badaroudine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In that simulation of wild-type rNa<sub>V</sub>1.4, interaction of R3:DIIIS4 with the outer S2 charge (D1066) is proposed for the activated state of the channel, whereas interaction of R3:DIIIS4 with an inner S2 charge (E1076) is proposed for intermediate and resting states. Additionally, R4 interacts with E1076 in the activated and intermediate, but not resting state. Each of these interactions was reiterated in our simulations of rNa<sub>V</sub>1.4. By incorporating the hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations into our simulations, we found that R3H/C each may have limited interaction with the outer and inner S2 residues during voltage sensor translocation, and that the R4:E1076 interaction persists in the resting state of the channel. Therefore, we propose that R3:DIIIS4 hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutations disrupt native electrostatic interactions in the voltage sensor module necessary for recovery.</p></sec></sec></sec>
