        <p>High molecular weight homologues of gp91<italic>phox,</italic> the superoxide-generating subunit of phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase, have been identified in human (h) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (Ce), and are termed Duox for âdual oxidaseâ because they have both a peroxidase homology domain and a gp91<italic>pho</italic>x domain. A topology model predicts that the enzyme will utilize cytosolic NADPH to generate reactive oxygen, but the function of the ecto peroxidase domain was unknown. Ce-Duox1 is expressed in hypodermal cells underlying the cuticle of larval animals. To investigate function, RNA interference (RNAi) was carried out in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. RNAi animals showed complex phenotypes similar to those described previously in mutations in collagen biosynthesis that are known to affect the cuticle, an extracellular matrix. Electron micrographs showed gross abnormalities in the cuticle of RNAi animals. In cuticle, collagen and other proteins are cross-linked via di- and trityrosine linkages, and these linkages were absent in RNAi animals. The expressed peroxidase domains of both Ce-Duox1 and h-Duox showed peroxidase activity and catalyzed cross-linking of free tyrosine ethyl ester. Thus, Ce-Duox catalyzes the cross-linking of tyrosine residues involved in the stabilization of cuticular extracellular matrix.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Reactive oxygen generation is well characterized in phagocytes where the respiratory burst oxidase (termed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH]<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref>-oxidase) catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of molecular oxygen to generate superoxide and secondarily metabolites including hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Babior, 1995</xref>). In the phagocyte, reactive oxygen generation is robust, and high levels of reactive oxygen species participate in bacterial killing. In recent years, it has become clear that nonphagocytic cells also generate reactive oxygen, albeit at lower levels (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cross and Jones, 1991</xref>). The origin and function of this reactive oxygen has not been clear and has been attributed variously to âleakyâ mitochondrial respiration, the activity of enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, or to the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase itself. In some cases, the reactive oxygen-generating system has properties reminiscent of the phagocyte oxidase (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Emmendorffer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Griendling et al., 1994</xref>), but it has often been difficult to demonstrate significant expression of critical phagocyte oxidase components in these cell types (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Emmendorffer et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting the existence of one or more homologues of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase.</p>
      <p>The phagocyte NADPH-oxidase consists of multiple subunits including gp91<italic>phox</italic>, the catalytic moiety (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Babior, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). In activated cells, this subunit is associated with the plasma membrane (or with the phagosomal membrane, which is derived from the plasma membrane) and consists of a COOH-terminal flavoprotein domain containing the NADPH-binding site (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rotrosen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Segal et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Takeshige and Sumimoto, 1994</xref>) and an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal hydrophobic region comprised of five to six transmembrane Î± helices and harboring the two heme groups (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Nisimoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). The structure of the enzyme permits the coupling of the oxidation of intracellular NADPH to the reduction of molecular oxygen to generate extracellular or phagosomal superoxide. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is secreted extracellularly or into the phagosome, permitting reactive oxygen generated by the phagocyte oxidase to support hypochlorous acid generation in the extracellular/phagosomal compartment (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hampton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Nauseef, 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>Based on the hypothesis that reactive oxygen generation in nonphagocytic cells originates in part from homologues of the phagocyte oxidase, we have searched for and molecularly cloned homologues of gp91<italic>phox</italic>. The first of these, Nox1 (also termed Mox1, NOH-1), is expressed in nonphagocytic cells, including colonic epithelia and vascular smooth muscle (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suh et al., 1999</xref>), and functions in regulating cell growth and cell transformation. Alternative splicing of Nox1 to generate a portion of the membrane domain produces a proton channel (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Banfi et al., 2000</xref>) with properties similar to voltage-gated channels. Additional homologues of gp91<italic>phox</italic> that are similar in size to gp91<italic>phox</italic> (â¼65 kD) have been reported recently (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lambeth et al<italic>.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the present study, we describe large molecular weight homologues of gp91<italic>phox</italic> termed Duox, which are present in human and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The term Duox, referring to dual oxidase, has been accepted by the Human Genome Organisation International Committee on Gene Nomenclature. A partial sequence of Duox2 was reported recently and termed p138<sup>Tox</sup>, referring to thyroid oxidase. Surprisingly, these homologues contain not only the gp91<italic>phox</italic> homology region at the COOH terminus but also an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region that is homologous to peroxidases including MPO. Using RNA interference (RNAi) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to knock out the expression of the nematode Duox1, we find that Duox participates through tyrosine cross-linking in the biogenesis of cuticle, the collagenous extracellular matrix that forms the outer covering of nematodes. The tyrosine cross-linking reaction has also been reconstituted biochemically using the expressed peroxidase domains of human (h)-Duox and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (Ce)-Duox1.</p>

        <p>The cDNA for h-Duox1 was a 4,563 base pair ORF (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF213465">AF213465</ext-link>) that is predicted to encode a protein of 1,521 amino acids (177 kD), nearly three times the size of gp91<italic>phox</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)
. A consensus Kozak sequence, <underline>A</underline>TC<underline>ATGG</underline>, was present at the translation start codon. The cDNA for h-Duox2 showed a 4,647 base pair ORF (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF267981">AF267981</ext-link>) that is predicted to encode a protein of 1,548 amino acids (175 kD) and contained a consensus Kozak sequence, <underline>G</underline>GC<underline>ATG</underline>C, at the translation start codon. The Duox2 cDNA sequence is a larger form of a gp91<italic>phox</italic> homologue identified previously as an NADPH-oxidase in thyroid and termed p138<sup>Tox</sup>; the latter sequence did not contain the peroxidase homology domain (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dupuy et al<italic>.</italic>, 1999</xref>). h-Duox1 and h-Duox2 were 77% identical at the amino acid level. These sequences were independently cloned recently and reported by De Deken et al<italic>.</italic> (2000).</p>

        <p>A BLAST search of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genomic database using as a query the protein sequence of gp91<italic>phox</italic> identified two homologous genes contained in cosmids F56C11 and F53G12. The Ce-Duox1 conceptual transcript (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF043697">AF043697</ext-link>) is predicted to be 8,197 bp before splicing, to contain 19 exons, and to encode a protein of 1,506 amino acids. Cloning of the cDNA for Ce-Duox1 (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF229855">AF229855</ext-link>) revealed a cDNA of 4,491 bp (1,497 amino acids), which differed somewhat from the conceptual cDNA obtained from the gene structure due to inaccuracies in the predicted intron-exon junctions. The second transcript, Ce-Duox2 (sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF043697">AF043697</ext-link>), is predicted to be 5,308 bp before splicing, to contain 16 exons, and to encode a 1,313 amino acid protein. Alignment by homology of the genomic sequences of Ce-Duox1 and Ce-Duox2 identified two new exons 5â² of the first predicted exon of Duox2 that were highly homologous to the second and third exons of Duox1 (predicted cDNA structure available upon request), but an exon of Duox2 homologous to exon1 of Duox1 could not be identified by homology. The predicted amino acid sequences of both Ce-Duox1 and Ce-Duox2 show â¼30% identity with h-Duox1 and h-Duox2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
A). Ce-Duox1 also contains the same domains as h-Duox1/2 (see below) and is roughly the same size. However, Ce-Duox2 contains a stop codon, which should eliminate the extreme COOH-terminal portion of the protein, which includes a segment of the pyridine nucleotide-binding site. Thus, whereas Ce-Duox2 should contain intact peroxidase and calmodulin-like domains, it is not predicted to encode a functioning NADPH-oxidase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Except for this COOH-terminal region, Ce-Duox2 is 94% identical to Ce-Duox1 at the amino acid level. Both Ce-Duox1 and Ce-Duox2 are located near the end of chromosome I, separated by only 6 kb and in opposite orientations. The high degree of sequence identity and retention of intron structure (unpublished data) and the location of both near the end of a chromosome are consistent with a recent gene duplication.</p>

        <title>Domain organization and sequence comparisons among gp91<italic>phox</italic>, h-Duox1, Ce-Duox1, and Ce-Duox2</title>
        <p>The domain structure and transmembrane regions in gp91<italic>phox</italic>, h-Duox1/2, Ce-Duox1, and Ce-Duox2 are diagrammed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Duox enzymes are homologous to gp91<italic>phox</italic> in their COOH termini (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biochem.emory.edu/Lambeth/gp91_homology.pdf">http://www.biochem.emory.edu/Lambeth/gp91_homology.pdf</ext-link> for an alignment of these regions). Nox1 (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suh et al., 1999</xref>), which is the same size as gp91<italic>phox</italic>, is more closely related to gp91<italic>phox</italic> (54% identical) than is the NADPH-oxidase domain of hDuox1 or h-Duox2 (â¼26% identical to gp91<italic>phox</italic>). However, h-Duox1 and 2 are more closely related to Ce-Duox1 within the NADPH-oxidase domain (â¼39% identical). Within the putative flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding regions and NADPH-binding regions, homologues share considerably higher homology, ranging from 60 to 90% depending on the region. This includes the canonical dinucleotide-binding helix GXGXXP. In gp91<italic>phox</italic>, Nox1, h-Duox1, and h-Duox2, this sequence is followed by F, which is present in many NADPH-specific flavoproteins, whereas in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins F is conservatively replaced with Y.</p>
        <p>Duox proteins have additional regions that are not present in gp91<italic>phox</italic>. A central region contains two EF-hand calcium-binding sequences as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The canonical residues involved in calcium ligation are well conserved in h-Duox1 and h-Duox2 but are poorly conserved in Ce-Duox1 and Ce-Duox2, suggesting that the function of this region may have evolved away from calcium binding in nematodes.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal third of Duox proteins is homologous to peroxidases including MPO, eosinophil peroxidase, thyroid peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, and sea urchin ovoperoxidases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Overall, the identity with peroxidases within the entire region is â¼20%, but subregions show considerably higher homology. The Duox enzymes represent a distinct group within the peroxidase family (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B), and phylogenetically this group is marginally more closely related to sea urchin ovoperoxidases. Within the peroxidase homology region, only 2 of the 12 cysteine residues involved in the six intrachain disulfide bonds, which are conserved in the four homologous mammalian peroxidases, are present in Duox proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). In addition, the asparagine-linked glycosylation sites found in MPO are not present in Ce-Duox1 or Ce-Duox2. A calcium-binding site in MPO (aspartate 263 and residues 335â34; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, superior double bar) (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Zeng and Fenna, 1992</xref>) is well conserved in the Duox family proteins, including three of the four candidate calcium liganding residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, â´).</p>
        <p>The extreme NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 21 amino acids of Ce-Duox1 contain a secretory signal peptide sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), implying that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal peroxidase domain is in a compartment that is transmembrane to the cytosol (for example, extracellular or within a secretory vesicle). In addition, hydropathy plots reveal that the proteins contain a highly hydrophobic region corresponding to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal third of gp91<italic>phox</italic>. This region can be modeled as a cluster of six transmembrane Î± helices as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. An additional transmembrane helical region is present between the peroxidase homology domain and the calmodulin-like domain.</p>

As reported previously (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dupuy et al., 1999</xref>), Duox2 (p138<sup>Tox</sup>) is present in thyroid.

        <title>Cellular distribution of Ce-Duox1</title>
        <p>The cellular location of Ce-Duox1 was determined by double staining with antibodies to Ce-Duox1 and to the muscle marker myosin A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>)
. In a longitudinal section, Ce-Duox1 immunostaining was seen in larval animals in a âstring-of-pearlsâ pattern (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, green) immediately peripheral to muscle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, red). Ce-Duox1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, green) was also visualized immediately peripheral to muscle bundles (red) in the cross-sectional plane. Ce-Duox1 staining was considerably weaker in adult animals (unpublished data). The above pattern is consistent with a localization of Ce-Duox1 in hypodermal cells. To verify this localization, double staining was carried out with antibodies to Ce-Duox1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, CâH, green) and to the hypodermal cell protein MH4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, CâH, red). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, CâE</xref>, shows the longitudinal plane, whereas <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, F and G</xref>, shows the cross-sectional plane. Comparison shows that expression of Ce-Duox1 and MH4 occurs in the same cellular pattern, although the staining intensity differed in different regions of the hypodermal cell layer. Merged images are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, E and H</xref>, and reveal colocalization in many of the hypodermal cells. Immunostaining with antibody to Ce-Duox1 that had been preincubated with Ce-Duox1(340â355) peptide and antimyosin A antibodies eliminated staining in the green channel (unpublished data), demonstrating antibody specificity.</p>

        <title>Phenotypes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNAi Ce-Duox animals</title>
        <p>To gain insights regarding the biological function of Duox enzymes, we used the reverse genetic tool, RNAi, to âknock outâ Duox in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fire et al., 1998</xref>). This technique involves injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), encoding a segment of Ce-Duox1 or Ce-Duox2 into gonads of <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild-type hermaphrodites. Injected animals were then allowed to lay eggs, the harvested eggs were allowed to develop, and the progeny were observed for phenotypes. This procedure specifically diminishes or eliminates the expression of the gene of interest. dsRNA corresponding to three distinct regions of Ce-Duox1 and Duox2 were used in separate experiments. The first two correspond to regions of identity between Ce-Duox1 and Ce-Duox2 and are predicted to block the expression of both forms of Duox. The third dsRNA corresponds to the extreme COOH terminus of Ce-Duox1, which does not have a counterpart in Ce-Duox2, and therefore blocks only the expression of Ce-Duox1. All three dsRNA forms resulted in the same range of phenotypes. In replicate experiments, the percentage of animals exhibiting any given phenotype was somewhat variable, probably due to differences in amount of RNAi or site of injection. However, in a typical experiment &gt;90% of the animals were affected by one or more phenotypes. In a typical experiment, phenotypes included the presence of large superficial blisters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
B, â¼50% of animals) and short or âdumpyâ animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, â¼35% of animals) and animals with retained eggs or larvae (unpublished data). In addition, whereas wild-type animals showed a dark appearance, &gt;80% of RNAi animals were translucent (compare wild-type, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and D</xref>, animal on right with affected animals in D, animal on left, and B and C). Around half of RNAi animals showed an inability to move on plates in a normal serpentine manner: affected animals were either completely paralyzed or moved only the anterior region, clearing a localized swath of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in the vicinity of the head (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>).</p>

        <p>Similar phenotypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been described previously and are associated with mutations in the collagen biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Levy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Grupta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Johnstone, 2000</xref>). Several genes that encode cuticle collagens when mutated result in Bli (âblisterâ), Dpy (âdumpy,â short fat worm), Rol (âroller,â helical motion instead of a flat, sinusoidal motion), or Sqt (âsquat,â generally rollers as larvae and dumpy as adults) phenotypes. The genetics of this process are complex, since for some genes different mutations in the same gene give rise to different phenotypes, and sometimes the phenotypes are combined (for example, âdumpy rollerâ). In nematodes, collagen along with several other proteins provide the major components of cuticle, an extracellular matrix which acts as an exoskeleton. In a global analysis of expression of all <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes using oligonucleotide arrays (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2000</xref>), Ce-Duox1 was expressed at low levels (consistent with its exclusive expression in hypodermal cells) in a stage-specific manner. Expression occurred in a cyclic pattern, peaking during the embryonic stage and at 36 h, corresponding to the peak expression of other genes (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Johnstone, 2000</xref>) related to collagen/cuticle biosynthesis (<italic>col-14</italic>, <italic>dpy-2,-7,-10</italic>, and <italic>sqt-3</italic>). A second set of collagen/cuticle-related genes (<italic>bli-1</italic>,<italic>-2</italic>, <italic>col-2, -6,-17,-35,-36,-37,-41</italic>, <italic>dyp-13</italic>, <italic>sqt-1</italic>, and <italic>rol-6,-8</italic>) also show peak expression at 36 h. No significant expression of Ce-Duox2 was seen at any stage. Thus, these data are consistent with a function of Ce-Duox1 in cuticle biogenesis.</p>
        <p>The similarity in phenotypes among animals defective in collagen and cuticle biosynthesis compared with the RNAi Duox animals suggested that Duox participates in cuticle biogenesis. To confirm this hypothesis, EM was carried out on wild-type and RNAi animals. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>
, cuticle of RNAi Duox animals was grossly abnormal. In normal animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A), three cuticle layers are seen clearly: the cortical (outer), median, and basal (inner) layer as described previously (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al<italic>.,</italic> 1981</xref>). The median layer is composed of struts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, arrows) connecting the cortical and basal layers with a fluid-filled space between these layers. The RNAi animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>) frequently showed separation between the cortical and the basal layers with marked expansion of the fluid cavity and broken and distended struts that are still visible on these layers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B, arrows). These separations occurred mainly over bundles of muscle fiber (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>) and are likely to account for the formation of the blisters seen by light microscopy. Thus, the cuticle structure was severely affected in RNAi Duox animals.</p>

        <title>Absence of tyrosine cross-linking in RNAi nematodes</title>
        <p>Cross-linking of collagen and other cuticle proteins in nematodes occurs through di- and trityrosine linkages, which bridge and stabilize the proteinaceous structure (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fetterer and Rhoads, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fetterer et al., 1993</xref>). Because peroxidases such as sea urchin ovoperoxidase and human MPO carry out this reaction (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">LaBella et al., 1968</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Malanik and Ledvina, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Deits et al., 1984</xref>), we hypothesized that the function of Ce-Duox1 (and possibly Ce-Duox2) is to generate tyrosine cross-links and that the defective cuticle in the Ce-Duox RNAi animals is due to an inability to form tyrosine cross-links. A role for an unknown peroxidase in tyrosine cross-linking in <italic>Ascaris</italic> was suggested previously based on studies in which tyrosine cross-linking activity was inhibited using the peroxidase inhibitors 4-amino-2,3,4 aminotriazole, phenylhydrazine, and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl tyrosine (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fetterer et al., 1993</xref>). We therefore examined the wild-type and Ce-Duox1/2 RNAi knockout animals for di- and trityrosine linkages. An HPLC profile of an acid hydrolysate of the wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> is shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>
, trace A. The first large peak was identified as dityrosine based on comparison with authentic standard and mass spectral analysis, and the second peak is identified as trityrosine based on its migration on HPLC relative to dityrosine and mass spectral analysis. Based on peak areas and assuming equivalent ionization, dityrosine and tyrosine were present in a ratio of 1:200 in adult wild-type animals. In addition, the fluorescence excitation/emission maxima were determined at alkaline and acidic pH and were in good agreement with previously reported values (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 1996</xref>). Mass spectral analysis of purified <italic>C. elegans</italic> cuticle and noncuticular material determined that &gt;99.99% of dityrosine and trityrosine are located in cuticle material, since dityrosine was undetectable in the noncuticle fraction (unpublished data). Dityrosine and trityrosine peaks were absent in hydrolysates of Ce-Duox RNAi nematodes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, trace B). Thus, interference with the expression of Ce-Duox1 eliminates formation of di- and trityrosine linkages.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The topology model shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>
is proposed for Duox based on its primary structure and on analogy with known features of gp91<italic>phox</italic>. In activated phagocytes, gp91<italic>phox</italic> is integrally associated with the plasma membrane. The COOH-terminal half of gp91<italic>phox</italic> is homologous to known FAD proteins (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rotrosen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Segal et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sumimoto et al., 1992</xref>) and contains a predicted NADPH-binding site. This region is thus likely to fold into a discrete intracellular flavoprotein domain. Gp91<italic>phox</italic> also contains an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal hydrophobic domain, comprising nearly half of the molecule. The corresponding region in Duox is predicted to cross the membrane six times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A), placing both the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus and the COOH terminus (attached to the flavoprotein domain) on the cytosolic side. Several features of the model have been verified for gp91<italic>phox</italic>. For example, the model places known glycosylation sites on the cell exterior (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wallach and Segal, 1997</xref>) and a binding loop for the cytosolic regulatory protein p47<italic>phox</italic> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Biberstine-Kinkade et al., 1999</xref>) on the cytosolic side.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The gp91<italic>phox</italic> homology domains in h-Duox1/2 and Ce-Duox1/2 show the same hydropathy profile and predicted transmembrane Î± helices as gp91<italic>phox</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, hashed bars within the gp91<italic>phox</italic> homology region). We therefore assume that the gp91<italic>phox</italic> transmembrane model will also apply to the COOH-terminal portion of the Duox proteins. Such a model predicts that the domain containing the EF-hands is on the interior of the cell. The presence of a secretion export signal peptide sequence at the extreme NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A) and the presence of an additional predicted transmembrane hydrophobic sequence intervening between the EF-hand domain and the peroxidase homology domain predicts that the peroxidase domain will reside on the exterior of the cell (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Although features of this model will need to be tested directly, this structure is attractive as it is consistent with the genetic and biochemical data, implicating Ce-Duox1 in the generation of extracellular tyrosine cross-links in cuticle proteins.</p>
      <p>The phagocyte NADPH-oxidase serves as a model for the function of the gp91<italic>phox</italic> homology domain of Duox. The gp91<italic>phox</italic> component of the phagocyte oxidase generates reactive oxygen outside of the cell or in the phagosome (which is topologically extracellular). NADPH reduces the FAD within the flavoprotein domain, and the FAD then passes electrons through the two heme groups located within the transmembrane NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of gp91<italic>phox</italic>, reducing oxygen to form superoxide outside of the cell with secondary production of hydrogen peroxide by dismutation. Such a function has been demonstrated for p138<sup>Tox</sup> (Duox2), which was purified as the hydrogen peroxideâgenerating NADPH oxidase from thyroid (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dupuy et al<italic>.</italic>, 1999</xref>). These authors proposed that p138<sup>Tox</sup> functions to provide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to thyroid peroxidase, which is known to iodinate the thyroid hormone precursor. A recent study (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">De Deken et al., 2000</xref>) identified a peroxidase homology domain in Duox1 and Duox2 (ThOX1 and ThOX2), but the authors suggested that this domain was inactive based on an absence of putative catalytically important residues.</p>
      <p>Oxidative reactions are generally thought to be deleterious to the cell, but the results of the current study suggest that protein oxidation by peroxidases plays a critical role in normal physiology. Insights into the function of the Duox peroxidase domain come from the phagocyte system in which cell activation is accompanied by both activation of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase and secretion of MPO. Hydrogen peroxide generated indirectly by the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase combines with chloride in an oxidation catalyzed by MPO to form hypochlorous acid, a species which functions in bactericidal reactions. In the case of Duox enzymes, both the NADPH-oxidase moiety and the peroxidase moiety are integrated into a single molecule. The hydrogen peroxide generated by the gp91<italic>phox</italic>-homology domain in Duox should then serve as a substrate for the peroxidase domain. For Ce-Duox1, the cosubstrate is protein tyrosine residues, which are converted to di- and trityrosine presumably via a reaction involving the tyrosyl radical based on mechanisms established for other well-studied peroxidases; tyrosyl radical recombination would generate di- and trityrosine, resulting in protein cross-linking to stabilize the nematode cuticle. Peroxidases including human MPO (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Heinecke et al., 1993</xref>) and the sea urchin ovoperoxidase (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Deits et al., 1984</xref>) catalyze this tyrosine cross-linking, albeit in the former case somewhat inefficiently. Thus, the proposed topological structure of Duox is well suited to support transmembrane peroxidative reaction using intracellular reducing equivalents from NADPH.</p>
      <p>Precedent for the involvement of a peroxidase in extracellular matrix structure comes from the fertilization reaction in sea urchin oocytes. Fertilization results in activation of tyrosine cross-linking of extracellular proteins in the oocyte, forming a protective fertilization envelope (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Deits et al<italic>.</italic> 1984</xref>). This reaction is catalyzed by ovoperoxidase, a peroxidase secreted by the oocyte. In this system, the hydrogen peroxide is generated by an unknown NADPH-oxidase. Thus, in the case of the sea urchin oocyte individual proteins carry out the peroxide generation and the peroxidative functions respectively. Yeast spore coats also contain dityrosine cross-links that are formed by a heme protein (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Briza et al<italic>.</italic> 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>The closest known structural homologues of h-Duox1/2 are Ce-Duox1 and Ce-Duox2. Both h-Duox1/2 and Ce-Duox1 show the same domain structure, including the gp91<italic>phox</italic> homology domain, the EF-hand domain, and the peroxidase domain. In the case of h-Duox1/2, the critical calcium-binding residues in the EF-hand domain are well conserved, suggesting a role for calcium in the regulation of the enzyme activity. This has been proposed to account for the calcium dependence for the NADPH-oxidase activity of p138<sup>Tox</sup> (Duox2), (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dupuy et al<italic>.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In contrast, the calcium-binding ligands in the EF-hand regions in Ce-Duox1/2 are poorly conserved, suggesting that calcium may not be involved at this site. Calcium-binding regions within the peroxidase domain are well conserved in both Ce-Duox1/2 and h-Duox, suggesting a distinct role for calcium as has been noted for other peroxidases.</p>
      <p>The similarity between the peroxidase domain of Ce-Duox1 and h-Duox1/2 raises the possibility that their function will be similar. The peroxidase domains of h-Duox1/2 and Ce-Duox1 are 37% identical to one another, whereas the peroxidase domains of Duox proteins are only 19â20% identical with known mammalian peroxidases. Thus, among known peroxidases or peroxidase domains the h-Duox is most similar to Ce-Duox1, and this may imply similar catalytic specificities. Supporting this idea, biochemical data show that the recombinant-expressed peroxidase domains from human and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Duox are both capable of generating di- and trityrosine cross-links. This conservation of domain structure, sequence, and biochemical activity is suggestive of a similar function for Ce-Duox1 and h-Duox1/2. In addition, our data showing that Duox1 and Duox2 expression is not restricted to thyroid suggests that their function is not limited to a thyroid-specific function. In thyroid, the peroxidase domains of h-Duox1 and h-Duox2 may participate in iodination of thyroglobulin, the precursor of thyroxine. If this is the case, then the function is redundant to that of the well-characterized thyroid peroxidase (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Taurog, 1999</xref>). However, because other tissues in which Duox1/2 are expressed lack iodine uptake systems such a function in these tissues seems unlikely. In addition to iodination, mammalian Duox might also function in forming the ether bridge of thyroid hormone, a reaction that is analogous to pulcherosine synthesis.</p>
      <p>Is mammalian Duox involved in generation of tyrosine cross-links? Dityrosine cross-links stabilize several types of extracellular matrices including not only the cuticle of nematodes (above), but also insect elastomer resilin (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 1963</xref>), insect cuticle (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Locke, 1969</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Klebanoff et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Deits et al., 1984</xref>), the chorion envelope of <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Georgi and Deri, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Mindrinos et al., 1980</xref>), and the yeast acrospore wall (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Briza et al., 1996</xref>). The occurrence of dityrosine and a possible role in extracellular matrix in mammalian system is less well studied. In mammals, dityrosine is a marker of inflammation as occurs in low density lipoprotein isolated from atherosclerotic plaques (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Leeuwenburgh et al., 1997</xref>). Dityrosine is proposed to be formed during inflammation through the action of MPO secreted by inflammatory cells (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Zaitsu et al., 1981</xref>) or in the mouth by salivary lactoperoxidase (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Tenovuo and Paunio, 1979</xref>), but Duox-dependent mechanisms are not ruled out. A major constituent of extracellular matrix and basement membrane is collagen, and mammalian collagen has been reported previously to contain very low concentrations of dityrosine linkages (â¼1 in 100,000 tyrosines) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Keeley et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Waykole and Heidemann, 1976</xref>), in addition to the predominant cross-links involving lysines and histidines. However, such cross-linking may be nonspecifically associated with aging or artifactually induced during sample preparation. Dityrosine linkages have been isolated from other structural proteins and hard tissues such as elastin (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">LaBella et al., 1967</xref>), fibrin and keratin (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Raven et al., 1971</xref>), and cataractous human lens protein (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Castineiras et al., 1978</xref>). In elastin, although the predominant cross-link involves lysine it has been speculated that the tyrosine cross-links may be critical at early stages of elastin biogenesis and that this is followed later by extensive cross-linking at lysines (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">LaBella et al., 1967</xref>). Low concentrations of tyrosine cross-links might help order and align elastin and/or collagen fibrils, aligning further high abundance cross-linking at lysines. Such a role for human Duox is attractive and is consistent with its expression in lung, which possesses a high content of elastin. To our knowledge, dityrosine linkages in mammalian basement membrane or extracellular matrix other than collagen and elastin have not been described, perhaps owing to a lack of sufficient quantities of material for analysis. In addition, another peroxidase-catalyzed cross-link is formed from the deamination of protein lysyl Îµ-amino groups to form lysyl aldehydes, which then react with amino acid residues of adjacent molecules (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stahmann et al<italic>.</italic>, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al<italic>.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hazen et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that h-Duox generates this type of extracellular matrix cross-link. Its transmembrane nature and results from RNAi studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> support the hypothesis that this enzyme participates in the formation or modification of extracellular protein matrix.</p>

        <p>A 0.5-ml LB overnight culture of cells containing plasmid with the peroxidase domain from h-Duox or Ce-Duox was used to inoculate 50 ml of modified TB medium (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sandhu et al., 1993</xref>) containing 0.5 mM Î´-aminolevulinic acid, 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin, and 25 Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol in a 250-ml flask. Bacteria were grown at 37Â°C in a shaker at 200 RPM until the cell density measured 0.7 OD at 600 nm. Isopropyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM) was added, and the culture was continued at 25Â°C for 24 h at 150 RPM. Cells were pelleted at 4,500 <italic>g</italic> and resuspended in PBS containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesufnyl fluoride (2 Î¼M), bestatin (130 nM), trans-epoxysuccinyl-<sc>l</sc>-leucyl-amido(4-guanidino)butane (1.4 nM), leupeptin (1 nM), and aprotinin (0.3 nM). The cell suspension was then sonicated on ice.</p>

        <title>Activity assays</title>
        <p>The TMB liquid substrate system (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to assay peroxidase activity (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al<italic>.,</italic> 1974</xref>). 100 Î¼g of lysate protein from cells expressing either the human Duox1 peroxidase domain, Ce-Duox1 peroxidase domain, or a vector control was added to 1-ml aliquots of the TMB substrate system. The peroxidase reactions were performed in triplicate, and activity was monitored at 655 nm with a Beckman Coulter DU640B spectrophotometer. Some samples contained 30 Î¼M aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, a peroxidase inhibitor (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kettle et al<italic>.</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p>
        <p>To assay tyrosine cross-linking, tyrosine ethyl ester (20 mM) was dissolved in 10 ml of PBS buffer supplemented with 80 Î¼l of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. 100 Î¼g of <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate protein was added to 1-ml aliquots, samples were incubated for 1 h, and the reaction was quenched using an equal volume of 12 M HCl. Samples were analyzed for di- and trityrosine as above.</p>
