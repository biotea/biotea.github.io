        <p>The RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase deltex3L regulates ubiquitination of ESCRT-0 and endosomal sorting of CXCR4 by inhibiting the activity of the HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>G proteinâcoupled receptor (GPCR) sorting into the degradative pathway is important for limiting the duration and magnitude of signaling. Agonist activation of the GPCR CXCR4 induces its rapid ubiquitination and sorting to lysosomes via the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. We recently reported that ESCRT-0 ubiquitination is linked to the efficiency with which CXCR4 is sorted for lysosomal degradation; however mechanistic insight is lacking. Here we define a novel role for the really interesting new geneâdomain E3 ubiquitin ligase deltex-3-like (DTX3L) in regulating CXCR4 sorting from endosomes to lysosomes. We show that DTX3L localizes to early endosomes upon CXCR4 activation and interacts directly with and inhibits the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase atrophin-1 interacting protein 4. This serves to limit the extent to which ESCRT-0 is ubiquitinated and is able to sort CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation. Therefore we define a novel role for DTX3L in GPCR endosomal sorting and reveal an unprecedented link between two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases to control the activity of the ESCRT machinery.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>G proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the cellular responses of most hormones and neurotransmitters. GPCR signaling is under tight regulatory control, and any perturbations may be deleterious (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In general, upon ligand binding, GPCRs are rapidly phosphorylated and internalized through clathrin-coated pits via a Î²-arrestinâdependent pathway to early endosomes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Moore <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2007</xref>). On endosomes, GPCRs are sorted into either a recycling or a degradative pathway (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hanyaloglu and von Zastrow, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2008</xref>). GPCRs that sort into the recycling pathway restore the cell surface complement of receptors accessible to ligand, thereby contributing to functional recovery of hormonal responsiveness. GPCRs that sort into the degradative pathway are targeted for lysosomal degradation, leading to loss in total receptor complement and long-term attenuation of signaling. Proper endosomal sorting is necessary to ensure appropriate GPCR signaling, but mechanistic insight is lacking.</p><p>Direct modification of GPCRs by ubiquitin is required for targeting many GPCRs into the degradative pathway (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Shenoy, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hislop and von Zastrow, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Marchese and Trejo, 2013</xref>). This has been well characterized for the chemokine receptor CXCR4, in which ubiquitination of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues is necessary for its sorting to lysosomes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Marchese and Benovic, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bhandari <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Sorting of ubiquitinated CXCR4 from early endosomes to lysosomes occurs via the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Marchese, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Malerod <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Valiathan and Resh, 2008</xref>). The ESCRT pathway comprises four multisubunit protein complexes (ESCRT-0âIII) and the AAA Vps4 complex, which act in a concerted manner to direct ubiquitinated cargo into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which then fuse with lysosomes, where degradation occurs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gruenberg and Stenmark, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Piper and Katzmann, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hurley, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Henne <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Initial recognition of ubiquitinated cargo such as CXCR4 for targeting into ILVs is mediated by ESCRT-0 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bilodeau <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Katzmann <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Slagsvold <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). ESCRT-0 comprises two subunitsâhepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) and signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM)âand is localized to endosomal membranes in part via its ability to bind selectively to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), an endosomally enriched phospholipid, via the FYVE domain in HRS (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Stenmark <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Both ESCRT-0 subunits HRS and STAM have ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bilodeau <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Prag <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Ren and Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Henne <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>), and because ESCRT-0 can exist as heterotetrameric complexes on endosomal membranes, it is possible that ESCRT-0 might bind several ubiquitin moieties simultaneously (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mayers <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). On binding and recruitment of cargo, ESCRT-0 then recruits ESCRT-I, followed by other elements of the sorting machinery, which ultimately leads to sorting of the ubiquitinated cargo into ILVs (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Henne <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A common feature of ubiquitin-binding proteins is that they are also subject to monoubiquitination (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Polo <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>) via a mechanism referred to as coupled monoubiquitination that involves their own UBD (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Woelk <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Both ESCRT-0 subunits HRS and STAM are subject to monoubiquitination. HRS ubiquitination is predicted to inhibit its sorting activity, possibly by inducing an autoinhibitory conformation such that the ubiquitin moiety is believed to interact with its own UBD in either a <italic>cis</italic>- or a <italic>trans</italic>-acting manner, thus preventing ESCRT-0 from recognizing ubiquitinated cargo and performing its sorting function (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoeller <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Activated CXCR4 induces ubiquitination of HRS and STAM, suggesting that CXCR4 regulates its own down-regulation by regulating the ubiquitination status of the sorting machinery. We showed that when HRS ubiquitination is blocked, CXCR4 sorting to lysosomes is enhanced (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Marchese, 2010</xref>). However, this process remains poorly understood.</p><p>The E3 ubiquitin ligase atrophin-1 interacting protein 4 (AIP4) mediates ubiquitination of ESCRT-0 and CXCR4 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003b</xref>). AIP4 and its mouse orthologue, Itch, belong to the Nedd4 family of homologous to the E6AP carboxy terminus (HECT)âdomain E3 ubiquitin ligases and mediate ubiquitination of a diverse set of proteins involved in discrete cellular processes (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</xref>). AIP4 is believed to exist in an autoinhibitory conformation that may be relieved by either phosphorylation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>) or proteinâprotein binding (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>). AIP4 interacts with and regulates the stability or activity of other E3 ligases. AIP4 interacts with deltex-1 (DTX1), a really interesting new gene (RING)âdomain E3 ubiquitin ligase, and mediates its ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, thereby controlling ligand-independent Notch signaling (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chastagner <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). AIP4 also interacts with Cbl-c, also a RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, which act synergistically in mediating ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Courbard <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Whether these ligases regulate AIP4-dependent ubiquitination and/or endosomal sorting of CXCR4 remains to be determined.</p><p>Here we show for the first time that the RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase deltex-3-like (DTX3L) regulates CXCR4 trafficking to lysosomes. On CXCR4 activation, DTX3L colocalizes with CXCR4 on early endosomes, where it interacts with AIP4 to regulate the ubiquitination status of ESCRT-0. Our data suggest that DTX3L regulates ESCRT-0 ubiquitination and its sorting activity by controlling AIP4 ligase activity, thereby titrating the amount of CXCR4 that is sorted for lysosomal degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>DTX3L mediates CXCR4 degradation</title><p>The deltex (DTX) family of ubiquitin ligases comprises three closely related proteins (DTX1â3) and a distantly related protein known as deltex-3-like (DTX3L). Members of the DTX family of proteins are mainly known for their role in Notch signaling (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Matsuno <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yamada <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). DTX ubiquitin ligases have a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal RING domain (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). DTX1 and DTX2 possess a central proline-rich region (PRR) and a basic N-terminal region that binds to intracellular Notch ankyrin repeats. In contrast, DTX3 and DTX3L contain a unique N-terminus and lack the central proline-rich region; however, DTX3 and DTX3L are highly homologous to the other DTX family proteins within the C-terminal RING domain (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). To examine whether the DTX proteins regulate lysosomal trafficking of CXCR4, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to determine whether these ligases are involved in agonist-induced degradation of CXCR4. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed against DTX family members, and degradation of endogenous CXCR4 was examined by immunoblot analysis in cells treated with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) or 10 nM CXCL12 for 3 h. Consistent with our previously published data (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003b</xref>), siRNA directed against AIP4 inhibits agonist-induced CXCR4 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Agonist-induced degradation of CXCR4 was significantly inhibited in cells transfected with siRNA directed against DTX3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, siRNA directed against DTX1-3 had no effect on CXCR4 degradation (unpublished data). These data indicate that DTX3L mediates CXCR4 degradation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>A role for DTX3L in CXCR4 degradation. (A) HeLa cells transfected with siRNA directed against control, AIP4, or DTX3L were treated with vehicle (PBS + 0.1% BSA) or 10 nM CXCL12 for 3 h.

In vehicle-treated cells, DTX3L distribution is mainly diffuse, although a fraction also shows a punctate distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and B</xref>). In cells treated with CXCL12, the number of DTX3L puncta significantly increased compared with vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and B</xref>). To determine the identity of these DTX3L-containing vesicles, we costained HeLa cells for the early endosomal and late endosomal/lysosomal markers early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), respectively. There was a significant increase in the number of DTX3L puncta that colocalized with EEA1 upon CXCL12 treatment compared with vehicle, as determined by calculating the Pearson productâmoment correlation coefficient, suggesting that DTX3L is recruited to early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and C</xref>). The amount of DTX3L colocalizing with LAMP2 was not affected by CXCL12 treatment, indicating that DTX3L localization to lysosomes is not dependent upon CXCR4 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and D</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>DTX3L localizes to early endosomes upon CXCR4 activation.

To determine this, we examined the distribution of endogenous CXCR4 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in control or DTX3L siRNAâtransfected cells treated with vehicle or CXCL12 for 3 h. In vehicle-treated cells, CXCR4 was localized mainly to the plasma membrane in both control and DTX3L siRNA-treated cells (unpublished data), similar to what we previously reported (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Marchese, 2010</xref>). On agonist treatment, in control siRNAâtreated cells, CXCR4 significantly colocalized with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP2 and only partially colocalized with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, in DTX3L siRNAâtreated cells, CXCR4 significantly colocalized with EEA1 and not LAMP2, indicating that trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes was impaired in DTX3L-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with this, there were significantly more CXCR4 puncta in DTX3L-depleted cells than with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that CXCR4 was not degraded.

Because AIP4 and DTX3L interact, we next determined whether DTX3L regulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of AIP4. To examine this, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified AIP4, His-DTX3L, and their catalytically inactive mutants (AIP4-C830A; DTX3L-3C/A). The catalytically inactive mutants are unable to load ubiquitin directly (AIP4-C830A) or indirectly (DTXL3L-3C/A) and therefore serve as negative controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, AIP4 (lane 6, top) and DTX3L (lane 8, middle) self-ubiquitinate, which is a common feature of E3 ubiquitin ligases.

There was also a small decrease in DTX3L ubiquitination when DTX3L was coincubated with AIP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 10 vs. lane 8, middle). To confirm these results, we immunoblotted samples for ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom). The anti-ubiquitin immunoblot also shows less AIP4 self-ubiquitination when AIP4 was coincubated with DTX3L or DTX3L-3C/A. The anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) antibody recognizes AIP4 self-ubiquitination but not self-ubiquitination of DTX3L, likely because it does not have high affinity for chain linkages produced by DTX3L. Using N- and C-terminal truncations of full-length DTX3L, we were able to deduce the AIP4-binding region on DTX3L to lie within the N-terminal region beyond the DTX3L RING domain (Supplemental Figure S1B). This suggests that binding of AIP4 to the unique N-terminal region of DTX3L seems to be sufficient to prevent AIP4 ligase activity in vitro. Overall these data indicate that DTX3L inhibits AIP4 ligase activity independent of its catalytic activity, suggesting that the interaction of DTX3L with AIP4 inhibits its activity.</p><p>To further ensure that the decrease in AIP4 self-ubiquitination seen in the presence of DTX3L was not due to sequestration of ubiquitin, we performed similar in vitro ubiquitination experiments using the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, when AIP4 is incubated with Parkin, AIP4 self-ubiquitination is not inhibited compared with when it is incubated with DTX3L. In fact, AIP4 self-ubiquitination may be more efficient in the presence of Parkin due to the presence of highâmolecular weight species not present when it is incubated alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 8 vs. lane 5, top). This was further supported by the ubiquitin blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom). DTX3L self-ubiquitination was somewhat decreased in the presence of wild-type AIP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, A</xref>, lane 10, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>, lane 8) but was substantially decreased in the presence of Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 10). The reason for this remains to be investigated. Parkin self-ubiquitination was not impaired by AIP4 or DTX3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating specificity between AIP4 and DTX3L. Taken together, these data further support that DTX3L inhibits AIP4 ubiquitin ligase activity.</p><p>To determine whether DTX3L regulates AIP4 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells, we examined the ubiquitination status of HRS, an AIP4 substrate (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Marchese <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003b</xref>), in HeLa cells depleted of DTX3L or AIP4 alone or together. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, hyperubiquitination of HRS observed when DTX3L was depleted alone was suppressed when DTX3L and AIP4 were depleted simultaneously. These data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of DTX3L on AIP4 ligase activity in cells. DTX3L heterodimerizes with the related E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX1, leading to enhanced DTX1 and/or DTX3L ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In addition, AIP4 interacts with and mediates polyubiquitination of DTX1, thereby regulating the degradation of DTX1 in lysosomes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chastagner <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Our data here suggest that it is the interaction per se rather than ubiquitination of AIP4 by DTX3L that negatively affects AIP4 activity. AIP4 may exist in an autoinhibitory conformation, and typically phosphorylation or protein binding renders it active (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>). It is unclear how DTX3L binding to AIP4 may inhibit its activity, although it is conceivable that DTX3L may somehow prevent AIP4 from undergoing a conformational change. It is also possible that DTX3L inhibits AIP4 activity because it affects E2 binding to AIP4 and/or E2 ubiquitin loading. Further investigation will be required to determine this, but regardless of the mechanism, our data indicate that DTX3L attenuates AIP4 ligase activity in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Endosomal sorting is essential for regulating GPCR signaling. In this study we defined a novel role for the RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX3L in regulating endosomal sorting of the GPCR CXCR4. We showed that DTX3L controls CXCR4 sorting from early endosomes to lysosomes by regulating the ubiquitination status of ESCRT-0 subunits HRS and STAM-1. DTX3L does not directly mediate ubiquitination of HRS and STAM-1, but regulates their ubiquitination by inhibiting the HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4. Our data are consistent with a model in which, upon CXCR4 activation, endogenous DTX3L is recruited to early endosomes and interacts directly with AIP4 and antagonizes AIP4 ligase activity, thereby limiting the extent to which ESCRT-0 subunits are ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This maintains ESCRT-0 on early endosomes such that it is able to interact with ubiquitinated CXCR4 and sort it for lysosomal degradation. We propose that DTX3L regulates ESCRT-0 sorting activity and controls the amount of CXCR4 that is targeted for lysosomal degradation by serving as an endogenous inhibitor of AIP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). It is possible that DTX3L regulation of ESCRT-0 may be a general mechanism to regulate sorting of ubiquitinated cargo.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8:</label><caption><p>Proposed model for how ESCRT-0 ubiquitination regulates CXCR4 lysosomal sorting. 1) When both DTX3L and AIP4 are present, CXCR4 undergoes rapid agonist-induced lysosomal sorting and degradation. ESCRT-0 is moderately ubiquitinated as AIP4 activity is suppressed by DTX3L, and ESCRT-0 is able to efficiently sort ubiquitinated CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation. 2) When DTX3L levels are reduced by siRNA, AIP4 activity is NOT suppressed and it is able to hyperubiquitinate ESCRT-0. This renders ESCRT-0 nonfunctional because ESCRT-0 subunits HRS and STAM are unable to associate with each other and are no longer localized to endosomes; therefore ESCRT-0 is unable to sort ubiquitinated CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1892fig8"/></fig><p>DTX3L (also known as B lymphoma and BALâassociated protein [BBAP]) was first identified as a binding partner to the gene B aggressive lymphoma (BAL; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). BAL is not a DTX3L substrate, but when BAL1 interacts with DTX3L, it mediates its nuclear localization, where DTX3L has a role in the DNA damage response pathway by mediating monoubiquitination of histone H4 (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first report to describe a role for DTX3L in membrane trafficking. Our data show that DTX3L is mainly cytosolic, but upon CXCR4 activation, DTX3L colocalizes with early endosome marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). DTX3L also colocalizes with the late endosome and lysosomal marker LAMP2, but this colocalization does not change upon CXCR4 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These data are consistent with DTX3L being recruited to early endosomes upon CXCR4 activation and regulating sorting of CXCR4 to lysosomes. DTX3L may also have a role on late endosomes or lysosomes, but this remains to be investigated. Accordingly, in DTX3L-depleted cells, CXCR4 accumulates on early endosomes and does not traffic to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore we have defined a novel role for DTX3L in mediating endosomal sorting of CXCR4.</p><p>The recruitment of DTX3L to early endosomes may occur in concert with AIP4. On CXCR4 activation, FLAG-AIP4 and DTX3L localize to early endosomes at similar time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, C and D</xref>). We show here that DTX3L interacts directly with AIP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and they exist as a complex in cells that also includes ESCRT-0 subunits HRS and STAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore it is possible that AIP4 and, hence, DTX3L are recruited to early endosomes together via ESCRT-0. However, this is unlikely because in the wortmannin-treated cells, DTX3L was still present on early endosomes, whereas, conversely, the positive control YFP-2ÃFYVE (an ESCRT-0 reporter) showed almost no endosomal localization (Supplemental Figure S2). It remains to be determined how AIP4 and DTX3L are recruited to endosomes. DTX3L remained associated with early endosomes for up to 60 min after agonist treatment, whereas AIP4 showed very little endosomal association at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, DâF</xref>). Therefore, although AIP4 and DTX3L are recruited to early endosomes together, the retention of DTX3L on early endosomes is likely mediated by other factors. As a consequence, it is conceivable that DTX3L has additional roles at later steps in the sorting process.</p><p>Our study links the role of DTX3L on CXCR4 endosomal sorting to ESCRT-0 ubiquitination. In DTX3L-depleted cells, both HRS and STAM-1 are hyperubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). ESCRT-0 binds to ubiquitinated cargo such as CXCR4 via the multiple ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) in HRS and STAM-1 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bilodeau <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Prag <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Ren and Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Henne <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Monoubiquitination of HRS is predicted to induce an autoinhibitory conformation that prevents ESCRT-0 from interacting with ubiquitinated receptors, thereby inhibiting its endosomal sorting function (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoeller <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Here we show that ubiquitination also affects ESCRT-0 complex integrity and localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5, C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Hyperubiquitination of HRS and STAM-1 does not lead to their degradation because their levels do not change in DTX3L-depleted cells, and therefore ubiquitination likely regulates endosomal localization of ESCRT-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). ESCRT-0 localizes to early endosomes in part via the PI3P-binding FYVE domain of HRS (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2001</xref>). However, loss of ESCRT-0 from endosomes is not due to a decrease in the steady-state endosomal levels of PI3P, as depletion of DTX3L does not affect YFP-2ÃFYVE domain puncta, used here as a reporter to monitor PI3P levels in cells (Supplemental Figure S2). However, it is possible that multiple ubiquitin moieties and/or polyubiquitin chains attached to HRS and/or STAM-1 could render ESCRT-0 less able to bind to PI3P, leading to its removal from endosomal membranes and its destabilization. Our data contrast with what has been observed in yeast cells, where ubiquitination of Vps27, the orthologue of HRS, does not affect ESCRT-0 sorting activity, as sorting of ubiquitinated cargo remains intact when Vps27 ubiquitination is impaired (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Stringer and Piper, 2011</xref>). A recent study suggested that HRS ubiquitination is linked to impaired lysosomal sorting of EGFR, which is similar to what we observe here for CXCR4 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2013</xref>). It is possible that yeast and mammalian ESCRT-0 are differentially regulated by ubiquitination, possibly by additional factors that have an effect on its sorting activity.</p><p>Our data indicate that DTX3L regulates ESCRT-0 ubiquitination by inhibiting the activity of AIP4. Hyperubiquitination of HRS in DTX3L-depleted cells is suppressed when AIP4 is also depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). DTX3L likely inhibits AIP4 via an interaction, as both active and catalytically inactive DTX3L inhibit AIP4 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that DTX3L may serve as an endogenous inhibitor of AIP4. DTX3L therefore may have an effect on other AIP4 substrates. CXCR4 is also ubiquitinated by AIP4, and we also observed increased ubiquitination of CXCR4 in DTX3L-depleted cells (Supplemental Figure S3). Typically, increased ubiquitination of CXCR4 should promote its degradation and not inhibit it; however, because ESCRT-0 function is attenuated in DTX3L-depleted cells, CXCR4 is unable to be sorted to lysosomes and therefore accumulates on early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This reinforces the fact that endosomal sorting represents a critical step in targeting GPCRs for lysosomal degradation.</p><p>AIP4 has been shown to interact with other RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligases, including DTX1, Cbl-c, and RNF11. AIP4 interacts with Cbl-c, and they act synergistically in mediating ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of EGFR (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Courbard <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Further, although AIP4 interacts with RNF11, to our knowledge, the functional significance of this interaction remains unknown (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kitching <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Recently, RNF11 was physically linked to ESCRT-0 and lysosomal degradation of EGFR, but the mechanism remains to be determined (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kostaras <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, AIP4 interacts with DTX1 and mediates its ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chastagner <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). DTX3L also interacts with DTX1, resulting in greater activity of each E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In contrast, our data reveal that AIP4 and DTX3L have less activity when they interact, which affects ubiquitination of AIP4 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, A and C</xref>). Whether DTX3L has substrates relevant to GPCR endosomal sorting remains to be determined. We did observe an overall increase in the total level of ubiquitination in cells depleted of DTX3L, as assessed by immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5, A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and Supplemental Figure S3). This could be linked to enhanced ubiquitination of AIP4 substrates in addition to HRS and CXCR4, which we report here, but this remains to be examined. Alternatively, DTX3L may have a general inhibitory effect on cellular ubiquitination, but this seems unlikely, given that DTX3L does not inhibit DTX1 activity (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, histone H4 is the only identified DTX3L substrate (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p>ESCRT-0 ubiquitination is also regulated by DUBs. AMSH and USP8 are endosomally localized DUBs that regulate the ubiquitination status of HRS or STAM (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Berlin <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sierra <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Depletion of USP8 by siRNA enhances HRS ubiquitination and inhibits CXCR4 degradation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Berlin <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Depletion of AMSH by siRNA does not affect CXCR4 degradation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Marchese, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sierra <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>), but expression of AMSH dominant-negative constructs enhances HRS or STAM ubiquitination and inhibits CXCR4 degradation (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sierra <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>). It is possible that DTX3L could be regulating these DUBs, which, when DTX3L is depleted, would be less active, leading to hyperubiquitination of ESCRT-0. However, in AMSH- or USP8-depleted cells, HRS and STAM-1 still colocalize with endosomes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Berlin <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sierra <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>), in contrast to when DTX3L is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). AMSH and USP8 have been linked to later stages of endosomal sorting (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Clague <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2012</xref>), but whether this could have an effect on ESCRT-0 endosomal localization remains to be determined. Of interest, DTX3L appears to have the opposite effect on ESCRT-0 ubiquitination than Î²-arrestin-1 (also known as arrestin-2; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Marchese, 2010</xref>). Î²-Arrestin-1 interacts with ESCRT-0 subunit STAM-1 to promote HRS ubiquitination (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Marchese, 2010</xref>). Therefore there may a balance between DTX3L and Î²-arrestin action on AIP4 that regulates the ubiquitination status of ESCRT-0 and thereby dictates the amount of CXCR4 sorted for degradation.</p><p>This study reveals for the first time a novel role for the RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX3L in endocytic trafficking. This is distinct from its other known function in the DNA damage response pathway (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). DTX3L has been linked to diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Juszczynski <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Of interest, high levels of CXCR4 are also found in multiple lymphomas, including DLBCL (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arai <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2000</xref>), and, recently, CXCR4 expression levels were shown to correlate with distinct DLBCL subtypes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Deutsch <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In future studies, it will be interesting to examine whether DTX3L via CXCR4 may be linked to DLBCL and other CXCR4-dependent diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>HeLa cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

To generate the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) truncations of DTX3L, primers were made based on the DTX3L truncations previously published (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Takeyama <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Briefly, the NT truncation of DTX3L spans amino acids 1â464, and the CT truncation covers amino acids 528â740. Full-length GST-DTX3L was used as a template in the PCR, and PCR products were subcloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites of pGEX-6P-1. The DTX3L-3C/A mutant was designed based on a DTX1 mutant previously reported (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chastagner <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Briefly, cysteine residues 561, 596, and 599 within the RING domain were mutated to alanine residues using two-step PCR and subcloned into pET-21a(+) as described for wild-type DTX3L. The FLAG-tagged AIP4-C830A mutant was made by digesting myc-AIP4-C830A-pRK5 with <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI and subcloning and replacing the equivalent fragment in 3ÃFLAG-pCMV-10-AIP4.

We tested several antibodies directed against AIP4 but were unable to detect endogenous AIP4 by immunofluorescence microscopy, and therefore we transiently expressed FLAG-AIP4 to approximately twofold over endogenous levels, as determined by immunoblotting, to study AIP4 distribution in HeLa cells. Cells were washed and mounted on glass slides using mounting medium containing 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apo 63Ã/1.4 numerical aperture oil lens objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired using a 1.4-megapixel, cooled extended spectral range RGB digital camera set at 512 Ã 512 resolution. Equal acquisition settings (gain and intensity) were used between parallel samples within each experiment. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (version 1.37v; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Photoshop (CS4; Adobe, San Jose, CA). The Pearson productâmoment correlation coefficient was determined using the ImageJ plug-in Colocalization Finder. Pixels were restrained to the minimum ratio of 75% to reduce noise from channel bleedthrough. Analysis results in values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represents no colocalization and 1 represents absolute colocalization. Puncta analysis was performed using the Analyze Particles macro in ImageJ. Images (8-bit) were manually thresholded to minimum (130â150) and maximum (250) values to exclude background noise.
