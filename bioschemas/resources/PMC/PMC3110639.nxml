        <p id="P1">The ciliopathy Joubert syndrome is marked by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, a phenotype for which the pathogenic mechanism is unclear<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In order to investigate Joubert syndrome pathogenesis, we have examined mice with mutated <italic>Ahi1</italic>, the first identified Joubert syndrome gene<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These mice exhibit cerebellar hypoplasia with a vermis/midline fusion defect early in development.

Further, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from human subjects with Joubert syndrome reveals a similar midline cleft suggesting parallel pathogenic mechanisms. Previous evidence has suggested a role for Jouberin (Jbn), the protein encoded by <italic>Ahi1</italic>, in canonical Wnt signaling<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we found decreased Wnt reporter activity at the site of hemisphere fusion in the developing cerebellum of <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant mice. This decrease was accompanied by reduced proliferation at the site of fusion. Finally, treatment with lithium, a Wnt pathway agonist<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, partially rescued this phenotype.

    <p id="P2">Joubert syndrome is a developmental disorder marked by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and a unique molar tooth sign on imaging (MTI)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and is part of a larger spectrum of disorders known as ciliopathies. Although the primary cilium seems to be involved in pathogenesis of these disorders, its exact function within this context is not clear. Some hints have come from conditional cilia mouse mutants which exhibit similar ciliopathy phenotypes, including cerebellar hypoplasia<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. However, the resulting cerebellar phenotypes appear more severe than those seen in Joubert syndrome, suggesting a more specific defect may be to blame in the human disease. Recent evidence has identified several key signaling pathways that rely on or are regulated by cilia, such as Wnt and Shh signaling<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Since mouse mutants for genes null mutated in Joubert syndrome have not yet been examined for cerebellar phenotypes, the mechanism of Joubert syndrome pathogenesis in cerebellar vermis formation is still not clear.</p>
    <p id="P3">In order to study mechanisms of Joubert syndrome pathogenesis, we examined a mouse model of loss of function of <italic>Ahi1</italic>, mutated in Joubert syndrome and encoding the Jbn protein<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Adult <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice exhibited smaller body size as reported previously<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> with slightly reduced brain size compared with <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> or <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, which were indistinguishable from each other. Overall brain morphology of <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice appeared normal except for a smaller cerebellum and underdeveloped vermis with a mildly defective foliation pattern<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Vermian lobules VI and VII appeared fused while lobule V appeared smaller and underdeveloped at 3 weeks of age. Overall, the cerebellum appeared slightly hypoplastic suggesting a developmental defect that may be similar to Joubert syndrome though much less severe in the mouse.</p>
    <p id="P4">We next examined cresyl-violet stained midline sagittal sections which revealed that although the overall brain size was reduced by 17% compared with controls (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) the cerebellar vermis appeared more severely affected as it was reduced by 40% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and this decrease was more statistically significant when corrected for total brain size, which decreased the variance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, foliation defects in lobules V, VI and VII were also visible on sagittal sections similar to that seen on whole-mount (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice consistently displayed an average decrease in number of folia of 1.5 compared with littermate controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, these size and foliation defects persisted beyond three weeks, throughout adulthood (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Although the MTI is present in humans with Joubert syndrome, no evidence of this sign was present in mouse mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, other defects described in Joubert syndrome such as fragmentation of deep cerebellar nuclei and structural anomalies of the descending trigeminal tract and brainstem nuclei<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> were not evident in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c, d</xref>). Decussation of pyramidal axons, which can be abnormal in humans with Joubert syndrome<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, also appeared normal in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Furthermore, despite the cerebellar defects, cellular organization and layering appeared normal in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant mice compared with littermate controls (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Additionally, staining for the Purkinje neuron marker Calbindin and the granule neuron marker GABA-A receptor Î±6 revealed intact cell fate and layering (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Finally, Golgi-Cox stain revealed normal neuronal morphology within the adult cerebellum of mutant mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">We next examined cerebellar development in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants. At postnatal day five (P5), transverse sections revealed a vermal foliation defect with an overall smaller vermis in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Similarly, sagittal sections at P4 revealed a smaller cerebellar vermis size and underdeveloped foliation with lobules V, VI and VII most affected (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). At E18.5, a very subtle size defect was evident (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The size defect was also quantified at E18.5 and P4 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Since both foliation and size are dependent upon expansion of cerebellar neurons, this phenotype could be due to defects in proliferation. We therefore tested BrdU staining in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) of the developing cerebellar midline. We examined several stages from E16.5 to P5 and detected a significant decrease in CGN BrdU staining within the vermis at E16.5, which recovered by E18.5 and remained equivalent at most postnatal time points, though a slight but significant decrease was evident at P5 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). However, isolated P5 CGNs from <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and control mice did not exhibit a difference when labeled with BrdU <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). The proliferation defect at E16.5 could also be detected by phospho-histone H3 staining <italic>in vivo</italic> to detect cells in mitosis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). This suggests a relatively early defect in proliferation of CGN precursors.</p>
    <p id="P8">One of the major regulatory pathways in CGN proliferation is Shh signaling; however, this pathway is primarily active at postnatal time points<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Since cilia regulate Shh signaling, and Joubert syndrome is a ciliopathy, we nevertheless tested for a Shh defect in these mice. We stained sections from P2 <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> littermates for N-myc, a proliferative gene target of Shh signaling (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). N-myc staining appeared strongest in CGNs, as reported previously<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and was not decreased in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cerebella. Furthermore, western blot analysis of N-myc protein levels from whole cerebellum lysates at P3 revealed equal levels in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mouse cerebellum compared with littermate control (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). We also stained for an independent Shh target gene, Patched (Ptc1), and observed similar levels of expression in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Finally, we performed qRT-PCR for three Shh target genes: N-Myc, Gli1, and Ptc1, and did not observe any differences in expression in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice compared with littermate controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). We can therefore conclude that postnatal Shh signaling appears intact in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant cerebella. We further tested Shh signaling at earlier time points as described below.</p>
    <p id="P9">Given the early proliferation defect, we next examined morphology of the developing cerebellum at earlier embryonic stages. Transverse sections from <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> embryos revealed a striking midline fusion defect at the cerebellar vermis primordium compared with control littermates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This defect was most evident at E16.5 when control vermis had nearly completely fused whereas <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> vermis was thinner and malformed. The defect was also clearly visible at E14.5 in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> brain compared with control littermate. Whole mount images of embryos at E12.5 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) also revealed a separation of developing cerebellar hemispheres at the midline with expansion of the rhombic roof plate.</p>
    <p id="P10">To further examine this roof plate abnormality, we examined sagittal sections from an independent set of E12.5 embryonic brains (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Serial midline and paramedial sections revealed a lengthened roof plate in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> brain compared with littermate control. Furthermore, transverse sections at E13.5 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) revealed an overall widened roof plate in the <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant as visualized by serial sections from anterior to posterior. Matched anterior sections at the site of cerebellar hemisphere fusion revealed defective fusion in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant brain compared with control. These findings suggest the cerebellar phenotype may be a result of defective midline fusion with expansion of the roof plate, likely a secondary effect of incomplete growth of midline cerebellar tissue.</p>
    <p id="P11">Since these studies were aimed at modeling Joubert syndrome, we tested whether these findings were also apparent in an alternate Joubert syndrome model: null mice for <italic>Cep290</italic>, the second gene positionally cloned in Joubert syndrome<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Because the only published <italic>Cep290</italic> mutant mouse is the <italic>rd16</italic> line, an in frame deletion without a cerebellum defect<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we decided to target <italic>Cep290</italic> to completely inactivate the gene. We generated <italic>Cep290</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice by targeted homologous recombination (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Although Cep290 has been described as a key cilia protein in other contexts<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, <italic>Cep290</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice appeared overall healthy with some runting and a retinal phenotype as in <italic>rd16</italic> mice (data not shown). We nevertheless examined E16.5 <italic>Cep290</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice for possible midline fusion defects. Similar to <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants, <italic>Cep290</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice exhibited defective midline fusion at E16.5 that was slightly milder than the <italic>Ahi1</italic> phenotype (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Additionally, adult <italic>Cep290</italic> mutants exhibited a mild foliation defect, although the vermis was not statistically smaller than controls (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">To test whether an early midline fusion defect may be a precursor to Joubert syndrome in humans, we examined fetal MRI from human subjects later verified to have Joubert syndrome. In human development, cerebellar hemispheres fuse at the midline by 13 weeks gestational age (GA) to eventually develop into the vermis<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We were able to obtain MRIs from three subjects with Joubert syndrome between 21 and 25 weeks GA when fusion should be complete. However, fetuses with Joubert syndrome exhibited a striking separation of cerebellar hemispheres at the midline when compared to control MRI (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Furthermore, this defect was most severe on inferior axial images where there was an apparent connection between the fourth ventricle and the cisterna magna. Similarly, in both <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> and <italic>Cep290</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, midline fusion appeared most defective on inferior (more posterior) transverse sections (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Finally, it is important to point out that 21â25 weeks GA in humans corresponds to a stage in cerebellar development after fusion occurs (13 weeks in humans, E13.5 in mice). Thus, although the human imaging is consistent with an early fusion defect, it may also be compatible with other early developmental defects leading up to the phenotype seen here. However, the similarities between the human and mouse phenotypes, and their common underlying genetics, suggest these findings are consistent with an early fusion defect in humans with Joubert syndrome.</p>
    <p id="P13">We next tested the function of several <italic>AHI1</italic> disease mutations to examine mechanisms of Joubert syndrome pathogenesis. We generated tagged plasmid based expression constructs encoding Jbn with one of three disease missense mutations: R723Q and H896R, in the WD40 domain, and V443D, adjacent to a putative atypical PKC phosphorylation site<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. These disease mutations each exhibited comparable protein expression levels to wild-type Jbn in 293T cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>) and mouse inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). We next examined localization and found that all three mutations failed to localize to the primary cilium compared with wild-type Jbn (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P14">Since Jbn has been identified as a positive modulator of canonical Wnt signaling<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, we next tested whether these disease mutation constructs were defective in modulation of Wnt activity. We performed luciferase assays with the Super Topflash Wnt reporter construct and treated cells with Wnt3A conditioned media. Overexpression of wild-type Jbn in these cells resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in reporter activity over vector control (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). In contrast, none of the mutants exhibited significantly increased Wnt activity compared with control.</p>
    <p id="P15">Since we previously reported that Jbn interacts with Î²-catenin<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, we tested the ability of GFP-tagged disease mutations to co-immunoprecipitate with Î²-catenin. This approach revealed an interaction between wild-type Jbn and Î²-catenin as well as an interaction with the R723Q and H896R mutations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). V443D however exhibited a considerable decrease in pulldown of endogenous Î²-catenin. Although soluble protein levels varied between mutant and wild-type Jbn constructs, immunoprecipitation efficiencies were indistinguishable among disease mutations, indicating a specific reduction in interaction between Î²-catenin and mutation V443D. Since V443 is adjacent to a putative atypical PKC phosphorylation site, this site may be important for Î²-catenin interaction.</p>
    <p id="P16">Since Joubert syndrome is a ciliopathy, we next tested whether Jbn localizes to cilia in CGNs. CGNs isolated from P5 wild-type mouse cerebella exhibited cilia during the first 24 hours following dissociation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Transfection with Jbn-GFP or staining for endogenous Jbn revealed localization to the basal body in CGNs. We additionally tested Î²-catenin colocalization by examining Î²-catenin-GFP and endogenous Î²-catenin, which exhibited colocalization with Jbn at the base of the cilium.</p>
    <p id="P17">These findings point to a possible role for the primary cilium in Jbnâs Wnt modulatory role. We therefore tested whether primary cilia were disrupted in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> CGNs. CGNs isolated from <italic>Ahi1</italic> null and control littermates exhibited indistinguishable number of cilia and morphology (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>) similar to that recently described in the kidney<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and retina<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> of <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. These results suggest that Jbn is not required for ciliogenesis but perhaps functions more specifically in ciliary-mediated signaling.</p>
    <p id="P18">Several canonical Wnt mouse mutants exhibit roof plate expansion and vermal defects<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Given Jbnâs previously described Wnt role, and our findings with disease mutations, we tested whether <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>mice exhibited defective Wnt signaling. We crossed <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> mice to Wnt reporter BATgal transgenic mice<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We previously reported that <italic>Ahi1</italic> and BATgal are genetically linked<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, in order to generate these mice, we performed backcrossings of <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup>; BATgal+ mice to <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> mice in order to recover mice with recombined alleles. Since midline fusion begins at approximately E13.5<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, we examined E13.5 <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup>; BATgal+ embryos for Wnt defects compared with <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup>; BATgal+ littermates. Whole mount imaging revealed a decrease in Wnt signaling at the cerebellar midline anlage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Further examination by transverse sectioning revealed a specific decrease in Wnt activity in cerebellar cells surrounding the midline in mutant tissue. We also examined Shh signaling during midline fusion, by staining for Gli1 and Ptc1. We observed very low-level expression of both factors, which appeared equally low in the <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). These results were not surprising since Shh has been described to be largely absent at this time and Shh defects have not been linked to cerebellar midline fusion defects.</p>
    <p id="P19">We next hypothesized that, since Wnt is a known mitogen, the tissue expansion at the midline may be due to a mitogenic role for Wnt signaling in this context. We examined proliferation of cerebellar precursors surrounding the site of fusion by performing BrdU pulse labeling. Control littermate embryos exhibited specific labeling of precursors immediately surrounding the fusion site while <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> embryos exhibited significantly fewer labeled cells in this region (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Furthermore, staining for Arl13b, a cilia marker, revealed a concentration of cilia at the site of fusion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>) suggesting Jbnâs role may be most important in these ciliated cells. However, cilia in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice appeared indistinguishable from those of littermate controls, consistent with a role for Jbn in ciliary signaling rather than ciliogenesis.</p>
    <p id="P20">We next performed a series of experiments using the Wnt agonist lithium to activate Wnt signaling<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. We performed intraperitoneal injections of LiCl, or NaCl as a control, in pregnant dams<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> at E12.5 and then again at E13.5 and examined E14.5 morphology. We also verified an increase in Wnt signaling with LiCl compared with those treated with NaCl (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). At E14.5, <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> receiving NaCl exhibited midline fusion defects as expected. However, <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>+/â</sup> and <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> embryos that received LiCl were indistinguishable from each other, suggesting a rescue of the phenotype (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, LiCl treated embryos exhibited expanded cerebellar hemisphere tissue with less of a separation between hemispheres, consistent with the hypothesis that canonical Wnt signaling promotes expansion of hemisphere tissue. However, fusion itself was not enhanced in embryos treated with LiCl suggesting a separate regulatory mechanism for this specific process of midline fusion.</p>
    <p id="P21">To quantify these effects, we measured extent of midline fusion and proliferation in embryos treated with LiCl. Pregnant dams were again injected with LiCl at E12.5 and E13.5 and embryos were examined at E14.5. We examined expansion of midline tissue by quantification of the size of the ventricular space between hemispheres from at least three mice of each genotype for each condition. This approach revealed a significantly larger inter-hemispheric space in untreated <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants compared with littermate control mice, while with lithium treatment there was no significant difference between mutants and controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). To examine proliferation in these mice, we additionally performed staining for Ki67, which revealed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells at the site of fusion of untreated <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> embryos compared with control littermates whereas lithium treatment rescued this phenotype (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P22">We next performed lithium treatments at E12.5 and E13.5 and examined morphology at later time points. At E16.5, midline morphology of <italic>Ahi1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> was indistinguishable from controls, reflecting intact midline fusion, though the lateral aspect still appeared slightly reduced in size (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Furthermore, mice examined after birth at P4, revealed a partial rescue of the size and foliation defects in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants, which more closely matched untreated controls compared with untreated mutants (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). However, mutant mice still exhibited runting and early postnatal lethality suggesting further treatment or other approaches may be needed to rescue this aspect the phenotype. Additionally, controls that received LiCl also exhibited slightly more advanced development of the vermis compared with untreated mice suggesting activation of Wnt signaling during midline fusion may enhance cerebellar development. Finally, examination of <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants at P11 revealed slightly more complex foliation and increased size with lithium treatment compared with untreated mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). Overall, we have examined five mutants at postnatal time points from P2 to P11 and observe a partial rescue of cerebellar developmental defects when treated with lithium.</p>
    <p id="P23">We describe for the first time two animal models of Joubert syndrome that provide the first indication that the midline cerebellar hypoplasia seen in this disorder is due to a decrease in Wnt signaling, which can be rescued with lithium treatment. Based on our results with <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants, we propose a model of the events that occur during midline fusion, disrupted in Joubert syndrome (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). Midline fusion from E12.5 to E16.5 occurs with tissue growth at the midline that progressively fills in both posteriorly and ventrally. Rescue experiments with lithium treatments suggest that vermis formation may reflect a combination of at least two processes. First, the surrounding tissue expands due to Wnt dependent proliferation. Second, cells at the midline fuse through an as yet undefined process, which likely involves cell migration and intercalation. Wnt pathway mutations have been identified in cerebellar cancer, termed medulloblastoma<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, but an endogenous role for Wnt signaling in cerebellar precursor proliferation had not previously been identified. The early Wnt-dependent proliferation at the midline described here, is at least one key step that is abnormal in Joubert syndrome mutants. This proliferation defect can be mathematically modeled using our observations from BrdU pulse labeling experiments, which reveals a fit with a 2-stage model of proliferation during cerebellar development: an early Wnt-dependent stage and a later Shh-dependent stage (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Discussion</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P24">The <italic>Ahi1</italic> and <italic>Cep290</italic> phenotypes are relatively mild in comparison to genes required for ciliogenesis<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. This, along with the cilia staining in <italic>Ahi1</italic> mutants, suggests that rather than an overall ciliogenesis defect, Joubert syndrome may reflect a more specific defect in cilia function or signaling. Both Jbn and Cep290 have been implicated in transport at the cilium<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and Jbn has already been shown to function in nuclear Î²-catenin transport<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Perhaps deficient transport of signaling components such as Î²-catenin is responsible for more specific downstream signaling defects. Additionally, although Shh signaling appeared largely intact, we cannot rule out possible roles in other signaling pathways important for cerebellum development, such as BMP<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, Notch<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and FGF<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> signaling pathways, and it will be interesting to examine possible roles for the cilium in these pathways. Overall, these results provide the first insight into a precise mechanism of Joubert syndrome pathogenesis and a unique process of midline fusion involving proliferation followed by tissue fusion. We propose that it is the proliferative phase that is defective in Joubert syndrome and leads to hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. Future studies, as well as more complete evaluations, will be needed to test whether Wnt pathway modulators, such as lithium, may represent a promising candidate treatment in Joubert syndrome.</p>
