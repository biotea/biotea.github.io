      <abstract>
        <p>Differential modifications of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) determine DNA repair pathways at stalled replication forks. In yeast, PCNA monoubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) yRad18 promotes translesion synthesis (TLS), whereas the lysine-63âlinked polyubiquitination of PCNA by yRad5 (E3) promotes the error-free mode of bypass. The yRad5-dependent pathway is important to prevent genomic instability during replication, although its exact molecular mechanism is poorly understood. This mechanism has remained totally elusive in mammals because of the lack of apparent <italic>RAD5</italic> homologues. We report that a putative tumor suppressor gene, <italic>SHPRH</italic>, is a human orthologue of yeast <italic>RAD5</italic>. SHPRH associates with PCNA, RAD18, and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 (E2) and promotes methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)âinduced PCNA polyubiquitination. The reduction of SHPRH by stable short hairpin RNA increases sensitivity to MMS and enhances genomic instability. Therefore, the yRad5/SHPRH-dependent pathway is a conserved and fundamental DNA repair mechanism that protects the genome from genotoxic stress.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA damage blocks the progression of replicative DNA polymerases and causes stalled replication forks at S phase. Persistent stalled replication forks collapse and cause genomic instability or cell death (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Kolodner et al., 2002</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, stalled replication forks are resolved either by bypassing DNA damage with translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases or by template switching to the nascent strand of sister chromatid (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Smirnova and Klein, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich, 2005</xref>). The selection of these pathways is regulated through the modification of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a homotrimeric complex that encircles DNA strands and functions as a loading dock for DNA polymerases as well as various DNA repair machinery.</p>
      <p>PCNA is monoubiquitinated at the lysine 164 (K164) by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) yRad18 with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) yRad6/Ubc2 after the cells are treated with a low concentration (0.02%) of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>). Monoubiquitinated PCNA switches the replicative DNA polymerase Î´ to nonessential polymerases specialized for TLS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Friedberg et al., 2005</xref>). After the treatment of yeast cells with MMS, the same monoubiquitinated lysine residue of PCNA is further modified with a noncanonical lysine 63 (K63)âlinked polyubiquitin chain by yRad5 (E3) along with the yUbc13âyMms2 (E2 and E2 variant) heterodimer complex (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>). This modification of PCNA presumably promotes the error-free mode of bypass, which is thought to use a template-switch type of recombination through reversal of stalled forks (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich, 2005</xref>). However, nothing is known about molecular mechanisms downstream from PCNA polyubiquitination.</p>

      <p>Mammalian PCNA also undergoes monoubiquitination after a low dose of MMS (0.02%) and UV irradiation, and monoubiquitinated PCNA preferentially binds to TLS polymerases (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Kannouche et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Friedberg et al., 2005</xref>). So far, no evident PCNA polyubiquitination has been observed in mammals. Furthermore, even though homologues of yRad18 (RAD18), yRad6 (HHR6A and HHR6B), yUbc13 (UBC13), yMms2 (MMS2/ UEV2), and downstream TLS polymerases have been identified (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Koken et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann and Pickart, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Masutani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Tateishi et al., 2000</xref>), no apparent <italic>RAD5</italic> homologues have been discovered. Therefore, it has been controversial whether the mammalian error-free mode of bypass exists, and PCNA regulation through differential ubiquitinations is a conserved and fundamental mechanism in mammals.</p>
      <p>
<italic>SHPRH</italic> is a putative tumor suppressor gene encoding a large protein of 1,683 amino acids with various predicted functional domains, including SWI2/SNF2 and RING domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sood et al., 2003</xref>). The human <italic>SHPRH</italic> gene was mapped to chromosome 6q24, which has been suggested to contain tumor suppressor genes. Four point mutations in the <italic>SHPRH</italic> gene were identified in melanoma and ovarian cancerâderived cell lines, although roles of SHPRH in cancer development have been largely unexplored (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sood et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In an effort to investigate whether mammals have a yeast Rad5âlike pathway that prevents genomic instability, we identified <italic>SHPRH</italic> as a human <italic>RAD5</italic> orthologue. We demonstrate that SHPRH has conserved biochemical properties with yeast Rad5 and suppresses genomic instability by promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA.</p>

        <title>Human SHPRH promotes noncanonical K63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA</title>
        <p>Yeast Rad5 is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of helicases with the E3 activity (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1992</xref>). A unique structural feature of yRad5 is that the RING domain for its E3 activity is embedded between the conserved motifs IV and V of the SWI2/SNF2 domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To identify human proteins with this unique domain structure, we performed a SMART search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</ext-link>) and identified a putative tumor suppressor gene, <italic>SHPRH</italic>. SHPRH and yRad5 show 45.5 and 36.4% identities and 62.1 and 47.3% similarities in the SWI2/SNF2 and RING domains, respectively, but have little homology in other sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606145/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606145/DC1</ext-link>). SHPRH also contains predicted linker-histone and PHD-finger domains, which are not found in yRad5. Just like mammalian <italic>RAD18</italic>, which shares even higher sequence similarity with <italic>yRAD18</italic> (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Tateishi et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>SHPRH</italic> expression could not rescue the UV sensitivity of the <italic>rad5</italic> strain (Fig. S2).</p>
        <p>To test whether SHPRH is a functional orthologue of yRad5, we examined whether SHPRH could polyubiquitinate PCNA. The overexpression of HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub), FLAG-tagged PCNA (FLAG-PCNA), and myc-Hisâtagged SHPRH (SHPRH-myc-His) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells induced mono- and polyubiquitinations of PCNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 5). PCNA polyubiquitination by SHPRH was further enhanced by UBC13âMMS2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 7) but not by RAD6 (lane 6) or UBC13 with the C87A mutation, which inactivates the E2 activity of UBC13 (lane 8). In contrast, RAD18 exclusively induced PCNA monoubiquitination with RAD6 (Fig. S3 A, lanes 6 and 7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606145/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606145/DC1</ext-link>). Enhancement of PCNA monoubiquitination by SHPRH may be caused by competition between SHPRH and the deubiquitin enzyme USP1, which removes monoubiquitin from PCNA (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). To clarify the role of the RING domain in SHPRH, we created two proteins: one with a mutation at the conserved cysteine 1432 in the RING domain (C1432A) and the other with a deletion of the entire RING domain at the C terminus (ÎRING). Both mutants showed reduced levels of PCNA polyubiquitinations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lane 4; and Fig. S3 B), suggesting a role of the RING domain of SHPRH. The remaining levels of PCNA ubiquitinations observed in these mutants imply that SHPRH mutants may be able to ârecruitâ or ânucleateâ endogenous SHPRH or other E3 ligases. Supporting the specificity of overexpressed SHPRH to PCNA, SHPRH expression did not affect the basal polyubiquitination level of His<sub>6</sub>-c-JUN, a nuclear protein modified with a lysine 48âlinked polyubiquitin chain by several ubiquitin ligases, such as SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Nateri et al., 2004</xref>; Fig. S3 C).</p>

        <title>Conserved roles of SHPRH as a human Rad5 orthologue</title>
        <p>To determine whether SHPRH polyubiquitinates the conserved K164 of PCNA, which is also targeted by yRad5, PCNA (either wild type or K164R mutant) was immunoprecipitated and the level of mono- and polyubiquitinations was analyzed. PCNA with the K164R mutation was defective in mono- and polyubiquitinations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, the SHPRH-promoted polyubiquitination of PCNA was reduced by the overexpression of the ubiquitin(K63R) mutant but was enhanced by the ubiquitin(K48R) mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). We therefore concluded that SHPRH functions with the UBC13âMMS2 complex to modify the K164 of PCNA with a noncanonical K63-linked polyubiquitin chain in vivo.</p>
        <p>Previous yeast studies suggested that the monoubiquitination of PCNA by yRad18 precedes polyubiquitination by yRad5 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>). It is consistent with genetic observations that y<italic>RAD18</italic> is epistatic to y<italic>RAD5</italic> after exposure to various DNA-damaging agents (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich and Jentsch, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Motegi et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, stable knockdown of RAD18 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) substantially reduced SHPRH-mediated PCNA polyubiquitination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, coexpression of RAD18 and RAD6 with SHPRH and UBC13âMMS2 synergistically promoted the polyubiquitination of endogenous PCNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results clearly indicate that the PCNA monoubiquitination by RAD18âRAD6 and polyubiquitination by SHPRHâUBC13âMMS2 are sequential, rather than competitive, events.</p>

        <title>SHPRH interacts with PCNA, UBC13, and RAD18 and self-multimerizes</title>
        <p>Yeast Rad5 interacts with PCNA, yUbc13, and yRad18 and self-multimerizes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich and Jentsch, 2000</xref>). We observed that SHPRH physically interacted with GST-fused PCNA (wild type or K164R mutant) and GST-UBC13, but not with GST-MMS2, GST-RAD6, or GST alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). The interactions between the PCNA(K164R) mutant and SHPRH or RAD18 suggest that the ubiquitination of PCNA is not essential for these interactions. SHPRH interacted with UBC13 and weakly with UBC13(C87A) in vivo (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Although structural studies predicted that the interaction site on UBC13 with RING domains is distinct from the cysteine C87 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">VanDemark et al., 2001</xref>), C87 may affect this interaction in vivo. In addition, we observed an increased level of SHPRH protein in cells coexpressing wild-type UBC13 and, to a lesser extent, UBC13(C87A), suggesting the stabilization of SHRPH through the complex formation with UBC13. We also identified the self-association of SHPRH and the interaction between SHPRH and RAD18 by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

SHPRH-FLAG was pulled down with GST-fused PCNA (wild type or K164R mutant; A) or with GST-fused E2s (B) and analyzed by blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. RAD18-FLAG was also pulled down with GST-PCNA (A). (C and D) SHPRH associates with UBC13 in vivo. SHPRH-myc-His (C) or SHPRH-FLAG (D) was coexpressed with wild-type UBC13-HA, UBC13(CA)-HA, or MMS2-HA in the combinations indicated. Anti-myc (C) or anti-HA (D) immunoprecipitates were blotted with an anti-HA (C) or anti-FLAG (D) antibody. Note that the level of SHPRH is enhanced in the presence of wild-type UBC13 and, to a lesser extent, UBC13(CA). SHPRH showed a weak but reproducible interaction with UBC13(CA). Blots with antiâÎ±-tubulin or anti-GFP serve as loading or transfection control, respectively. (E and F) SHPRH interacts with RAD18 and self-multimerizes in vivo. In F, cell lysates expressing SHPRH-FLAG and SHPRH-myc-His were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody and blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody. Normal IgG antibody was used for control.</p>

        <title>SHPRH suppresses genomic instability through PCNA polyubiquitination</title>
        <p>To investigate the biological significance of PCNA polyubiquitination in mammalian cells, we transfected HEK 293T cells with low amounts of plasmids that express HA-ubiquitin and FLAG-PCNA, with or without SHPRH-myc-His, and treated with various DNA-damaging agents. No apparent changes in PCNA polyubiquitination were detected after treating cells with 30 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV or 0.3 mM of the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In contrast, PCNA polyubiquitination was induced after treating cells with 0.01% MMS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 7). MMS-induced PCNA polyubiquitination was strongly enhanced by the additional expression of SHPRH. We also noticed that the signals of SHPRH in the cell extracts were reduced only when cells were treated with MMS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 8), implying that SHPRH was redistributed to the insoluble (chromatin bound) fraction. MMS treatment of HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (without any transfections) also showed endogenous PCNA polyubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). To examine the cell cycle specificity of PCNA polyubiquitination, we treated cells arrested in G1 phase or 4 h after release from the G1 arrest with MMS. We observed a somewhat substantial level of PCNA polyubiquitination in untreated cells in G1 phase, but not in S phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). Importantly, PCNA polyubiquitination was most efficiently induced in midâS phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, lane 4).</p>

        <p>Accumulating evidence suggests that DNA damage bypass followed by PCNA modifications is important for suppressing genomic instability and cancers. For example, the overexpression of HHR6B was implicated in the chromosomal instability phenotypes of human breast cancer cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Shekhar et al., 2002</xref>). The targeted disruptions of the <italic>RAD18</italic> or <italic>REV3L</italic> gene in either mouse embryonic stem cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively, increased genomic instability, including sister chromatid exchange, homologous recombination, and illegitimate recombination (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Tateishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wittschieben et al., 2006</xref>).
