      <abstract>
        <p>Snail1 is a major factor for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important event in tumor metastasis and in other pathologies. Snail1 is tightly regulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Control of Snail1 protein stability and nuclear export by GSK3Î² phosphorylation is important for Snail1 functionality. Stabilization mechanisms independent of GSK3Î² have also been reported, including interaction with LOXL2 or regulation of the COP9 signalosome by inflammatory signals. To get further insights into the role of Snail1 phosphorylation, we have performed an in-depth analysis of in vivo human Snail1 phosphorylation combined with mutational studies. We identify new phosphorylation sites at serines 11, 82, and 92 and confirmed previously suggested phosphorylations at serine 104 and 107. Serines 11 and 92 participate in the control of Snail1 stability and positively regulate Snail1 repressive function and its interaction with mSin3A corepressor. Furthermore, serines 11 and 92 are required for Snail1-mediated EMT and cell viability, respectively. PKA and CK2 have been characterized as the main kinases responsible for in vitro Snail1 phosphorylation at serine 11 and 92, respectively. These results highlight serines 11 and 92 as new players in Snail1 regulation and suggest the participation of CK2 and PKA in the modulation of Snail1 functionality.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby cells lose cellâcell interactions and other epithelial properties while acquiring a more migratory and mesenchymal phenotype. EMT occurs at several stages of early development and an EMT-like process is thought to occur during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Thiery, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Gupta and MassaguÃ©, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Moreno-Bueno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Yang and Weinberg, 2008</xref>). A hallmark of EMTs is the functional loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) which mediates cell-cell interactions. Snail1 is one of a family of transcription factors shown to repress transcription of the <italic>CDH1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Batlle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) and has been shown to be crucial to development in mice, because <italic>Snail1</italic> knockout mutants die at gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Snail1 also regulates the expression of different target genes involved in EMT and other functions, such as cell survival (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005</xref>). Importantly, Snail1 has been shown to be up-regulated in various tumor types (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and has more recently been observed expressed at the tumor stromal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">FrancÃ­ <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2009</xref>).</p><p>To date, several studies have examined the posttranslational modifications that control Snail1 cell function. Snail1 consists of four C-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers and a regulatory region spanning amino acids 1â150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Sefton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), comprising an N-terminal SNAG (SNAIL and Gfi conserved) domain (1â9 amino acids) important for corepressor interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hemavathy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and the serine-rich domain (SRD), which appears to control the function of a short leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) recognized by the CRM1 transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">DomÃ­nguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Initial studies demonstrated that the SRD was important for subcellular localization and that mutation of all serines-to-alanine residues in that region resulted in cytoplasmic localization of Snail1 and consequent repressive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">DomÃ­nguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Additionally, two separate investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) identified a short sequence in the SRD important for Snail1 posttranslational regulation. This short sequence is conserved in several proteins, including Î²-catenin and IKÎºB, and is termed destruction box (DB). The DB in the case of Î²-catenin contains two serines, the phosphorylation of which is critical for recognition and ubiquitination by the Î²-TrCP ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Nelson and Nusse, 2004</xref>). This leads to proteasomal degradation and thereby constitutes an important shared control mechanism for the government of several transcriptional regulators simultaneously. In Snail1 these serines lie at positions 96 and 100 (D<sup>96</sup>SGKG<sup>100</sup>SQPP), are evolutionary conserved, and are the target for the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3Î²). Mutation of these serines to alanine leads to increased Snail1 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Yook <italic>et al.</italic> also identified two additional conserved serines (QPP<sup>104</sup>SPP<sup>107</sup>SPAP) as targets for the serine/threonine protein kinase GSK3Î². Based on those results two models were proposed to explain the regulation of Snail1 by GSK3Î². <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> proposed that phosphorylation of serines 104 and 107 would prime GSK3Î² phosphorylation of serines 96 and 100 in the DB, thus leading to ubiquitination and degradation of Snail1. In support of this model they found that GSK3Î² was one of the components of a regulatory complex, including Axin2 that facilitates the shuttling of GSK3Î² between nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Yook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> proposed a slightly different model whereby nuclear GSK3Î² phosphorylation of serines 107, 111, 115, and 119 prompts Snail1 nuclear export. Cytoplasmic Snail1 is then phosphorylated at serines 96 and 100 by GSK3Î² promoting ubiquitination and degradation. An additional proposed modulator of Snail1 was p21-activated kinase (PAK1), which may phosphorylate Snail1 at serine 246 (TF<sup>246</sup>SRM) to favor its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). This serine is conserved in all the members of the Snail family and is located within the C-terminal zinc finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Manzanares <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nieto, 2002</xref>). Posttranslational regulation of Snail1 stability by GSK3Î²-independent mechanisms has also been reported, including stabilization by lysyl oxidase like-2 (LOXL2) interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), mediated by TNF-Î±/NF-ÎºB and COP9 signalosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>), and cap-independent translational regulation by YB-1 factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, interaction between Snail and the F-box protein PpA has also been implicated in Snail2 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Vernon and Labonne, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The phosphorylation of Snail1 in previous studies has been analyzed by mutation of the serine residues or by alterations of the mobility shift in Western blots, but not by in vivo analysis of Snail1 phosphorylation sites. In the present study, we have performed a complete analysis of Snail1 phosphorylation in vivo to clarify and complement previous investigations. We have identified several new sites of phosphorylation (S11, S82, and S92) with regulatory implications in Snail1 functionality as well as confirming some of those previously described (S104 and S107). We also propose that, in addition to GSK3Î², the ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase-2) and the cAMP-activated kinase PKA (protein kinase A) may play a role in Snail1 function and regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generation of Plasmids and Expression Vectors</title><p>The pcDNA3-HA plasmid containing human <italic>SNAIL1</italic> cDNA described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) has been used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis.

Briefly, phosphorylated Snail1 bands were excised from the membrane and blocked for 30 min in 0.5% polyvinylpirrolidon K30 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.6% acetic acid at 37Â°C. After several washes with distilled water, bands were each incubated overnight in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.0, with 1 Î¼g modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37Â°C. The solution containing eluted peptides was transferred to a fresh tube and the radioactivity measured to ensure efficient elution. The peptides were then frozen and dried by vacuum evaporation. They were then oxidized in performic acid for 1 h on ice in the dark. The oxidization was stopped through dilution in water, the solution was frozen, and vacuum evaporated. A further overnight digestion with trypsin was required to ensure efficient trypsin digestion. The peptides were then washed twice in water, with vacuum-evaporating in between, and then were resuspended in 200 Î¼l electrophoresis running buffer (2.5% formic acid, 7.5% acetic acid, pH 1.9), centrifuged 15 min at 15,000 Ã <italic>g</italic>, to remove remaining insoluble material.

Interestingly, phosphopeptide 3 is not detected in mutant S92A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), suggesting that the phosphorylation at serine 92 is required for phosphorylation at serine 82. Phosphopeptide 4 was weakly detected in most Snail1-HA mutants, making its identification difficult. However, its Edmannâ²s degradation pattern was similar to that of peptide 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), and its complete disappearance in S11A and S92A mutants suggests it may correspond to a miscut or other posttranslational modifications.</p><p>Phosphopeptides 5 and 6 both represent phosphorylations at serines 104 and 107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Indeed, there appear to be several peptide species with high hydrophobicity and low electrophoretic mobility. This group of phosphopeptides was poorly resolved in most of the analyzed mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, BâF), and these are thought to represent various modes of posttranslational modification of peptide 99-137, in particular affecting serine 104 and serine 107, because they disappear in the S104A/S107A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Peptide 99-137 exhibits no charge and a high hydrophobicity (aprox. 0.61), and phosphorylation of one to three serines in the peptide would have a very weak impact on migration in chromatography, due to the considerable length of the peptide.</p><p>Of note was the absence of peptides phosphorylated at serines 96 or 100, the two serines within the DB motif, proposed previously to be phosphorylated by GSK3Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). One possible explanation may be that subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of phospho-serine 96/100 protein occurs so quickly as to prevent attainment of these phosphopeptides. Although not observed, it is important not to discount other possible phosphorylations within the SRD as the large size of this peptide and progressive weakness of signal obtained from Edmann's sequencing may have obscured further downstream phosphorylations occurring at serines 111, 115, and 119.</p><p>Interestingly, the triple mutation of serines 92, 104, and 107 almost completely ablated phosphopeptides expected to represent phosphorylation in the SRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). Therefore, it appears that either further phosphorylation in this region does not occur or that such phosphorylations are principally dependent on phosphorylations of serines 92, 104, and 107.</p><p>It was previously reported that Snail1 is phosphorylated at serine 246 by PAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, we were unable to detect any potential phosphopeptide corresponding to TF<sup>246</sup>SR, even under shorter electrophoretic run (to prevent the loss of high mobility peptides; Supplemental Figure S1). Furthermore, analysis of in vivo phosphorylation of S246A mutation did not reveal any change in its phosphorylation pattern compared with wild-type Snail1 (Supplemental Figure S2), suggesting that no phosphorylation occurs at serine 246 in our experimental system. It is possible, however, that there was insufficient PAK1 activity in HEK293T cells, yet because this phosphorylation was deemed critical for Snail1 function, we would expect to observe it in wild-type Snail1. The only phosphopeptide corresponding to serine 246 phosphorylation would coincide with phosphopeptide 1 after trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). As mentioned above, phosphopeptide 1 disappears in S11A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), but was unaffected in S246A mutant (Supplemental Figure S2).</p><p>Also of note is that, with the exception of Snail1S92A mutation effecting phosphorylation at serine 82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), the ablation of the various serines did not have significant effect on other phosphorylations, suggesting they occur independently of each other, although effects on global phosphorylation level cannot be discounted.</p><p>Overall, the present results indicate that Snail1 is phosphorylated in vivo at positions 11, 82, 92, 104, and 107 and that although other sites may be present, they are less frequently phosphorylated.</p></sec><sec><title>Snail1 Is Phosphorylated by CK2 at Serine 92 and by PKA at Serine 11 In Vitro</title><p>To identify possible serine/threonine kinase candidates for the phosphorylated serines in Snail1 we carried out in silico analysis of Snail1 protein using NetphosK 1.0 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhosK">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhosK</ext-link>).</p><p>A probability score of 0.7 was given for PKA at serine 11 and 0.54 for CK2 at serine 92.

We found that the Snail1S92A mutation led to greatly increased stability compared with wild-type Snail1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, A and B), suggesting that phosphorylation at serine 92 forms part of the Snail1 degradation mechanism.

In agreement with this, the double Snail1S104A/S107A mutant shows increased protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, C and D) and exhibits a repressive activity on the human <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter similar to that of Snail1 wild type in HEK293T cells (Supplemental Figure S4).

Significantly, the phosphorylation mimicking Snail1S92E mutant rescues the repressor activity on <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter to levels similar to the Snail1 wild type (Supplemental Figure S5), indicating that electrostatic modification of serine 92 produced by phosphorylation is required for efficient Snail1-mediated repression. Interestingly, the Snail1S11A mutant also showed a marked increased stability compared with wild-type Snail1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, C and D), despite its strongly decreased repressor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Serine to alanine mutation in serine 11, 92, and 104/107 increases Snail1 stability.

To this end, MDCK cells were stably transfected with human Snail1-HA wild-type, Snail1S11A-HA, or Snail1S92A-HA versions. MDCK cells expressing Snail1-HA suffered EMT (80% of the clones) with complete loss of E-cadherin and increased expression and organization of vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, A, b, f, and j, and B) in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In contrast, MDCK cells expressing the Snail1S11A-HA mutant exhibited an unaltered epithelial phenotype (75% of the clones) similar to that of the mock-control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, cf. c and d with a) and maintain the expression of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) organized in cellâcell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, cf. g and h, with e) and basal vimentin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, cf. k and l with i). Importantly, the majority of MCDK-Snail1S11A-HA clones express the mutant Snail1S11A protein to levels similar to those of Snail1-HA wild type present in MDCK-Snail1 suffering EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Strikingly, repeated attempts to stably express the Snail1S92A-HA mutant were unsuccessful or resulted in a very low number of stable colonies, suggesting that mutation of serine 92 has a deleterious effect on survival of MDCK cells. Indeed, analysis of the isolated clones indicated that although most of them maintain the epithelial phenotype with absence of EMT features (Supplemental Figure S6, A and B), they express almost undetectable levels of Snail1-S92A-HA protein even lower of basal endogenous Snail1 (Supplemental Figure S6C). The basal nonfunctional level of endogenous Snail1 detected in control MDCK-CMV cells is in agreement with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These results reinforce the functional requirement of intact S11 and S92 residues for Snail1 function in EMT and cell survival, respectively.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Serine 11 is required for Snail1 induction of EMT.

To date, several studies had examined the control of Snail1 through phosphorylation, supporting the action of negative (GSK3Î²) and positive (PAK1) kinase players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recently, identification of the small C-terminal domain phosphatase (SCP) as responsible for dephosphorylation of Snail1-GSK3Î² phosphorylated has added a new level of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>). An alternative mechanism for Snail1 stabilization by TNF-Î±/NF-ÎºB pathway independent of GSK3Î² phosphorylation has been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>), indicating the existence of several pathways to control Snail1 stability in response to different cues. However, in none of these studies was there a detailed analysis of in vivo Snail1 phosphorylation and its influence in Snail1 repressor and functional activity. Here, we presented a detailed analysis of human Snail1 in vivo phosphorylation. Phosphopeptide and mutational analysis demonstrate that Snail1 serines 11, 82, 92, 104, and 107 were phosphorylated in vivo. Importantly, phosphorylations of S11 and S92 are independently required for Snail1 repressor activity of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter and for efficient recruitment of the mSin3A corepressor. Furthermore, intact serine 11 and serine 92 are required for in vivo Snail1 function in induction of EMT and/or cell survival, respectively.</p><p>It had been initially shown, through in vivo phosphoamino acid analysis that the majority of Snail1 phosphorylations occurred on serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">DomÃ­nguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, those previous studies demonstrated a marked reduction in phosphorylation of Snail1 mutants generated either by mutating all serines to alanine between residues 82-123 or by deleting this region entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">DomÃ­nguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Our present results indicate that this is due to the lack of phosphorylation at serines 82, 92, 104, and 107, and the remaining phosphorylation observed in those mutants would be attributed to serine 11. Two other investigations have previously examined Snail1 SRD phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), demonstrating a role for GSK3Î² in SRD phosphorylation and regulation of Snail1 stability, through slightly different models.</p><p>Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> found serines 104 and 107 to be the only double mutant with significant effect on Snail1 stability, emphasizing the importance of these two residues. In agreement with those previous observations, we found both serines 104 and 107 to be phosphorylated together in vivo. Zhou and colleagues proposed a slightly different model where GSK3Î² initially phosphorylates Snail1 in the nucleus at serines 119, 115, 111, and 107, promoting its nuclear export to the cytoplasm where GSK3Î² further phosphorylates the DB serines (S96 and S100), eliciting ubiquitination and degradation. However, we observed serines 104 and 107 phosphorylated together without detectable phosphorylation of serines 111, 115, and 119. Furthermore, mutations of Snail1 at serines 111, 115, and 119 did not result in obvious changes in the in vivo phosphorylation pattern or abrogation of the phosphopeptides corresponding to S104 and S107, suggesting that these are not âprimingâ phosphorylations (data not shown). Overall, our in vivo data tend to support the model originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Yook <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>, favoring that GSK3Î² probably phosphorylates serines 104 and 107 and then 96 and 100 to promote degradation. However, we should not completely discount the possibility of phosphorylations at serines 111, 115, and 119 because the resolution of the larger peptide species containing the SRD was poor and sequencing may have missed phosphorylations so distant from the N-termini of the peptide. Surprisingly, we could not detect in vivo phosphorylation at serines 96 and 100, although we suspect that the ubiquitination and degradation of this Snail1 species prevented observance of these phosphorylations.</p><p>The serine at position 82 appears more cryptic and is only weakly phosphorylated relative to other serines in Snail1. In silico analysis did not reveal any likely kinase candidates although GSK3Î² and p38MAPK had the highest probability scores of 0.48. Despite this, phosphorylation at serine 82 appears to be influenced by that on serine 92, because it completely disappears in mutant Snail1S92A, perhaps by promoting a conformational change. The functional significance of serine 82 phosphorylation remains to be investigated.</p><p>Also of interest, was the lack of detection in our analysis of in vivo phosphorylation at serine 246 previously speculated to be critical for Snail1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In our hands, mutation at this site resulted in no effect on Snail1's phosphorylation pattern, cellular localization, or function (Supplemental Figures S1 and S2; data not shown). It may be that the effects observed previously in this mutant are due to secondary effects present in particular cellular contexts, due to changes in zinc finger binding or on nuclear import sequences lying nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Mingot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our present study provides evidence for new regulatory phosphorylation events in Snail1 at serine 92 and at serine 11 with consequences in Snail1 stability and, more importantly, in Snail1-mediated repression and functional activity. Interestingly, phosphorylation of serine 92 does not appear to prime or stimulate phosphorylation in the SRD region, because no change in the phosphorylation pattern in this region was observed in the Snail1S92A mutant. However, we observed that, despite its increased stability, the Snail1S92A mutant has strongly decreased repressor activity on the <italic>E-cadherin</italic> promoter relative to Snail1 wild type. Importantly, this was associated to a marked decreased interaction with mSin3A corepressor. These observations indicate that phosphorylation at serine 92 positively regulates Snail1 transcriptional repression by a mechanism dependent on efficient recruitment of mSin3A corepressor.</p><p>We also observed phosphorylation at serine 11, adjacent to the SNAG domain known to be critical for Snail1 repressive action and interaction with corepressors (Hemavathy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Peinado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Ablation of S11 phosphorylation, despite inducing increased stability, strongly attenuated Snail1 repression on <italic>E-cadherin</italic> and <italic>claudin-1</italic> promoters, suggesting that serine 11 phosphorylation is necessary for correct interaction with corepressors. Indeed almost complete abrogation of interaction with mSin3A was detected in the Snail1S11A mutant. Mutation of this site did not result in any change in subcellular localization despite its proximity to lysines (K9, K16) identified as part of a nuclear import signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), although recent studies also indicate the participation of residues in the zinc finger region for efficient Snail1 nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Mingot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the in vitro phosphorylation studies identified serine 92 and serine 11 as the main phosphorylated substrates of CK2 and PKA, respectively, suggesting that both kinases may be involved in Snail1 regulation in vivo by directly modulating Snail1-mSin3A interaction.</p><p>The direct implication of serine 11 in Snail1 activity has been demonstrated in functional transfection studies, because mutation of serine 11 abrogates the EMT inducing activity of Snail1, indicating that intact serine 11 is required for Snail1 to drive the EMT program, affecting not only <italic>E-cadherin</italic> repression but the regulation of other Snail1 target genes, like <italic>claudin-1</italic>. Mutation of serine 92 in Snail1 also results in abrogation of the EMT program and, strikingly, in cell lethality, reinforcing the functional requirement of serine 92 for EMT and additional Snail1 functions as cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Vega <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), although further studies are required to characterize the involvement of serine 92 in Snail1-mediated regulation of cell survival.</p><p>The results presented here strongly support that phosphorylation of Snail1 at serine 11 and serine 92, likely mediated by PKA and CK2, respectively, emerge as new positive regulatory pathways of Snail1 repressor activity both influencing mSin3A corepressor recruitment and functional activity. In this context, it is interesting to note that Î²-catenin is also regulated by CK2 and PKA phosphorylation, both directly and through its interaction with APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hildesheim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Taurin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Regulation of the tumor suppressor PML by CK2 has also been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Scaglioni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Stehmeier and Muller, 2009</xref>). The positive regulation of Snail1 function by CK2 proposed here, provides new mechanistic aspects to support the participation of this kinase in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Taken together, the present results reinforce the existence of a complex regulatory network in Snail1 posttranslational regulation involving activating and inhibitory phosphorylation mechanisms and putting into the stage new players as serines 11 and 92 and, potentially, CK2 and PKA kinases. These observations, together with recently reported alternative mechanisms for Snail1 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>), provide potential novel targets to influence Snail1 function in tumor progression.</p></sec>
