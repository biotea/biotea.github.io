      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) is a key regulator of centriole duplication, an event critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we showed that Plk4 relocalizes from the inner Cep192 ring to the outer Cep152 ring as newly recruited Cep152 assembles around the Cep192-encircled daughter centriole. Crystal structure analyses revealed that Cep192 - and Cep152-derived peptides bind the cryptic polo box (CPB) of Plk4 in opposite orientations and in a mutually exclusive manner. The Cep152-peptide bound to the CPB markedly better than the Cep192-peptide and effectively snatched the CPB away from a preformed CPBâCep192-peptide complex. A cancer-associated Cep152 mutation impairing the Plk4 interaction induced defects in procentriole assembly and chromosome segregation. Thus, Plk4 is intricately regulated in time and space through ordered interactions with two distinct scaffolds, Cep192 and Cep152, and a failure in this process may lead to human cancer.</p>

    <p id="P2">As the principal microtubule-organizing center in mammalian cells, the centrosome plays a central role inspindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Centrosomes contain two orthogonally arranged centrioles, which duplicate precisely once per cell cycle <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. A failure in this process can result in abnormal centrosome numbers, improper spindle formation and chromosome missegregation that ultimately leads to genomic instability and human disorders <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, accurate control of centriole duplication is fundamentally required for normal cell division and proliferation.</p>
    <p id="P3">Centriole duplication begins by assembling a procentriole in G1/S phase. Proper recruitment of a member of the polo kinase subfamily, Plk4, to centrosomes appears to be a key event that triggers the entire duplication process <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Interestingly, while nematodes and flies utilize distinct centrosomal scaffolds, Spd-2 and Asterless (Asl), respectively, to recruit their Plk4 orthologs <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, humans require both Cep192 (Spd-2 ortholog) and Cep152 (Asl ortholog) for this event <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Whether Cep192 and Cep152 function cooperatively <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> or hierarchically <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> to recruit Plk4 to centrosomes remains controversial.</p>
    <p id="P4">In this study, we set out to investigate how the two dissimilar scaffold proteins, Cep192 and Cep152, regulate Plk4 localization at subcentrosomal structures. We showed that they interact with Plk4 in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, thus ensuring timely formation of distinct Plk4 complexes at different subcentrosomal structures. Our data suggest that ordered binding of these two scaffolds to Plk4 is critical to promote Plk4-mediated centriole biogenesis and to maintain genomic integrity.</p>

        <title>Plk4 ring enlarges as Cep152 localizes to centrioles</title>
        <p id="P5">To understand the functional relationships between Plk4 and the two Plk4-binding scaffold proteins, Cep192 and Cep152, at the initial stage of centriole biogenesis, we first examined the subcentriolar localization patterns of these proteins in U2OS cells by performing three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">Early in G1, Plk4 assumed a ring-like structure surrounding the proximal part of cylindrical centrioles. Interestingly, 3D-SIM images showed that the centrioles decorated with Cep192 but not Cep152 (i.e., daughter centrioles prior to Cep152 recruitment) exhibited a Plk4 ring with an outer diameter of ~443 Â± 34 nm, while the centrioles surrounded with both Cep192 and Cep152 (i.e., mother and late-stage daughter centrioles) displayed a significantly larger Plk4 ring (590 Â± 48 nm outer diameter) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> panels; Fig. 1band <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The sizes of these rings were in good agreement with the findings of Lawo et al <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Consistent with a report that the N-terminus of Cep152 is outwardly oriented <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, Plk4, which binds to the N-terminal region of Cep152<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, was detected at the outskirts of the Cep152 middle region (M), where the antibody epitope is located (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, as Cep152 is recruited around the Cep192-encircled daughter centrioles, Plk4 reassembles into a bigger ring at the boundary of the newly forming Cep152 toroid. Consistent with this view, the morphology of the Plk4 ring structure closely mirrored that of Cep152 during the early stages of Cep152 toroid formation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> panel; bracket). Furthermore, depletion of Cep152 allowed Plk4 to reassociate with the inner Cep192 ring (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1câe</xref>). In lateG1/S, Plk4 fluorescence became a dot-like signal and colocalized with Sas6 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), a component whose recruitment is critical for procentriole assembly <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>Interaction of human CPB with Cep192 and Cep152</title>
        <p id="P7">Since Plk4 colocalized with Cep192 and Cep152 at subcentriolar structures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we examined whether it interacts with these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>. We observed that immunoprecipitation of Cep192 or Cep152 coprecipitated Plk4 at the endogenous level (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, Cep192 and Cep152 did not interact with each other under the same conditions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). These findings suggest that Plk4 forms two distinct complexes with Cep192 or Cep152.</p>
        <p id="P8">Understanding the molecular basis of how Plk4 interacts with Cep192 and Cep152 may shed light on the mechanism of how the Plk4 ring reassembles concurrently with the recruitment of Cep152 to Cep192-associated centrioles. Cryptic polo box (CPB; composed of PB1 and PB2 motifs) <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> is centrally required for targeting Plk4 to centrosomes <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, how CPB interacts with its binding targets is unknown. Notably, unlike Plk1â3, which bind to phosphorylated epitopes <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, Plk4 formed a tight homomeric complex that binds to its targets in a phospho-independent manner (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a âc</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">Next, we sought to structurally characterize how Plk4 CPB interacts with Cep192 and Cep152<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We found that a minimal CPB fragment containing residues 580â808 (referred to hereafter as CPB) was sufficient for homomerization (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>; also, see details below) and that it exhibited the full capacity to interact with the two previously defined motifs, Cep192 (201â280) and Cep152 (1â217) <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). However, in disagreement with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPB model <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, the PB1 of CPB did not interact with another PB1, while the PB2 interacted with another PB2 efficiently (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">Our initial attempt to co-crystallize CPB with Cep192 (201â280) or Cep152 (1â217) failed due to the instability of bacterially expressed proteins. Systematic deletion analysis showed that the Cep152 (1â60) fragment (hereafter, Cep152-60mer) bound to CPB as efficiently as Cep152 (1â217) and coprecipitated the full-length Plk4 at a degree somewhat comparable to that of the full-length Cep152 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2f,g</xref>). The Cep152-60mer exhibited no apparent homology with Cep192 (201â280). However, upon reverse alignment of these two sequences, we were able to identify a Cep192 (201 â258) fragment (hereafter, Cep192-58mer) that contains analogously positioned, predicted Î±-helices and D-rich motifs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), suggesting that they may bind to CPB in opposite orientations. Deletion of the 58-mer region completely abolished the Cep192 -Plk4 interaction, and the Cep192-58mer precipitated the full-length Plk4 efficiently (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2h,i</xref>). These observations suggest that the Cep192-58mer is necessary and sufficient to bind to Plk4.</p>

Like the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPB <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, the structure of human CPB was composed of two PB domains, PB1 (580â700) and PB2 (701â808), each containing an Î±-helix and a six-or seven-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). The PB1 and PB2 domains were connected by a two-residue linker (S700 and P701). Distinct from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPB proposed to form a âdonut-shapedâ homodimer with both PB1-PB1 and PB2-PB2 contacts, all human CPB structures presented here contained an âX-shapedâ homodimer with a symmetrical PB2-PB2 interface, although their crystal lattices differed from one another. This dimeric interaction was verified by a coimmunoprecipitation assay (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, the PB2-PB2 interface was also observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPB structure (PDB: 4G7N), but a different symmetry mate was chosen to form the donut-shaped CPB dimer <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.

        <p id="P13">The X-shaped CPB dimer was generated by a non-crystallographic dyad axis and fastened by four hydrogen bonds between two antiparallel Î²13-strands, one from each subunit, resulting in the formation of a continuous 14-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet. The dimer interface was strengthened by multiple hydrophobic interactions between the two Î²13 strands and also the two Î±2 helices. PB1 domains formed two wings that do not directly interact with each other (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P14">In the complexes, both Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer bound to the concave surface of CPB along the Î±1 of PB1 and over the Î±1âÎ²7 junction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f,g</xref>), inducing slight alterations in the CPB structure (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Remarkably, the 58mer and 60mer peptides were oriented in opposite directions, which reflect the reverse sequence alignment of the two peptides (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition, one Cep192-58mer bound to each subunit of a CPB dimer, generating a symmetrical 2:2 heterotetrameric complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), whereas one Cep152-60mer bound to each CPB dimer, forming a 1:2 heterotrimeric complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>; also, see details below). Unlike Plk1 PBD, which interacts with a phosphorylated peptide through the Î²1 of PB1 and also partly the Î²8 and Î²9 of PB2<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, Plk4 CPB interacted with its target primarily through the Î±1 and Î²1 of PB1 and the Î²7 of PB2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), requiring no phosphorylated epitope.</p>

        <title>Structural of CPBâCep192-58mer versus CPB âCep152-60mer</title>
        <p id="P15">Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer formed three major contacts with CPB. Although the centrally located Î±-helical sequences from the 58mer and the 60mer exhibit no detectable sequence homology (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), they bound to an overlapped region of CPB by engaging in multiple hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with several common residues along the Î±1 and Î²1 of PB1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, left; see details in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). The 58mer Î±-helix was skewed at an oblique angle to the axis of the CPB Î±1, whereas the 60mer Î±-helix was antiparallel to the CPB Î±1, forming tightly packed hydrophobic interactions between the two Î±-helices. The coiled-coil interface was reinforced by salt bridges between the D20 and D23 of the 60mer and the K711 (rectangled) of the CPB (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, left).</p>
        <p id="P16">In addition, the D-rich motif at the N-terminus of Cep192-58mer or the C-terminus of Cep152-60mer interacted with a K/R-enriched crater formed by one arginine and five lysine residues (rectangled) at the tip of the PB1 domain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, right; see details in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Among the crater-forming residues, the side chain of R684 shifted in different directions upon binding either Cep192-58mer or Cep152-60mer (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). The K685 residue, centrally located in the crater, appeared to play a key role in binding the D-rich motif (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, right). Notably, the D-rich motifs exhibited a weak electron density, suggesting that their charge-charge interactions with the K/R crater were diffused cloud-like instead of one-to-one correspondence (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>). A hydrophobic residue present in the middle of the D-stretch of the 58mer and 60mer (I217 and L42, respectively) fit well in the hydrophobic pocket at the center of the K/R crater (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, right, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref> for details). The D-rich motif of the 58mer efficiently neutralized the charge potential of the K/R crater, while that of the 60mer, which contains fewer acidic residues, negated the charge potential less effectively (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P17">Finally, a unique acidic sequence at the N-terminus of theCep152 -60mer (from E15 to E21) appeared to efficiently counteract the positive charge potential near the CPB dimeric interface (i.e., PB2 interface basic patch). This chargeâcharge attraction again occurred through group interactions with poorly defined electron densities for individual side chains. In the CPBâCep192-58mer complex, the neutralizing effect was achieved by the negative helical dipoles of two 58mer peptides coming together near the CPB dimeric interface (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">Consistent with the structural results above, mutational analyses showed that the R684 in the K/R crater was vital for Cep192-58mer binding but not for Cep152-60mer binding, whereas the K711, located near the dimeric interface, was crucial for Cep152-60mer binding, but much less so for Cep192-58mer binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). Interestingly, the K685 of PB1 was required for binding to both Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). This may be due to its dual rolesâone in the intramolecular interaction with the E635 of PB1 and the other in the intermolecular electrostatic interaction with the D-rich motif residues of Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>

Indeed, superposition of CPB-bound Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer (root-mean-square deviation [r.m.s.d.] of 2.2 Ã across all CÎ± atoms of the CPB dimer) showed that Cep152 -60mer not only directly interfered with the binding of Cep192-58mer to the same CPB subunit, but also clashed with the second Cep192-58mer already bound to the other CPB subunit (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting that binding of Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer to CPB is mutually exclusive.</p>
        <p id="P21">To directly investigate the incompatible nature of these bindings to CPB, we performed a fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay using Alexa 488-conjugated MBP-Cep192-58mer and MBP-Cep152-60mer. Results showed that the CPB-binding affinity of Cep152-60mer (K<sub>d</sub>= 32 Â± 4 nM) was ~5.5 -fold higher than that of Cep192-58mer (K<sub>d</sub>= 177 Â± 23 nM) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Consistent with these results, Cep152-60mer efficiently disrupted a preformed complex between Alexa 488-conjugated MBP-Cep192-58mer and CPB (IC<sub>50</sub>= 64 Â± 4 nM). In a reverse experiment, provision of up to an order of magnitude higher concentration of Cep192 -58mer failed to noticeably dissociate Alexa 488-conjugated MBP-Cep152-60mer from CPB (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>; see Methods).</p>

        <title>Characteristics of Plk4 CPB binding</title>
        <p id="P23">Our results demonstrated that CPB utilizesits PB1 Î±1 flanking region, K/R crater, and the dimeric interface basic patch to interact with Cep192-58mer and Cep152-60mer, suggesting that the molecular architecture underlying the formation of these complexes is largely similar. However, the opposite orientations of the bound peptides and the differential usages of these binding sites suggest that CPB may function as a versatile binding module that can interact with diverse cellular targets and mediate distinct cellular processes.

        <p id="P24">It should be noted that, unlike the PBDs from Plk1â3, Plk4 CPB did not require a phosphorylated epitope for binding.

        <title>Molecular basis of unidirectional scaffold switching</title>
        <p id="P25">We showed that Cep152 recruitment induces Plk4 relocation from the outer edge of the Cep192 ring to that of the Cep152 ring (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that Plk4 translocates unidirectionally from the Cep192 scaffold to the Cep152 scaffold. In support of this interpretation, Cep152-60mer was able to efficiently snatch the CPB from the Cep192-58merâCPB complex (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P26">The mechanism underlying this unidirectional cellular process appears to stem from the different binding natures of Cep192-58mer versus Cep152-60mer to Plk4 CPB. Although the physiological binding stoichiometry for endogenous proteins is yet to be determined, Cep192-58mer bound to the CPB with 2:2 stoichiometry, whereas Cep152-60mer bound to the latter with 1:2 stoichiometry (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This is because the C-termini of two Cep192-58mers engaged in heterotetrameric junctional interactions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>), whereas the N-terminal CÎ± backbone (e.g., C Î± of E15âD20) of Cep152-60mer that is bound to one of the two subunits extended beyond the PB2-PB2 dimeric junction and interacted with the basic patch residues in the other subunit (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>). This extended binding would prevent another Cep152-60mer from binding to the second subunit (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P27">So then, how can the binding of one Cep152-60mer dislodge two Cep192-58mers interacting with both subunits of the CPB dimer? First, <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical analysis showed that the 60mer binds to CPB with ~5.5-fold higher affinity than the 58mer. Second, superimposing CPB-bound Cep192-58mer with Cep152-60mer revealed that the extended N-terminus of the 60mer directly interferes with the binding of the C-terminal helix region of the 58mer to the other CPB subunit (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, arrowed bracket). Third, deletion of a portion of the 58mer Î±-helix extending toward the CPB Î²7 and Î²13 eliminated the ability of the 58mer to bind to CPB (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5h</xref>), suggesting that the steric clash between the N-terminal region of the 60mer and the C-terminal Î±-helix of the 58mer is sufficient to dislodge the 58mer from the CPB dimer. Intriguingly, the binding of the 58mer and 60mer to CPB occurs in opposite orientations. This reverse binding mode may help avoid the steric hindrance that could arise if the two bulky Cep192 and Cep152 proteins attempt to bind to Plk4 from the same direction.</p>

        <title>Significance of ordered Plk4 binding to Cep192 or Cep152</title>
        <p id="P28">Our earlier studies have shown that two human centrosomal scaffolds, Cep192 and Cep152, do not appreciably interact with each other, and that the impairment of either one of the Cep192- and Cep152-dependent Plk4 interactions is sufficient to induce a defect in Sas6 recruitment to the procentriole assembly site <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that Cep192 and Cep152 form two biochemically distinct and functionally nonredundant complexes with Plk4and that both complexes are required to promote Plk4 -mediated centriole biogenesis. In support of this view, depletion of Cep63<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> disrupted Cep152 localization to centrioles, but did not appear to alter Cep192 localization to this site (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6aâc</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P29">Here we elucidated the molecular mechanism showing how Cep152 snatches Plk4 away from the Cep192âPlk4 complex and, as a result, repositions Plk4 at the outer edge of a newly forming Cep152 ring (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected if the recruitment of the high affinity Cep152 scaffold caused Plk4 to relocate to the outer rim of the Cep152 ring, depletion of Cep152 permitted Plk4 to reassociate with the inner Cep192 ring structure (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1câe</xref>). Furthermore, when Plk4 was overexpressed, excess Plk4 was additionally localized along the entire length of the Cep192 structure (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6dâg</xref>). These data suggest that Cep192 and Cep152 intricately regulate subcentrosomal localization of Plk4.</p>
        <p id="P30">It should be noted, however, that unlike humans, nematodes utilize Spd-2 (Cep192 ortholog) to recruit Zyg-1 (Plk4 homolog) to centrosomes <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, while flies resort to Asl (Cep152 ortholog) to recruit its Plk4<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. These apparent differences hint that nematodes and flies have lost the ability of one or the other of the two scaffolds to promote Plk4 functions when evolved from their most recent common ancestor, while humans have kept the function of both scaffolds to cope with complex centriolar assembly processes.</p>
        <p id="P31">Then, what advantage is gained in humans by having two scaffolds, Cep192 and Cep152, binding to Plk4 in an ordered manner? One possibility is that, by binding to Plk4, these two scaffolds modulate Plk4 function differently at distinct stages of early G1 phase. We found that Plk4-bound Cep152, but not Cep192, efficiently interacted with Cep135 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), a downstream component critical for procentriole assembly <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Thus, the binding of Cep152 to Plk4 is likely to allow Plk4 to form a biologically active complex with downstream effectors, such as Cep135, and to induce procentriole assembly with other components critical for this process. On the other hand, since overexpression of Plk4 induces centriole over duplication <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, the binding of Cep192 to Plk4 may be important in sequestering Plk4 and preventing it from inducing unscheduled centriole duplication until Cep152 is recruited to early G1 centrioles. Notably, binding of Cep192 or Cep152 to Plk4 did not appreciably influence the Plk4 kinase activity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Thus, these two scaffold proteins modulate Plk4-dependent centriole biogenesis by altering its bound states rather than its catalytic activity.</p>
        <p id="P32">Here we showed that two centrosomal scaffold proteins, Cep192 and Cep152, interact with Plk4 in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, thus ensuring timely formation of distinct Plk4 complexes at different subcentrosomal structures. In this regard, it is notable that the <italic>CEP152 E21K</italic> mutation found in human cancers crippled the Cep152-Plk4 interaction that led to a defect in procentriole assembly and chromosome segregation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3eâg</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4aâc</xref>). Similar defects were also observed with another cancer -associated, Plk4-binding defective, <italic>CEP152 V8A</italic> mutation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4dâh</xref>). These findings highlight the importance of converting Plk4 from a Cep192-tethered state (sequestered state) to a Cep152-bound state (procentriole assembly state) to properly regulate centriole duplication and mitotic progression.</p>
        <p id="P33">Scaffold proteins play diverse roles in various biological processes, such as insulating or tethering signaling components. However, unlike these somewhat passive roles, the two functionally distinct scaffolds that we described here operate in an opposite manner to shift a common binding target from one state to another and modulate its biological function. Incompatible binding modes and differential binding affinities are the basis of unidirectional scaffold switching that may serve as a new paradigm for understanding complex assembly processes involving multiple scaffold proteins.</p>

        <p>Experiments were designed and data interpreted by S.-Y.P., J.-E.P., T.-S.K, J.-H.K, M.-J.K., B.K., L.T. R.N.M., M.A., and S.K.. Crystal structures of apo-CPB structure (J.-H.K., and B.K.), the CPBâCep192-58mer complex (S.-Y.P., L.T., J.-H.K., B.K., and J.-E.P.), and the CPBâCep152-60mer complex (S.-Y.P., L.T., M.-J.K., B.K., and J.-E.P.) were determined independently. FP, 3D-SIM, and cell-based analyses were performed by J.-E.P., while all the biochemical analyses were performed by T.-S.K.. In addition, B.Y.K., J.K.B., H.H., and K.W.L. provided reagents and resources, and R.L.E., S.J.K., B.H.O., W.Y., and K.S.L. designed the experiments, interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.</p>

      <label>Figure 5</label>
      <caption>
        <p>A schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism of how Cep152 snatches Plk4 away from the Cep192âPlk4 complex and repositions Plk4 at the outer boundary of a newly formed Cep152 ring structure. Early G1 daughter centrioles are decorated with a cylindrical Cep192 structure, in which the N-terminus of Cep192 points outward (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). At this stage, Plk4 forms a smaller (~440 nm outer diameter) ring through the interaction with the N-terminal region of Cep192 (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). As Cep152 is being recruited to this location in late G1, Cep152 stochastically interacts with the Cep192-bound Plk4 and snatches the Plk4 away from the Cep192 scaffold (scaffold switching). Subsequent assembly of a Cep152 ring around the Cep192 toroid in an N-terminus outward fashion prompts the repositioning of Plk4 to the outer edge of the Cep152 ring, thus resulting in a much larger Plk4 ring structure in diameter (~600 nm). Around the time of procentriole formation, Plk4 assumes a dot-like signal at the future procentriole assembly site and recruits Sas6 to this site to induce centriole biogenesis.</p>
