      <abstract>
        <p>The rearrangement of pre-existing genes has long been thought of as the major mode of new gene generation. Recently, <italic>de novo</italic> gene birth from non-genic DNA was found to be an alternative mechanism to generate novel protein-coding genes. However, its functional role in human disease remains largely unknown. Here we show that <italic>NCYM</italic>, a <italic>cis</italic>-antisense gene of the <italic>MYCN</italic> oncogene, initially thought to be a large non-coding RNA, encodes a <italic>de novo</italic> evolved protein regulating the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly neuroblastoma. The <italic>NCYM</italic> gene is evolutionally conserved only in the taxonomic group containing humans and chimpanzees. In primary human neuroblastomas, <italic>NCYM</italic> is 100% co-amplified and co-expressed with <italic>MYCN</italic>, and <italic>NCYM</italic> mRNA expression is associated with poor clinical outcome. MYCN directly transactivates both <italic>NCYM</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic> mRNA, whereas NCYM stabilizes MYCN protein by inhibiting the activity of GSK3Î², a kinase that promotes MYCN degradation. In contrast to <italic>MYCN</italic> transgenic mice, neuroblastomas in <italic>MYCN/NCYM</italic> double transgenic mice were frequently accompanied by distant metastases, behavior reminiscent of human neuroblastomas with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification. The NCYM protein also interacts with GSK3Î², thereby stabilizing the MYCN protein in the tumors of the <italic>MYCN</italic>/<italic>NCYM</italic> double transgenic mice. Thus, these results suggest that GSK3Î² inhibition by NCYM stabilizes the MYCN protein both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the survival of <italic>MYCN</italic> transgenic mice bearing neuroblastoma was improved by treatment with NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor shown to destabilize MYCN via GSK3Î² activation. In contrast, tumors caused in <italic>MYCN/NCYM</italic> double transgenic mice showed chemo-resistance to the drug. Collectively, our results show that NCYM is the first <italic>de novo</italic> evolved protein known to act as an oncopromoting factor in human cancer, and suggest that <italic>de novo</italic> evolved proteins may functionally characterize human disease.</p>

        <p>The <italic>MYCN</italic> oncogene has a central role in the genesis and progression of neuroblastomas, and its amplification is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We have found that <italic>NCYM</italic>, a <italic>MYCN cis</italic>-antisense RNA, is translated in humans to a <italic>de novo</italic> evolved protein. NCYM inhibits GSK3Î² to stabilize MYCN, whereas MYCN induces <italic>NCYM</italic> transcription. The positive feedback regulation formed in the <italic>MYCN/NCYM</italic>-amplified tumors promotes the aggressive nature of human neuroblastoma. <italic>MYCN</italic> transgenic mice, which express human <italic>MYCN</italic> in sympathoadrenal tissues, spontaneously develop neuroblastomas. However, unlike human neuroblastoma, distant metastasis is infrequent. We established <italic>MYCN</italic>/<italic>NCYM</italic> double transgenic mice as a new animal model for studying neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We found that NCYM expression promoted both the metastasis and chemo-resistance of the neuroblastomas formed in the double transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that NCYM may be a potential target for developing novel therapeutic tools against high-risk neuroblastomas in humans, and that the <italic>MYCN</italic>/<italic>NCYM</italic> double transgenic mouse may be a suitable model for the screening of these new drugs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene evolution has long been thought to arise from pre-existing genes through duplication or rearrangement followed by rapid divergence <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Jacob1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003996-Khalturin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. <italic>De novo</italic> gene birth from non-coding genomic regions has been generally believed to be exceptionally rare <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Jacob1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, recent studies using genome-wide analyses have suggested the presence of a large number of <italic>de novo</italic> evolved genes in some species <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Tautz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Khalturin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003996-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, including primates <xref rid="pgen.1003996-TollRiera1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003996-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Studies in yeast revealed that the proteins produced from <italic>de novo</italic> genes were not insignificant polypeptides but functional proteins <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Carvunis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and that <italic>de novo</italic> gene birth could be a major mechanism of new gene generation <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Carvunis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In multicellular organisms, however, the functions of <italic>de novo</italic> evolved proteins have been poorly characterized <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Tautz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-OBleness1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and thus their pathophysiological significance has remained elusive. Therefore, it is still unclear whether <italic>de novo</italic> gene birth is a general mechanism throughout evolution for the creation of functional protein-coding genes.</p>
      <p>Neuroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in children. It originates from the neuronal precursor cells of the sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Brodeur1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Its clinical behavior is enigmatic; the tumors in patients of less than one year of age often regress spontaneously, whereas the tumors detected in patients over one year of age are usually aggressive and eventually cause the patient's death despite intensive multimodality therapies <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Brodeur1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The <italic>MYCN</italic> oncogene is frequently amplified in those tumors that occur in patients who are over one year of age at diagnosis <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Brodeur2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Schwab1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Transgenic mice expressing human <italic>MYCN</italic> in sympathoadrenal tissues spontaneously develop neuroblastomas <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>MYCN</italic> alone can initiate tumorigenesis and promote tumor growth. However, unlike human neuroblastoma, its distant metastasis is infrequent. Furthermore, in human neuroblastomas without <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, <italic>MYCN</italic> mRNA expression levels do not correlate with the prognosis of the patients <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Cohn1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Nakagawara1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, suggesting that additional events might contribute to the acquisition of increased aggressiveness. We focused on <italic>NCYM</italic> as a candidate gene that promotes the aggressiveness of <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastomas. <italic>NCYM</italic> is a <italic>cis</italic>-antisense gene of <italic>MYCN</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003996-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Krystal1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and is co-amplified with <italic>MYCN</italic> in human neuroblastoma cells. <italic>NCYM</italic> is transcribed in the opposite direction to <italic>MYCN</italic>, starting from intron 1 of the <italic>MYCN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and it has remained unclear for a long time whether the gene encodes a functional protein <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

<italic>NCYM</italic> is a <italic>de novo</italic> evolved gene</title>
        <p>We first analyzed the genomic sequence of <italic>NCYM</italic> in various species and found that in humans and chimpanzees the potential NCYM protein is composed of 109 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We next searched for paralogs and orthologs of the human NCYM protein among other animals using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) databases with an E-value threshold of 10<sup>â3</sup>. We did not find any paralogs, but identified orthologs for a probable NCYM protein in olive baboons, chimpanzees and pigmy chimpanzees. From here on, we focused on the <italic>NCYM</italic> gene of the hominidae to investigate the function of the protein product. The evolutionary rates between the indicated species suggest that the coding sequence of <italic>NCYM</italic> gene was exposed to positive selection in humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and the amino acid frequencies in these species were significantly different from the uniform usage of amino acids (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We next raised an antibody against the putative human NCYM protein, and identified a 12 to 15 kDa protein in human neuroblastoma cells which mainly localized to nuclei in <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The NCYM protein was expressed in a variety of normal human tissues, including the neuronal cells of the cerebrum and cerebellum, spermatocytes of the testis, pancreatic cells and also the heart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s005">Figure S5</xref>). NCYM was also localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s005">Figure S5AâD</xref>). NCYM was expressed in both primary and metastatic human neuroblastomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s005">Figure S5E and F</xref>), and was co-expressed with the MYCN protein in cells of human neuroblastomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g001">Figure 1D and E</xref>) and the neuronal cells of the human cerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g001">Figure 1F and G</xref>). It was also co-expressed with the MYCN protein in some primary human cancers, including thyroid cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, the NCYM protein is a <italic>de novo</italic> evolved gene product and is endogenously expressed in both normal human tissues and cancers.</p>

        <title>Prognostic significance of <italic>NCYM</italic> expression in human neuroblastoma</title>
        <p>We next examined the prognostic significance of <italic>NCYM</italic> mRNA expression in human neuroblastoma. The <italic>NCYM</italic> gene was co-amplified with the <italic>MYCN</italic> gene in all the cell lines and primary neuroblastomas we examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s007">Figure S7</xref>). <italic>NCYM</italic> expression levels were significantly correlated with that of <italic>MYCN</italic> in primary neuroblastomas (nâ=â106, <italic>P</italic>â=â4.69Ã10<sup>â16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and in the tumors with a single copy of <italic>MYCN</italic> (nâ=â86, <italic>P</italic>â=â1.11Ã10<sup>â13</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, high levels of <italic>NCYM</italic> mRNA expression were significantly associated with unfavorable prognostic factors (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s019">Table S1</xref>) and a poor outcome (<italic>P</italic>â=â3.70Ã10<sup>â5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), similar to that for <italic>MYCN</italic> mRNA expression (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s019">Table S1</xref> and <italic>P</italic>â=â2.31Ã10<sup>â5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

        <title>Positive feedback regulation between NCYM and MYCN</title>
        <p>The co-amplification and co-expression of <italic>NCYM</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic> in human primary neuroblastomas prompted us to investigate the functional interaction between NCYM and MYCN. Previously we have reported that MYCN directly targets its own expression in neuroblastoma cell lines <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Suenaga1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Because the promoter region of the <italic>NCYM</italic> gene is localized within intron 1 of <italic>MYCN</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s009">Figure S9A</xref>), we examined whether MYCN regulates <italic>NCYM</italic> transcription. Overexpression of MYCN in human neuroblastoma cells induced <italic>NCYM</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>MYCN</italic> downregulated endogenous <italic>NCYM</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). MYC overexpression did not induce either <italic>MYCN</italic> or <italic>NCYM</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). However, MYCN overexpression did enhance <italic>NCYM</italic> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that MYCN, but not MYC, activates the transcription of <italic>NCYM</italic>. Putative E-boxes exist in intron 1 of the <italic>MYCN</italic> gene; however, it is unclear whether they are responsible for this feedback regulation. We therefore generated constructs containing different lengths of the MYCN intron 1 region and performed luciferase assays to identify the MYCN-responsive region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s009">Figure S9C</xref>). MYCN enhances its own promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner when co-transfected with reporter plasmids containing the NCYM promoter region (from +1073 to +1312). However, when co-transfected with plasmids without this NCYM promoter region, MYCN positive autoregulation was diminished. Within this region, there is a putative E-box located just 2 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of the <italic>NCYM</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s010">Figure S10A</xref>). We generated constructs containing the NCYM promoter region comprising either a wild-type or a mutant E-box. Overexpression of MYCN enhanced NCYM wild-type promoter activity, but mutation of the E-box diminished its activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s010">Figure S10C</xref>). MYC overexpression did not activate either of the NCYM promoter constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s010">Figure S10B and C</xref>). Therefore, these results indicate that MYCN enhances NCYM promoter activity in an E-box-dependent manner. MYC, however, is not involved in <italic>NCYM</italic> transcription.</p>

        <p>We next investigated the function of NCYM in neuroblastoma cells. NCYM overexpression induced MYCN protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s011">Figure S11A</xref>), but had no effect on the mRNA levels of <italic>MYCN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s011">Figure S11A</xref>). Consistent with these results, shRNA-mediated knockdown of NCYM significantly downregulated the amount of MYCN protein without affecting the level of <italic>MYCN</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, knockdown of NCYM decreased the stability of the MYCN protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s011">Figure S11B</xref>). This NCYM knockdown-mediated destabilization of MYCN could be inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s011">Figure S11C</xref>). It is known that the stability of the MYCN protein is regulated by a series of phosphorylation and ubiquitination events that are required for its recognition by the proteasome <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Gustafson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. CDK1/Cyclin B1 phosphorylates MYCN at serine 62: the mono-phosphorylated MYCN is then recognized by GSK3Î² and subsequently phosphorylated at threonine 58, leading to its proteasome-dependent protein degradation after an E3-mediated polyubiquitination <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Gustafson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Sjostrom1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Therefore, using immunoprecipitation, we next searched for factors interacting with NCYM that are able to induce MYCN stabilization, and found that NCYM forms a complex with MYCN and GSK3Î² in CHP134 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3F and G</xref>). In addition, purified NCYM was capable of interacting with purified GSK3Î² and MYCN <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). To examine the effect of NCYM on GSK3Î²-mediated phosphorylation of MYCN, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003996-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). NCYM protein inhibited the phosphorylation of MYCN. Because the purified NCYM protein is not a substrate of GSK3Î² (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s012">Figure S12</xref>), it is unlikely that NCYM competes with MYCN for GSK3Î² as a substrate. Taken together these results suggest that the NCYM protein inhibits GSK3Î²-mediated MYCN phosphorylation and stabilizes the MYCN protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
        <p>It has been reported that MYCN knockdown decreases cell proliferation and induces apoptosis and/or differentiation in <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma cells <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results reveal that <italic>NCYM</italic>, which was initially thought to be a large non-coding RNA transcribed from a <italic>cis</italic>-antisense gene of human <italic>MYCN</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003996-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, is actually translated into a functional protein in humans. <italic>MYCN</italic> is a highly conserved, major oncogene in human cancer. The newly evolved <italic>cis</italic>-antisense <italic>NCYM</italic> gene product targets the sense <italic>MYCN</italic> gene product, influencing its stabilization, which in turn enhances transcription of the <italic>NCYM</italic> gene. This positive autoregulatory loop may function in primary human neuroblastomas to enhance metastasis as well as drug resistance through stabilization of MYCN and even Î²-catenin, which are mediated by inhibition of GSK3Î² (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s018">Figure S18</xref>). Thus, NCYM is the first <italic>de novo</italic> evolved gene product shown to function in the development of human neuroblastoma.</p>
      <p>NCYM promoted phosphorylation of GSK3Î² at serine 9 possibly via the activation of mTOR-S6K signaling, that might have led to the constitutive inactivation of GSK3Î² <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recently, Schramm <italic>et al.</italic> reported that MYCN transcriptionally regulates the mTOR pathway, promoting its activation <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Schramm1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus, MYCN might have enhanced S6K phosphorylation by activating the mTOR pathway in neuroblastomas caused in the double transgenic mice. Previous reports have suggested that neuroblastoma cell lines expressing high levels of MYCN were significantly more sensitive to mTOR inhibitors compared with cell lines expressing low MYCN levels <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, our study showed that NCYM knockdown significantly induces apoptosis in <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma cells, whereas the effects were marginal in <italic>MYCN</italic>-single neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, the feedback regulation between mTOR-S6K signaling and MYCN/NCYM may contribute to the survival of <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s018">Figure S18</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although NCYM inhibits GSK3Î²-mediated MYCN phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, our data does not rule out the possibility that NCYM may stabilize MYCN in a GSK3Î²-independent manner. Because NCYM binds directly to MYCN both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in neuroblastoma cells, this may affect the recruitment of the regulators of MYCN stability. Indeed, we have recently found that the tumor suppressor protein Runx3 directly binds to MYCN in neuroblastoma cells and promotes degradation of MYCN in the ubiquitinâproteasome system dependent manner <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the binding of NCYM to MYCN itself could affect the interaction of Runx3, or other regulators such as Aurora A <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Otto1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> with MYCN to induce its stability. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of NCYM-mediated inhibition of GSK3Î² activity on MYCN stability.</p>
      <p>Recent reports have suggested that both mutant ALK <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Heukamp1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and Lin28B <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Molenaar1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> promote the growth of neuroblastomas in transgenic mouse models by targeting MYCN for stabilization <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Heukamp1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> or overexpression <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Molenaar1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Among the known regulators of MYCN, <italic>NCYM</italic> is the only gene that shows 100% co-amplification with <italic>MYCN</italic> in human primary neuroblastomas. Overexpressed NCYM stabilizes both MYCN and Î²-catenin, and enhances the generation of neuroblastomas with increased aggressive behavior such as distant metastasis and/or drug resistance, which are characteristics reminiscent of human neuroblastoma. Recently, Valentijn <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that the activation of the MYCN pathway is a more significant prognostic factor than the expression or amplification of MYCN in primary neuroblastomas <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Valentijn1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Consistent with this, our results indicate that <italic>NCYM</italic> expression is associated with poor outcomes in human neuroblastoma regardless of genomic status of the <italic>MYCN</italic>/<italic>NCYM</italic> locus. Therefore, we anticipate that the positive auto-regulatory loop formed by MYCN and NCYM may be a promising target for developing novel therapeutic tools against high-risk neuroblastoma.</p>
      <p>As suggested in the recent report <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the concomitant inhibition of apoptosis and/or activation of survival signals may be required for MYCN to induce multiple tumors or metastases <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we found that NCYM maintains the survival of <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma cells, and that the apoptotic cell number, indicated by cleaved caspase-3, was downregulated in <italic>MYCN/NCYM</italic> transgenic mice. In addition, GSK3Î² inhibition contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis in response to treatment with DNA-damaging drugs in neuroblastoma cells <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Therefore, the concomitant activation of other GSK3Î² substrates, such as Î²-catenin, and mTOR-S6K signaling by NCYM may be involved in the inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003996.s018">Figure S18</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since the proposals of Ohno and Jacob, the birth of a new gene has been believed to be caused by the duplication or rearrangement of pre-existing genes <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Jacob1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The recent advances in whole genome sequencing technology and bioinformatics have identified the presence of <italic>de novo</italic> proteins; however, their physiological or pathological significance have largely remained unclear <xref rid="pgen.1003996-Tautz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003996-OBleness1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In 2010, Li <italic>et al.</italic> reported that MDF1 originated <italic>de novo</italic> from a DNA sequence previously thought to be non-coding in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003996-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. MDF1 inhibits mating efficiency by binding MATÎ±2 and promoting vegetative growth. Therefore, while MDF1 was the first reported <italic>de novo</italic> gene whose protein product function was unveiled in a monad, NCYM may be the first <italic>de novo</italic> protein whose precise function has been clarified in multicellular organisms, specifically in humans.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, NCYM is a <italic>de novo</italic> evolved protein which acts as an oncopromoting factor in human neuroblastoma. Our results suggest that <italic>de novo</italic> evolved new gene products may be involved in the functional regulation of human cancers and even other diseases.</p>
