      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in the human LIS1 gene cause type I lissencephaly, a severe brain developmental disease involving gross disorganization of cortical neurons. In lower eukaryotes, LIS1 participates in cytoplasmic dynein-mediated nuclear migration. We previously reported that mammalian LIS1 functions in cell division and coimmunoprecipitates with cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin. We also localized LIS1 to the cell cortex and kinetochores of mitotic cells, known sites of dynein action. We now find that the COOH-terminal WD repeat region of LIS1 is sufficient for kinetochore targeting. Overexpression of this domain or full-length LIS1 displaces CLIP-170 from this site without affecting dynein and other kinetochore markers. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal self-association domain of LIS1 displaces endogenous LIS1 from the kinetochore, with no effect on CLIP-170, dynein, and dynactin. Displacement of the latter proteins by dynamitin overexpression, however, removes LIS1, suggesting that LIS1 binds to the kinetochore through the motor protein complexes and may interact with them directly. We find that of 12 distinct dynein and dynactin subunits, the dynein heavy and intermediate chains, as well as dynamitin, interact with the WD repeat region of LIS1 in coexpression/coimmunoprecipitation and two-hybrid assays. Within the heavy chain, interactions are with the first AAA repeat, a site strongly implicated in motor function, and the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cargo-binding region. Together, our data suggest a novel role for LIS1 in mediating CLIP-170âdynein interactions and in coordinating dynein cargo-binding and motor activities.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mutations in the human LIS1 gene are responsible for the autosomal dominant brain developmental disease, type I lissencephaly (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Reiner et al., 1993</xref>). This condition involves gross disorganization of neurons within the cerebral cortex, and is thought to reflect a failure in normal neuronal migration during early development.</p>
      <p>Genetic studies in lower eukaryotes have indicated that LIS1 homologues participate in dynein-mediated nuclear migration (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Geiser et al., 1997</xref>). In vertebrates, LIS1 was initially identified as a noncatalytic subunit of brain platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hattori et al., 1993</xref>). We, and others, have more recently found LIS1 to interact biochemically with cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). We also obtained evidence for a role for LIS1 in vertebrate cell division, raising the possibility that the errors in neuronal distribution characteristic of lissencephaly arise from defects in the genesis of neuronal progenitors (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). Overexpression of LIS1, application of LIS1 antisense oligonucleotides, and microinjection of anti-LIS1 antibody all produced potent mitotic defects, including spindle misorientation and chromosome misalignment at the metaphase plate. Consistent with a mitotic function, LIS1 localized prominently to prometaphase kinetochores and to the cell cortex of dividing vertebrate cultured cells, known binding sites for cytoplasmic dynein and its accessory complex, dynactin.</p>
      <p>The molecular relationship between dynein, dynactin, and LIS1 is poorly understood. Dynein and dynactin are each large, multisubunit complexes. Dynein consists of a heavy chain (HC), responsible for ATPase activity and force production, plus a variety of accessory subunits (intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains; ICs, LICs, and LCs) implicated in binding to diverse forms of subcellular cargo (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tynan et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Tai et al., 2001</xref>). Dynactin consists of a short filament of the actin-related protein Arp1 and a variety of associated polypeptides. Dynactin has been found to link dynein to the prometaphase kinetochore (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>) and the surface of Golgi membranes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Roghi and Allan, 1999</xref>), suggesting that it participates in dynein cargo binding. Dynactin has also been reported to stimulate dynein processivity (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">King and Schroer, 2000</xref>). The ICs of cytoplasmic dynein interact directly with the p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic> subunit of dynactin in in vitro assays (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Karki and Holzbaur, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>). However, the interaction between the two intact complexes has been observed only at very limited levels (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kini and Collins, 2001</xref>), suggesting that it is weak or regulated (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan et al., 2001</xref>). LIS1 has been reported to interact with a portion of the cytoplasmic dynein HC in yeast two-hybrid and coexpression/coimmunoprecipitation assays (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>). Whether it interacts with other subunits of dynein, whether it interacts with dynactin independently, and how these interactions relate to dynein function and subcellular organization are poorly understood.</p>
      <p>How the structural organization of LIS1 relates to its function is also poorly understood. LIS1 is predicted to consist of two distinct domains. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 97 amino acids (aa) contains a short region of predicted coiled-coil that has been implicated in self-association (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn and Morris, 2001</xref>). The COOH-terminal 317 aa contains a series of seven WD repeats, which in the Î² subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins and other polypeptides constitute a Î²-propeller fold (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 1995</xref>). COOH-terminal deletions of LIS1 are sufficient to cause lissencephaly (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2000</xref>), indicating that the WD repeat domain is important functionally. This region has been implicated in binding to the catalytic subunit of PAFAH (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>). Whether this is its sole function, or whether it also functions in the dynein pathway is unknown. LIS1 has been reported to interact with two additional classes of protein in the dynein pathway, NudC and NudE/NudEL (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Efimov and Morris, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>), but their role in LIS1 function and their binding sites within LIS1 are uncertain.</p>
      <p>We report here that LIS1 associates with kinetochores through its WD repeat domain. Using dominant inhibitory dynactin and LIS1 constructs, we find LIS1 to be linked to the kinetochore through the motor protein complexes, rather than the reverse. We find that the WD repeat domain of LIS1 interacts with three distinct subunits of the dynein and dynactin complexes, representing both motor and cargo-binding regions. Overexpression of full-length LIS1 and its WD repeat fragment specifically displaced CLIP-170 from mitotic kinetochores. Together, these results suggest a direct role for LIS1 in novel forms of dynein/dynactin regulation.</p>

        <title>Phenotypic effects of LIS1 fragments</title>
        <p>Previous work from this lab implicated LIS1 in mitotic chromosome alignment and spindle orientation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). To determine which portion of the LIS1 molecule is involved in these activities, we constructed two cDNAs encoding HA-tagged fragments of LIS1 corresponding to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 87 aa, comparable to the 89-aa product resulting from a known disease-causing deletion (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2000</xref>), and the COOH-terminal 327 aa, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment contains a 28-aa predicted coiled-coil domain, whereas the COOH-terminal fragment contains seven WD repeat motifs. To our surprise, overexpression of each fragment produced a dramatic increase in mitotic index comparable to that observed with full-length LIS1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), with a greater number of multipolar spindles and a more dramatic disruption of spindle organization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). The more severe phenotype is reminiscent of that produced by overexpression of the dynamitin subunit of dynactin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>). However, as reported previously for full-length LIS1 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>) and unlike dynamitin, no effect on Golgi morphology was detectable with the LIS1 fragments (unpublished data).</p>

Cell cycle stage was scored for nontransfected control cells (control), cells overexpressing full-length LIS1 (Ox LIS1 FL), and the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal fragments (Ox LIS1 N and Ox LIS1 WD). Full-length LIS1 and NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal fragments all produced similar pronounced increases in mitotic index.

        </fig>
        <p>To gain insight into the manner in which the individual fragments produced these effects, we examined their ability to associate with prometaphase kinetochores, a site at which we had previously observed endogenous LIS1 using immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). We also treated cells with nocodazole, which allows outer kinetochore components to accumulate above their normal levels (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>). Full-length HA-tagged LIS1 exhibited dramatic localization to prometaphase kinetochores, identified by costaining with CREST human autoimmune antiserum in both COS-7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, upper row) and HeLa cells (unpublished data), adding strong support to the identification of LIS1 as a kinetochore component. Within the kinetochore, LIS1 staining was slightly peripheral to the CREST signal, consistent with outer kinetochore localization. In cells exposed to nocodazole for prolonged periods (see below), LIS1 exhibited an elongated crescent shape, as observed for dynein and other outer kinetochore components (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>). Clear kinetochore localization was also observed with the WD repeat fragment of LIS1 alone. This effect was more pronounced in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, middle row), but was also readily observed in untreated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). In contrast, specific localization of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal LIS1 fragment (LIS1 N) was not generally observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, lower row), though very weak kinetochore staining could be detected in occasional cells (unpublished data). Together, these results indicate that the WD repeat domain of LIS1 is sufficient for kinetochore targeting.</p>

        <title>Hierarchy of LIS1 interactions at the kinetochore</title>
        <p>Despite this difference in kinetochore binding behavior, the two fragments produce phenotypes of comparable severity (see above). The NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of the LIS1-related <italic>Aspergillus</italic> protein NudF has been implicated in self-association (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn and Morris, 2001</xref>), raising the possibility that the corresponding portion of LIS1 might interact with the endogenous full-length protein and interfere with its behavior. In coexpression experiments, we observed the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment coimmunoprecipitating with itself and full-length LIS1, but not with the WD region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). In contrast to previous results with <italic>NudF</italic>, removal of the predicted coiled-coil (HAâLIS1ÎC-C) had no effect on self-association, suggesting that the entire NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain participates in this activity. To determine whether the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain can displace the endogenous wild-type protein from kinetochores, we examined cells overexpressing the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal construct for endogenous LIS1 staining. For this purpose, we used a monoclonal antibody (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sapir et al., 1997</xref>) that we determined to react with the WD repeat region of LIS1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). In high expressers, the endogenous LIS1 kinetochore staining was, indeed, dramatically reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C, right column).</p>

<bold>Effects of LIS1 fragments on kinetochore composition.</bold> (A) Self-association of LIS1 N. Myc-tagged LIS1 full-length cDNA was coexpressed with different HA-tagged LIS1 fragments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and an HA-tagged LIS1 coiled-coil deletion construct (HAâLIS1 ÎC-C), and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-myc antibody. Clear coimmunoprecipitation was observed only between constructs including the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of LIS1. (B) Specificity of LIS1 monoclonal antibody for WD repeat region. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged LIS1 constructs. Cell lysates were loaded into 5â15% gradient gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA monoclonal antibody, which recognized all LIS1 constructs, and monoclonal anti-LIS1 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sapir et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). The latter recognized endogenous and full-length HAâLIS1 (arrow), as well as the slightly smaller WD repeat fragment, but not the 10-kD LIS1 N (open arrowhead). (C) Effect of LIS1 N on endogenous LIS1 localization. In contrast to nontransfected cells, endogenous LIS1 protein detected with the LIS1 monoclonal antibody was displaced from kinetochores by LIS1 N overexpression. (D) Effect of LIS1 N and LIS1 WD on endogenous dynein IC localization. Dynein staining at the kinetochore persisted in cells overexpressing either fragment. Bars, 5 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>We previously reported that dynein and dynactin remain at the prometaphase kinetochore in LIS1-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>), though our current data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) indicate that the full-length epitope-tagged LIS1 protein occupies the kinetochore under these conditions. To test the effects of removing endogenous LIS1 from this site, we overexpressed LIS1 N. No effect on the dynein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D) and dynactin (unpublished data) signals was observed in cells overexpressing the LIS1 fragment versus untransfected cells (unpublished data).</p>

No effect was observed, except in the case of CLIP-170, which was completely displaced by the full-length and WD repeat LIS1 constructs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; unpublished data).</p>

        <p>To test whether LIS1 requires dynein/dynactin for kinetochore binding, we overexpressed the dynamitin subunit of dynactin, which dissociates dynactin into smaller subcomplexes and releases dynein from the kinetochore (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>). We now find that epitope-tagged dynamitin persists at the kinetochore under these conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). This behavior suggests an additional effect of dynamitin overexpression: competition for binding to the dynein/dynactin anchoring protein ZW10 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 1998</xref>). As expected, Arp1, a dynactin subunit, was displaced from the kinetochore (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B, upper left). The LIS1 signal was also greatly diminished (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B, upper right).

        <title>LIS1 interacts through its WD repeat domain with multiple sites in dynein and dynactin</title>
        <p>The dependence of LIS1 kinetochore targeting on dynein and dynactin supports a physiological interaction with the two complexes. To define the molecular basis for these interactions further, we explored whether LIS1 can interact with subunits in each complex. LIS1 was coexpressed with cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin subunits, and interactions were assessed by coimmunoprecipitation.</p>
        <p>Both the HCs and ICs of cytoplasmic dynein coimmunoprecipitated with LIS1, as did the dynamitin subunit of dynactin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). LIC1 and LIC2 and LCs (Tctex-1, RP3, and LC8) of the dynein complex, and the p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic>, Arp1, and p62 subunits of the dynactin complex were all negative in this assay. These results indicate that LIS1 interacts with each complex independently and, in the case of cytoplasmic dynein, through multiple subunit interactions. We also examined these interactions by immunoprecipitation from [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled total cell extracts. In each case (HC, IC2C, and dynamitin), LIS1 was the major nondynein/dynactin polypeptide pulled down, with minor background bands also visible (unpublished data).</p>

In the case of the HC, three fragments were analyzed for interactions. HC N649C907 and HC N1874C2124 showed positive reactions, whereas HC N547C649 did not (see next section for further detail). Thus, together our data support a direct interaction between LIS1 and each of three distinct dynein and dynactin subunits.</p>
        <p>To gain further insight into the molecular basis for the observed interactions, we investigated which region of LIS1 is involved. No interaction was detected using LIS1 N.

        <title>Two distinct sites of the HC interact with LIS1</title>
        <p>The dynein HC consists of two major functional regions. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal aa 1100â1300 are thought to constitute the âstemâ of the molecule, and contain the known sites for interaction with the cargo-binding ICs, LICs, and LCs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Habura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tynan et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mok et al., 2001</xref>). The remainder of the molecule represents the motor domain. The site for microtubule binding is located at the tip of a projecting stalk (aa 3160â3506; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997</xref>), which resides within a series of recently predicted AAA ATPase domains (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>). Photocleavage (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons and Gibbons, 1987</xref>) or mutation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997</xref>) of the P-loop of the first AAA domain abolishes ATPase activity, implicating this site most clearly in ATP hydrolysis and force production.</p>
        <p>The identity of the site within the HC with which LIS1 interacts should provide important insight into LIS1 function. To investigate this issue systematically, we coexpressed LIS1 with a series of motor domain and stem fragments and subfragments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Surprisingly, clear binding was observed with HC fragments corresponding to each major domain (e.g., N1137flag corresponding to the entire motor domain and C1140myc corresponding to the stem domain). Analysis of subfragments of the motor domain indicated that one LIS1 binding site is located toward the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of this region. During the course of this study a LIS1-binding fragment from the same region encompassing part, but not all, of the first two AAA domains was also identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>). Recently, the same fragment was also found to interact with the <italic>Aspergillus</italic> LIS1 homologue NUDF (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2001</xref>). To determine whether the LIS1 binding site corresponded to a predicted HC functional domain, we designed a fragment (N1874C2124flag) corresponding to the boundaries of the first AAA repeat (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Neuwald et al., 1999</xref>). Clear binding with LIS1 was observed. To determine whether LIS1 binding is affected by ATP binding state, full-length HC and AAA domain constructs containing K to E mutations in the first P-loop element were tested (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>, K1910Eflag and N1874C2124<sup>K1910E</sup>flag). No effect on LIS1 binding was detected, indicating that the LIS1âHC interaction does not require a functional ATPase site.</p>

        <title>Distinct roles for LIS1 domains</title>
        <p>As for full-length LIS1, overexpression of the LIS1 N and WD repeat domains produced pronounced increases in mitotic index. Neither fragment affected Golgi organization (compare with <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), again indicating a role in a restricted range of dynein functions (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region is involved in self-association (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn and Morris, 2001</xref>), but, so far, not in interactions with dynein, dynactin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), Î±-PAFAH, or NudEL (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain failed to bind to kinetochores, but displaced endogenous full-length LIS1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We suggest that this behavior is likely to reflect a weakened affinity of the of LIS1 N/full-length LIS1 heterodimer for kinetochores. The resulting loss of endogenous LIS1 from this and, potentially, other sites seems likely to contribute to the mitotic phenotype.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the WD repeat fragment showed no evidence of self-association, mediated all of the heterologous LIS1 interactions identified in this study, and targeted to kinetochores very efficiently (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). The mechanism by which this region affects mitosis may involve competition with full-length LIS1 for dynein and dynactin binding, and displacement of CLIP-170 from the kinetochore (see below). Although Î±-PAFAH interacts with the WD repeat region of LIS1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sweeney et al., 2000</xref>), it was undetectable in our cell lysates (unpublished data) and fails to associate with dynein (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>; unpublished data). It cannot, therefore, account for the mitotic effects we observed. The precise sites of LIS1 interaction with NudE, NudEL, and NudC are not known, nor has their fate been determined in LIS1-overexpressing cells.</p>

        <title>Role of LIS1 in kinetochore organization and function</title>
        <p>As in the case of full-length LIS1 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>), the fragments failed to displace dynein and dynactin from the kinetochore despite the efficient displacement of endogenous LIS1 by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment. The latter result argues strongly against a role for LIS1 in anchoring dynein and dynactin at the kinetochore. Conversely, LIS1 was displaced by dynamitin overexpression, which removes dynein and dynactin from the kinetochore. Together, our results are most clearly consistent with a model in which LIS1 is linked to the kinetochore through either dynein, dynactin, or both (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> A).</p>

For clarity, dynactin is represented only by its dynamitin (p50) and p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic> subunits, and dynein only by its HCs and ICs, and the interaction of the HC with microtubules is omitted. CLIP-170 associates with the kinetochore through dynein and dynactin, but the specific link is unknown. LIS1 is found in the current study to interact with p50, HC, and IC. Overexpression of dynamitin (dotted orange line) removes all polypeptides depicted downstream. Overexpression of either full-length LIS1 or LIS1 WD (dotted green line) has no effect on the association of dynein and dynactin with the kinetochore, but dissociates CLIP-170 from this site and interferes with the interaction of p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic> with microtubules (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). Further potential direct effects of overexpressed LIS1 or LIS1 fragments on dynein and dynactin subunits are discussed in the text. (B) Interaction of LIS1 with two dynein HC sites.

        <p>CLIP-170 was displaced from kinetochores by overexpression of LIS1 or its WD domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Because CLIP-170 can also be displaced by dynamitin overexpression, it is likely to associate with the kinetochore indirectly through dynein or dynactin (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Dujardin et al., 1998</xref>). LIS1 overexpression appears to interfere with the latter link (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that LIS1 may mediate the interaction between CLIP-170 and the motor protein complexes. Although this is an appealing model, it is disputed by the effects of LIS1 N overexpression, which displaces endogenous LIS1 from the kinetochore (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C) without affecting CLIP-170 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>All three LIS1 constructs produce more severe accumulation of cells in mitosis and more dramatic alterations in spindle morphology than are generated by a dominant-negative CLIP-170 fragment (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Dujardin et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting a greater overlap in LIS1 and dynein functions. Loss of CLIP-170 almost certainly contributes to the LIS1 or LIS1 WD overexpression phenotypes, but is unlikely to explain fully the greater range of LIS1 phenotypic defects. It is uncertain whether this difference reflects a role for LIS1 in a wider range of mitotic dynein functions than CLIP-170. Our evidence for an interaction between LIS1 and subunits of dynein and dynactin suggests a direct form of regulation in which CLIP-170 is unlikely to participate. In this regard, we have already found that LIS1 displaces the p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic> subunit of dynactin from growing microtubule ends (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> A; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>), an effect that may weaken the interaction between kinetochores and microtubules during mitosis. It remains to be seen whether displacement of CLIP-170 from the kinetochore, which has similar microtubule-binding properties to those of p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic>, has redundant or additive effects (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> A).</p>

        <title>LIS1 interactions with dynein and dynactin</title>
        <p>We have found LIS1 to interact with three different polypeptides, two in the dynein complex and a third in the dynactin complex. The ability of LIS1 to interact with subunits of both cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin suggests an important new role in linking the two complexes together. Despite extensive genetic and biochemical evidence for an interaction between the dynein IC and p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic> subunits (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Karki and Holzbaur, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">McGrail et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>), only limited evidence for the copurification of the complexes has been obtained (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Paschal et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kini and Collins, 2001</xref>). Phosphorylation of the ICs has recently been reported to regulate this interaction (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan et al., 2001</xref>), and the current study suggests that LIS1 acts as a protein cofactor that may also contribute to the stability of the cocomplex.</p>
        <p>The association of LIS1 with the first AAA domain of the dynein HC strongly predicts an additional role in regulating motor activity. Although the mechanism by which the multiple dynein AAA domains coordinate their behavior to produce force and transmit it through the stalk is not understood, the importance of the first AAA domain has been clearly demonstrated (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gibbons and Gibbons, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, LIS1 interacts with both cargo-binding and force-producing regions of dynein itself, as well as with dynactin, suggesting a role for LIS1 in complex and novel forms of regulation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> B). Conceivably, LIS1 might serve to signal whether the dynein complex is associated with cargo (such as the mitotic kinetochore) and regulate motor activity accordingly. Alternatively, it could serve to stiffen the linkage between the stem and motor domains of dynein via a mechanism reminiscent of the role of LCs in stabilizing the myosin neck region (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lowey et al., 1993</xref>). Further study of the functional properties of LIS1 is likely to provide important new insight not only into mechanisms of brain development, but into dynein regulation and function as well.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
        <p>COS-7 and HeLa cells were grown in DME with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO BRL). For transient transfections, cells were plated either on a 10-cm petri dish or onto 18-mm coverslips to 70â80% confluency, and then were transfected with the appropriate amount of DNA mixed with lipofectAMINE (for 10-cm dish) or lipofectAMINE PLUS (coverslips) (GIBCO BRL). Transient expression was allowed for 40â48 h.</p>

        <title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
        <p>The coimmunoprecipitation procedure was described previously (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tynan et al., 2000b</xref>). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA, purified from either Qiagen Maxiprep or QIAprep Spin miniprep kits (QIAGEN), and LipofectAMINE reagents overnight at 37Â°C. 48 h after the addition of the DNAâliposome mixture, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with modified RIPA buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% IGEPAL CA-630), containing a protease inhibitor mixture (2 Î¼g/ml of aprotinin and leupeptin [Sigma-Aldrich] and 1 mM AEBSF [Roche Molecular Biochemicals]). Cells were then incubated on ice for 20 min and spun at 13,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min in a microfuge (Eppendorf). Protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or flag M2 affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used for all immunoprecipitations. Extracts were mixed with RIPA-washed beads and incubated at 4Â°C overnight with gentle rotation. Beads were then washed three times with RIPA at room temperature, 10 min each, and boiled in 5Ã SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The entire eluates with 4% supernatant were loaded into 5â15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed with various antibodies against tags or specific proteins.</p>

        <title>Yeast two-hybrid assay</title>
        <p>The LexA-based two-hybrid assay (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gyuris et al., 1993</xref>) was used to assess interactions between LIS1 fragments and various dynein/dynactin subunits, including IC2C, dynamitin, HC N547C649, HC N748C907, and HC N1874C2124. All LIS1 fragments were cloned into the pEG202 bait vector by PCR and tested for auto-activation of the reporter. The LIS1 N bait construct activated the reporter in the absence of prey and was omitted in the two-hybrid assay. IC2C, dynamitin, and HC fragments were cloned into pJG4-5 prey vector by PCR. Interactions were scored using the Î²-galactosidase filter assay.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
        <p>For kinetochore staining, cells were either unextracted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A) or extracted with 0.5% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) or 0.01% Triton X-100 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 min and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (EMS) in PHEM buffer (120 mM Pipes, 50 mM Hepes, 20 mM EGTA, 4 mM magnesium acetate, pH 6.9) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with â20Â°C methanol for 4 min. All primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed at 37Â°C for 1 h. After all antibody incubations, cells were incubated with 0.1 Î¼g/ml of DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min before mounting with Prolong Antifade solution (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Immunofluorescence images were obtained using a Leica DM IRBE microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA 100 CCD camera and processed by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope, using a Bio-Rad Laboratories MRC1000 system with a Kr/Ar laser. Each image was obtained from the total projection (20â24 stacks, 0.3 Î¼m/step), and background subtraction was processed by the MetaMorph software after the image was pseudocolored and cropped by Adobe Photoshop<sup>Â®</sup> 5.5 (Adobe Systems, Inc.) and Corel Draw 9.0 (Corel Corp.).</p>
