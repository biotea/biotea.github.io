      <abstract>
        <p>Proteins localized to the basal body and the centrosome play crucial roles in ciliary assembly and function. Although RABL2 and CEP19 are conserved in ciliated organisms and have been implicated in ciliary/flagellar functions, their roles are poorly understood. Here we show that RABL2 interacts with CEP19 and is recruited to the mother centriole and basal body in a CEP19-dependent manner and that CEP19 is recruited to the centriole probably via its binding to the centrosomal protein FGFR1OP. Disruption of the <italic>RABL2</italic> gene in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> results in the nonflagellated phenotype, suggesting a crucial role of RABL2 in ciliary/flagellar assembly. We also show that RABL2 interacts, in its GTP-bound state, with the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex via the IFT74âIFT81 heterodimer and that the interaction is disrupted by a mutation found in male infertile mice (<italic>Mot</italic> mice) with a sperm flagella motility defect. Intriguingly, RABL2 binds to CEP19 and the IFT74âIFT81 heterodimer in a mutually exclusive manner. Furthermore, exogenous expression of the GDP-locked or <italic>Mot</italic>-type RABL2 mutant in human cells results in mild defects in ciliary assembly. These results indicate that RABL2 localized to the basal body plays crucial roles in ciliary/flagellar assembly via its interaction with the IFT-B complex.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The centrosome is an organelle that is assembled from a pair of centrioles arranged in an L-shaped configuration and surrounded by a dense matrix of pericentriolar material. In interphase cells, the centrosome is located near the nucleus and serves as an organizing center for intracellular microtubules, and in the mitotic phase, bipolar mitotic spindles assemble on the duplicated centrosomes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>). When cells enter the G<sub>0</sub> phase, one of the centrioles serves as the basal body beneath the plasma membrane to project the cilium. This hair-like structure is categorized into two types: motile cilia, which are present in limited types of cells, such as those of airway epithelial cells, ventricle ependymal cells, and sperm flagella; and immotile cilia (also called primary cilia), which are present in almost all cells and serve as cellular antennae to receive and transduce a wide variety of extracellular signals. The assembly and function of cilia require the selective trafficking of various proteins into and out of cilia, including tubulins and signaling proteins. Ciliary protein trafficking is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, often referred to as the IFT train, which is composed of the IFT-B complex, involved in anterograde trafficking, and the IFT-A complex, involved in retrograde trafficking (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sung and Leroux, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). Defects in the assembly and function of cilia, including those in the IFT machinery, cause various genetic diseases collectively called ciliopathies. These include BardetâBiedl syndrome (BBS), Joubert syndrome (JBTS), Meckel syndrome, and nephronophthisis, with a wide spectrum of symptoms, such as polycystic kidney, retinal degeneration, obesity, infertility, and brain and skeletal malformation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Witman, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Madhivanan and Aguilar, 2014</xref>). The molecular basis of these phenotypes is largely unknown.</p><p>Small GTPases belonging to the ARF/ARL and RAB families function as molecular switches by cycling between a GDP-bound, inactive state and a GTP-bound, active state and directly or indirectly regulate various cellular processes, including protein trafficking and cell division. Various ARF/ARL and RAB GTPases also play crucial roles in centrosomal functions and ciliary protein trafficking. These include ARF4, ARL2, ARL3, ARL6/BBS3, ARL13B/JBTS8, RAB8, RAB10, RAB11, RAB23, and RAB28 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Hu, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lim <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). There are also RAB-like (RABL) GTPases, which are similar to RAB GTPases but lack a canonical C-terminal isoprenylation site found in the RAB GTPases (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rojas <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Among them, RABL4 and RABL5, also known as IFT27/BBS19 and IFT22, respectively, are components of the IFT-B complex (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Hu, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lim <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Katoh <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; see later discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8L</xref>); RABL4/IFT27/BBS19 has been proposed to serve as a functional linker between two multiprotein complexes involved in ciliary protein trafficking, namely, the IFT-B and BBSome (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Eguether <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liew <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we focus on RABL2 for the following reasons: 1) the <italic>RABL2</italic> gene is conserved in species that have motile cilia/flagella, and it was reported that the expression level of RABL2 is higher in ciliated than in nonciliated cells (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hoh <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>); 2) male mice with a point mutation in RABL2 (<italic>Mot</italic> mice) were reported to be sterile as a consequence of severely compromised sperm motility (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and RABL2 variants have been implicated in infertility in men (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jamsai <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>); 3) RABL2 was reported to interact with the +TIP protein EB1 and some components of the IFT-B complex (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>); 4) the results of a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rual <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) suggested a potential RABL2-interacting protein, C3ORF34, which was shown to localize to the centrosome and was therefore renamed as centrosomal protein of 19 kDa (CEP19; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jakobsen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>); and finally, 5) after we started this study, CEP19 deficiency in humans and mice was reported to cause sperm defects and morbid obesity (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shalata <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), both of which are typical symptoms of ciliopathies (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Witman, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that RABL2 and CEP19 indeed interact with each other and colocalize to the mother centriole and the basal body. In addition, we show that CEP19 recruits RABL2 to the centriole and that CEP19 is recruited to the centrosome via its interaction with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 oncogene partner (FGFR1OP, also known as FOP), which is another centrosomal protein. We then find that a mutant of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> with a disrupted <italic>RABL2</italic> gene lacks flagella. Furthermore, we show that RABL2, in its GTP-bound state, can interact with the IFT-B complex via the IFT74âIFT81 dimer and that the interaction is abolished by the point mutation found in <italic>Mot</italic> mice. Furthermore, the exogenous expression of a GDP-bound or <italic>Mot</italic>-type RABL2 mutant significantly inhibits ciliogenesis. On the basis of these data, we propose that RABL2 localizes to the mother centriole/basal body, where it plays a crucial role in ciliary assembly by regulating IFT-B function in some way.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CEP19 binds to RABL2 via its C-terminal region</title><p>RABL2 is highly conserved in ciliated organisms, including humans, mice, zebrafish, and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">EliÃ¡Å¡ <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; Supplemental Figure S1A); humans have two virtually identical paralogues (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kramer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">EliÃ¡Å¡ <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), RABL2A and RABL2B (97% identity at the amino acid level), whereas mice have a single <italic>RABL2</italic> gene. However, the <italic>RABL2</italic> gene is not found in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> or <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">EliÃ¡Å¡ <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>CEP19</italic> gene is conserved in humans, mice, zebrafish, and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (Supplemental Figure S1B) but is not found in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic>; note that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> sequences deposited as two separate genes (XM_001690851 and XM_001690852) actually constitute a single <italic>CEP19</italic> gene and that the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> protein predicted from the cDNA cloned by reverse transcription (RT)âPCR using a set of primers for the 5â²- and 3â²-terminal sequences of XM_001690851 and XM_001690852, respectively (Supplemental Table S3), has a large insertion in the middle region relative to the CEP19 protein of other species (Supplemental Figure S1B). Thus conservation of the <italic>RABL2</italic> and <italic>CEP19</italic> genes during evolution appears to have occurred in parallel.</p><p>Although the database of a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis suggested that RABL2 can interact with CEP19 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rual <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), two-hybrid analyses often yield false-positive results. To verify the potential interaction between RABL2 and CEP19, we transiently coexpressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)âCEP19 and RABL2B-HA in HEK293T cells and subjected lysates prepared from the cells to immunoprecipitation with a glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-tagged anti-GFP nanobody (Nb); note that we used human RABL2B in this study because only RABL2B cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification of a human testis cDNA library using a set of primers with sequences common to both the <italic>RABL2A</italic> and <italic>RABL2B</italic> genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, wild-type (WT) RABL2B-HA was coimmunoprecipitated with EGFP-CEP19 (lane 5). Because RABL2 has GTP-binding motifs that are conserved among the small GTPases, we then constructed RABL2B mutants according to previous studies for other GTPases: the Q80L mutant, which is predicted to be locked in a GTP-bound state, and the S35N mutant, which is predicted to be a GDP-bound form. We also constructed the RABL2B(D73G) mutant because a corresponding mutation in male mice (<italic>Mot</italic> mice) was reported to cause infertility (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). When we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using these RABL2 mutants, we found RABL2B(Q80L) to interact with CEP19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 7), similarly to RABL2B(WT) (lane 5), whereas RABL2B(S35N) did not interact with CEP19 (lane 6), indicating that RABL2 binds to CEP19 in its GTP-bound state. On the other hand, RABL2B(D73G) interacted with CEP19 (lane 8). These results indicate that the phenotype of male sterility in <italic>Mot</italic> mice is not caused by the inability of RABL2 to interact with CEP19.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Interaction between RABL2 and CEP19. (A) Interaction of RABL2 with CEP19. HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with expression vectors for EGFP-CEP19 and RABL2B(WT)-HA or its mutant (S35N, Q80L, or D73G). At 24 h after the transfection, lysates were prepared from the transfected cells and immunoprecipitated with GST-fused antiâGFP Nb prebound to glutathioneâSepharose 4B beads. Proteins bound to the precipitated beads were subjected to SDSâPAGE and immunoblotting analysis using anti-HA or anti-GFP antibodies.

To this end, we constructed various deletion mutants of CEP19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and coexpressed them with RABL2B, followed by the coimmunoprecipitation assay as described earlier. Truncation of up to the first N-terminal 30 amino acids of CEP19 did not affect its ability to bind to RABL2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2). When 17 amino acids were truncated from the C-terminus, the construct, CEP19(1-150), retained the ability to interact with RABL2B (lane 5). In considerable contrast, C-terminal truncation of 47 amino acid residues from the C-terminus, CEP19(1-120), abolished the RABL2B-binding ability of CEP19 (lane 6).

However, if CEP19 functions upstream of RABL2, the observation that ciliogenesis of <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO RPE1 cells, although significantly decreased, was not completely abolished cannot be readily explained. We therefore addressed another possibilityâthat, via interacting with some downstream effector(s), RABL2 is in some way involved in the trafficking of flagellar/ciliary proteins, including the Î±Î²-tubulin dimer, which is the building block of the flagellar/ciliary axoneme. One candidate downstream effector of RABL2 is the IFT-B complex, as it mediates intraciliary/intraflagellar trafficking of tubulins (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhogaraju <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and a previous study suggested that RABL2 interacts, directly or indirectly, with the IFT-B complex (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether the IFT-B complex can interact directly with RABL2, we took advantage of the <underline>v</underline>isible <underline>i</underline>mmuno<underline>p</underline>recipitation (VIP) assay, which we recently developed to enable the convenient and flexible detection of proteinâprotein interactions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Katoh <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).

When cells coexpressing mChe/tRFP-tagged core or peripheral subunits and RABL2B(Q80L)-EGFP were processed for the VIP assay, we observed red signals only when the mChe/tRFP-tagged core subunits were coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). When the core subunits were divided into two subgroups, IFT22/IFT25/IFT27/IFT74/IFT81 (core 1) and IFT46/IFT52/IFT56/IFT70/IFT88 (core 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8L</xref>), only the core 1 subgroup resulted in intense red signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). We then performed the subtractive VIP assay to determine the core 1 subunit(s) responsible for the RABL2 interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>, red signals were greatly reduced when mChe-tagged IFT74 or IFT81 was omitted, suggesting that these two subunits are directly involved in the RABL2 interaction. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of RABL2B(Q80L)-EGFP resulted in red signals upon coexpression with mChe-tagged IFT74+IFT81 but not with IFT74 or IFT81 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>), indicating that RABL2 interacts with a complex of IFT74 and IFT81, which are known to form a tight heterodimer through their coiled-coil regions, and directly interacts with tubulins (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhogaraju <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We next analyzed the interaction of wild-type RABL2 and its mutants with the IFT74âIFT81 dimer by the VIP assay. As was the case for all the IFT-B subunits fused to mChe, mChe-tagged IFT74+IFT81 interacted robustly with RABL2B(Q80L)-EGFP. In addition, mChe-IFT74+IFT81 demonstrated a weak interaction with RABL2B(WT)-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). By contrast, RABL2B(S35N)-EGFP did not result in red signals when it was coexpressed with mChe-IFT74+IFT81. Furthermore, virtually no red signals were detected when the <italic>Mot</italic>-type mutant RABL2B(D73G) was coexpressed with mChe-IFT74+IFT81. We then confirmed the VIP data by conventional immunoblotting analysis. RABL2B(Q80L)-EGFP coimmunoprecipitated mChe-tagged IFT74+IFT81 but not IFT74 or IFT81 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>), and RABL2B(WT), but not RABL2B(S35N) or RABL2B(D73G), interacted weakly with mChe-IFT74+IFT81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p><p>We then examined whether RABL2 can simultaneously interact with CEP19 and IFT74âIFT81. To this end, we coexpressed EGFP-tagged IFT74+IFT81 and RABL2B(Q80L)-mChe in the presence or absence of mChe-CEP19 and subjected the cell lysates to the VIP assay using GSTâanti-GFP Nb. Red signals were detected when EGFP-IFT74+IFT81 and RABL2B(Q80L)-mChe were coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8H</xref>, left). Intriguingly, the red signals were abolished when mChe-CEP19 was additionally coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8H</xref>, right). The VIP data were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. RABL2B(Q80L)-mChe was coimmunoprecipitated with EGFP-IFT74+IFT81 in the absence but not in the presence of coexpressed mChe-CEP19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8I</xref>). Reciprocally, when RABL2B(Q80L)-EGFP was coexpressed with mChe-IFT74+IFT81 in the presence or absence of EGFP-CEP19, the amount of coimmunoprecipitated mChe-IFT74+IFT81 was greatly decreased by the coexpression of EGFP-CEP19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8, J and K</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that RABL2 is likely to interact, probably in its GTP-bound state, with CEP19 and the IFT-B complex in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8L</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Participation of RABL2 in ciliary assembly</title><p>The interaction data, together with the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutant phenotype, suggest two possible roles of RABL2 in ciliary function. One possibility is that, although RABL2 is localized mainly at the ciliary base in the steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), it is trafficked anterogradely as a cargo of the IFT-B complex during ciliogenesis. The other possibility is that RABL2 in some way regulates the IFT-B complex at the ciliary base. To address the first possibility, we used our recently established <italic>IFT139</italic>-KO RPE1 cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In the absence of IFT139 (an IFT-A subunit), anterograde ciliary trafficking mediated by the IFT-B complex still occurs, whereas retrograde trafficking mediated by the IFT-A complex is suppressed, resulting in accumulation of the IFT-B complex at the bulged ciliary tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9, Bâ² and Câ²</xref>). Therefore this phenotype can be used to determine whether RABL2 is a cargo of the IFT-B complex. In the two independent <italic>IFT139</italic>-KO cell lines (139-2-6 and 139-2-8), RABL2 and CEP19 were found at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9, B and C, and E and F</xref>, respectively) as in control RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9, A and D</xref>), and neither of the proteins was colocalized with IFT88 (an IFT-B subunit) at the bulged tips. These observations suggest that RABL2 is not a cargo of the IFT-B complex, although it remains possible that RABL2 was once trafficked with the IFT train and then returned to the ciliary base by diffusion after dissociation from the IFT-B complex at the ciliary tips.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9:</label><caption><p> RABL2 participates in ciliary assembly.

In view of the fact that CEP19 determines the localization of RABL2 at the ciliary base, we examined localization of IFT88 in <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO cell lines. In the majority of control RPE1 cells, IFT88 is found within cilia as well as at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5O</xref>). In the <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO cell lines, however, the population of cells with IFT88 signals only at the ciliary base (namely, those without IFT88 signals within cilia) was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, K and L</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5O</xref>), although the cellular level of the IFT88 protein was not substantially changed in the absence of CEP19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>, middle). These observations indirectly suggest that RABL2 somehow participates in recruitment of the IFT-B complex to the ciliary base and/or its entry into cilia (see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p><p>We then anticipated that overexpression of RABL2B(S35N) or RABL2B(D73G) might have a dominant-negative effect on the assembly of cilia through affecting IFT-B function, because these mutants failed to interact with the IFT-B complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8, F and G</xref>). Indeed, when expressed in hTERT-RPE1 cells, both RABL2B(S35N)-EGFP and RABL2B(D73G)-EGFP significantly suppressed ciliogenesis, as depicted by the staining for Ac-Î±-tubulin, compared with exogenously expressed EGFP or RABL2B(WT)-EGFP (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9, IâIâ²â² and KâKâ²â²</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">GâGâ²â² and HâHâ²â²</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9L</xref>). Taken together with the phenotype of the <italic>Chlamydomonas rabl2</italic> strain, it is likely that RABL2 is involved in ciliary assembly by regulating IFT-B function, which mediates the trafficking of tubulins and other ciliary proteins (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhogaraju <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that RABL2 is recruited to the mother centriole/basal body via its interaction with CEP19, which is probably recruited to the centriole via its interaction with FGFR1OP. Of interest, endogenous RABL2 and CEP19 are localized on the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, DâF</xref>), whereas FGFR1OP is found on both centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, EâEâ²â²â²</xref>). These observations suggest that, besides FGFR1OP binding, other factor(s) on the mother centriole determine the localization of CEP19. In this context, it is noteworthy that exogenously expressed CEP19 localized to both centrioles (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>). Therefore it is also possible that some factor located at the daughter centriole restricts the access of CEP19 to FGFR1OP and that overexpressed CEP19 might titrate out the restricting factor.</p><p>
<italic>CEP19</italic>-KO RPE1 cells lacked the centrosomal localization of RABL2 as well as exhibited mild ciliogenesis defects. On the other hand, the available <italic>Chlamydomonas rabl2</italic> strain cannot form flagella. These results make it likely that the assembly of flagella in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> requires the interaction of RABL2 with proteins other than CEP19. We then unequivocally demonstrated that RABL2 interacts with the IFT-B complex via the IFT74âIFT81 heterodimer; the RABL2âIFT-B interaction was suggested by a previous study (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that RABL2 binding to IFT-B is mutually exclusive with that to CEP19. Although the IFT-B complex is involved in the anterograde trafficking of ciliary proteins (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sung and Leroux, 2013</xref>), our data using <italic>IFT139</italic>-KO and <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO cells suggest that RABL2 is unlikely to be trafficked as a cargo of IFT-B but might participate, directly or indirectly, in ciliary entry of the IFT-B complex at the ciliary base. In this context, it is noteworthy that the distribution patterns of IFT88 revealed by superresolution microscopy suggested accumulation of IFT particles at the ciliary base before entering cilia (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that RABL2 regulates recruitment or assembly of the IFT-B complex at the ciliary base.</p><p>The interactions of the three RAB-like GTPases (RABL2, RABL4/IFT27/BBS19, and RABL5/IFT22) with the same IFT74âIFT81 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8L</xref>) suggest pivotal roles of the heterodimer in the IFT-B complex. Indeed, in the architecture model we proposed of the IFT-B complex (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Katoh <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) as well as in that proposed by others (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Taschner <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), the IFT74âIFT81 heterodimer is responsible for the interactions with IFT22, the IFT25âIFT27 dimer, and the IFT46âIFT52 dimer. In addition and of greater importance, via their N-terminal regions, the IFT74âIFT81 dimer binds to and mediates trafficking of the Î±Î²-tubulin dimer, which is the building block of the ciliary axoneme (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhogaraju <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>); this is compatible with the phenotype of the <italic>Chlamydomonas rabl2</italic> strain and that of RPE1 cells with exogenous expression of the RABL2 mutants.</p><p>In this context, it is interesting to note that the IFT74âIFT81 dimer interacts more strongly with RABL2B(Q80L) than with RABL2B(WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8, F and G</xref>), whereas CEP19 binds to RABL2B(WT) and RABL2B(Q80L) with similar affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is also noteworthy that the interactions of RABL2 with IFT-B and CEP19 are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8, HâK</xref>), whereas the RABL2âCEP19âFGFR1OP ternary complex can be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). A possible scenario is that 1) RABL2 localizes to the basal body/mother centriole via its constitutive interaction with CEP19, and 2) on its activation, RABL2 becomes able to interact with and somehow regulates the IFT-B complex, such as its recruitment to the ciliary base and its ciliary entry. To address this possibility, it is therefore an important issue to identify a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RABL2.</p><p>
<italic>Mot</italic> mice with a point mutation in the <italic>RABL2</italic> gene (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), as well as <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO mice (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shalata <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), exhibit male sterility caused by a motility dysfunction of their sperm. However, in these mice, the formation of cilia and flagella does not appear to be severely affected. Our data showing that <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO RPE1 cell lines exhibit a mild defect in the formation of cilia are compatible with the phenotype of <italic>CEP19</italic>-KO mice. By contrast, the <italic>Chlamydomonas rabl2</italic> strain lacks flagella. While this article was under review, male infertile patients with short sperm flagella were reported to have a splicing-site mutation in the <italic>RABL2B</italic> gene (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hosseini <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Therefore the differences in the phenotype between sperm flagella of <italic>Mot</italic> mice, flagella of the <italic>Chlamydomonas rabl2</italic> strain, and sperm flagella of infertile men may be attributed to differences between the effects of a point mutation (D73G) and the disruption of the <italic>RABL2</italic> gene. Intriguingly, the D73G mutation abolishes or greatly decreases the interaction of RABL2 with the IFT-B complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8, F and G</xref>). In marked contrast, the <italic>Mot</italic>-type mutation does not affect the RABL2âCEP19 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that the phenotype of <italic>Mot</italic> mice is not due to a change in the interaction of RABL2 with CEP19. In view of the fact that <italic>Mot</italic> mice demonstrate a defect in sperm motility but not in the assembly of sperm flagella, at least at the light microscopic level (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), it is possible that the D73G mutation affects the trafficking of proteins other than tubulins. For example, motile cilia diseases are often caused by mutations in the genes of components of the outer dynein arm, inner dynein arm, and radial spoke (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Praveen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), some of which were reported to bind to the IFT-B complex (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Huttlin <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).
