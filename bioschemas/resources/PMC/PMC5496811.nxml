        <p id="P1">Cadherins mediate diverse processes critical in inflammation including cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Herein, we report that the uncharacterized cadherin 26 (CDH26) is highly expressed by epithelial cells in human allergic gastrointestinal tissue. <italic>In vitro</italic>, CDH26 promotes calcium-dependent cellular adhesion of cells lacking endogenous cadherins by a mechanism involving homotypic binding and interaction with catenin family members (alpha, beta, and p120), as assessed by biochemical assays. Additionally, CDH26 enhances cellular adhesion to recombinant integrin Î±4Î²7 <italic>in vitro</italic>; conversely, recombinant CDH26 binds Î±E and Î±4 integrins in biochemical and cellular functional assays, respectively. Interestingly, CDH26-Fc inhibits activation of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> including secretion of IL-2. Taken together, we have identified a novel functional cadherin regulated during allergic responses with unique immunomodulatory properties, as it binds Î±4 and Î±E integrins and regulates leukocyte adhesion and activation, and may thus represent a novel checkpoint for immune regulation and therapy via CDH26-Fc.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Cadherins, a family of transmembrane cell surface glycoproteins, mediate calcium-dependent cell adhesion and exhibit a tightly regulated tissue-specific expression pattern. Cadherins expressed predominantly within epithelia such as E-cadherin (CDH1) and P-cadherin (CDH3)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> contribute to the maintenance of skin and mucosal barriers, regulating access of pathogens and allergens to underlying tissue and immunocytes. Modulation of cadherin expression and function has been associated with a number of diseases such as cancer, in which metastatic tumorigenesis is often associated with a switch in cadherin expression such as CDH1 to CDH2 (N-cadherin)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, as well as diverse inflammatory diseases, including but not limited to asthma, eczema, chronic rhinosinusitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Focusing on epithelial CDHs, reduced CDH1 occurs in gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and eczema and has been shown to contribute to loss of epithelial integrity, impairment of barrier function, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. A substantial advance in the cadherin field has been the finding that CDH1 binds lymphocyte integrin Î±EÎ²7 and regulates the activation and localization of epidermal and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Despite these observations regarding CDH1, the involvement of other cadherins in the regulation of immunologic processes mediated by the mucosal epithelium such as their binding to integrins has not been described.</p>
      <p id="P3">Allergic disorders are characterized by a Th2 immune response that involves the accumulation of distinct subsets of activated leukocytes at the affected site. In particular, in addition to eosinophils, increased numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells have been observed at sites of allergic gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, highly elevated levels of Th2 cytokines, including IL-13, suggest activation of these cells at sites of allergic GI inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In general, it is known that leukocytes, in part under the influence of soluble mediators including cytokines and chemokines, localize from the blood to tissue in a multi-step process involving the coordinate expression and activation of leukocyte-expressed selectins and integrins and their counter-receptors on activated endothelium<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, less is known about how leukocyte-expressed receptors interact with epithelial ligands to influence cellular localization and activation, particularly in the context of allergic inflammation.</p>
      <p id="P4">We identified a previously uncharacterized cadherin-like molecule, CDH26, that was markedly overexpressed in human gastrointestinal tissue with active eosinophilic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, yet no studies of this molecule have been reported, although its transcript appears to be upregulated in epithelial cells under Th2-associated conditions<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Herein, we demonstrate that CDH26 is a unique functional cadherin, in that it (1) has an epithelial cell-restricted expression pattern that is particularly prominent following gene induction during allergic inflammation; (2) is an Î±4 and Î±E integrin receptor; (3) has the capacity to modulate leukocyte adhesion and activation; and (4) has immunomodulatory function that can be exploited via a CDH26-Fc fusion protein, which has immunosuppressive activity.</p>

        <title>CDH26 is overexpressed during pathologic allergic inflammation</title>
        <p id="P5">Gastric tissue of control patients and patients with an allergic gastroenteropathy, eosinophilic gastritis (EG), was subjected to global transcript analysis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Additional information about these patients can be found in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. We identified that the most upregulated transcript that passed the criteria <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 2-fold filter was the uncharacterized cadherin family member cadherin 26 (<italic>CDH26</italic>) (12.3-fold<italic>, P</italic> &lt; 0.005)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We verified by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis that the <italic>CDH26</italic> mRNA level was highly increased in the gastric tissue of EG patients within the same cohort subjected to microarray (15.3-fold, n = 5 EG vs. n = 5 control, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>) as well as in additional EG patient gastric tissue (35.6 fold, n = 10 EG vs. n = 10 control<italic>, P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). Comparison of the genes differentially regulated in EG<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> revealed that <italic>CDH26</italic> was the only cadherin family member that exhibited a significant change in gene expression in both allergic disorders. Indeed, as previously observed<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, <italic>CDH26</italic> mRNA expression was significantly increased (115 fold) in the esophageal tissue of patients with active EoE compared to control patients (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Only <italic>CDH1</italic> (E-cadherin) and <italic>CDH26</italic> exhibited raw signals indicative of the transcripts being substantially expressed (i.e. at least one sample for that probe exhibited raw signal â¥ 400) in the gastric tissue of patients with active EG (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Raw signals for cadherin transcripts in esophageal tissue from EoE patients only showed such values for <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CDH3</italic> (P-cadherin), and <italic>CDH26</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). As a control, no significant change in <italic>CDH26</italic> or <italic>CCL26</italic> (eotaxin-3) expression was observed in gastric tissue of patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastritis compared to control patients, although as a control <italic>C3</italic> transcript was elevated in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> cohort as previously reported (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref> and <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>). Notably, a microarray study of gastric antrum tissue of patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> gastritis did not identify <italic>CDH26</italic> as being upregulated compared to normal tissue<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. As such, <italic>CDH26</italic> is a unique cadherin in terms of its expression level and regulation in two distinct allergic states.</p>

        <title>CDH26 protein expression is increased in inflamed allergic gastrointestinal tissue and is localized to epithelial cells</title>
        <p id="P6">Immunohistochemical staining for CDH26 showed localization nearly exclusively in the surface and gland epithelial cells in gastric tissue of patients with EG (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a and b</xref>). The mean peak number of CDH26-positive cells was 241 cells/400X high-power field (HPF) (mean Â± SEM, 104.2 Â± 40.8; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0476, Mann Whitney test) in EG patients compared with no expression above background in controls. Western blot revealed an increased level of gastric CDH26 (4.9 fold) in EG patients compared to control samples (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Patients with active EoE had high levels of esophageal CDH26 protein expression compared to control patients. In control esophageal biopsies, the staining was confined to epithelial cells near the surface, but in active EoE the staining was both more intense and prevalent and included both surface epithelial cells as well as epithelial cells in the expanded basal layer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). By western blot analysis, esophageal tissue of EoE patients showed 3.4-fold increased CDH26 protein levels compared to control tissue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>).</p>
        <sec id="S5">
          <title>CDH26 is a functional cadherin</title>
          <p id="P7">CDH26 exhibits sequence homology to the cadherin family of proteins, with five extracellular cadherin repeats (EC)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> in the putative extracellular portion of the protein, a predicted transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic region (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). To determine if CDH26 localized to the cell membrane of esophageal epithelial cells, affinity isolation of biotinylated surface proteins was performed. Proteins present on the surface of cells were labeled with biotin, the cells were lysed and proteins solubilized, and biotinylated proteins were subjected to affinity isolation using streptavidin beads. Proteins bound to the streptavidin beads were subsequently solubilized in loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot for CDH26 indicated that it was present at the cell surface in esophageal epithelial cells that express high levels of CDH26 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), because it was pulled down only from cells overexpessing CDH26 that underwent surface biotinylation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, lane 8).</p>
          <p id="P8">CDH26 contains five asparagine residues in its extracellular domain located within the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation (N81, N85, N171, N177, N462). To test whether CDH26 is modified by N-linked glycosylation, CDH26 was immunoprecipitated and then treated with peptide: <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F (PNGase F) that was either active or heat-inactivated as a negative control. The treated, immunoprecipitated proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis for CDH26. Immunoprecipitated CDH26 treated with peptide: <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, lane 5), but not heat-inactivated PNGase F (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, lane 6), exhibited increased mobility compared to CDH26 from total cell lysates, indicating that the protein is modified by N-linked glycosylation under baseline conditions.</p>

There are a number of proteins known to bind integrins, including CDH1 as well as ICAM-1, MAdCAM-1, and fibronectin, for which 3D structures have been resolved and integrin binding sites have been localized<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. To map these sites to CDH26, we generated a 3D model of CDH26 structure using homology modeling with the CDH1 structure (PDB ID 3Q2V) as a primary template. The pairwise structure alignment of the model (blue) with other resolved structures (gray) indicates putative integrin binding sites in CDH26 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). As can be seen, known integrin binding sites are located in unstructured loops of the extracellular domain and are negatively charged. D42 of MAdCAM-1 and E34 of ICAM-1 overlap with D98, E99, and E102 in CDH26. D1495 of fibronectin corresponds to E138 of CDH26. The presence of these negatively charged residues in unstructured loops on the surface suggests that CDH26 would bind integrins.</p>
          <p id="P15">We tested whether L929 cells expressing high levels of CDH26 exhibited adhesion to Î±4Î²7 compared to control cells. Indeed, L929 cells transduced with a CDH26 expression vector showed increased adhesion to Î±4Î²7-coated wells compared to control cells, in contrast to BSA-coated wells, which did not support adhesion of either cell type (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Visualization of cellular binding revealed a marked increase of CDH26-expressing cells binding Î±4Î²7 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). To further prove that CDH26 could directly bind Î±4Î²7, a solid phase adhesion assay was performed in which recombinant CDH26-hIgG1-Fc (referred to as CDH26-Fc hereafter; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details of isolation) was added to wells that were coated with recombinant Î±4Î²7.

          <p id="P16">To further substantiate and address the specificity and molecular requirements for CDH26/Î±4Î²7 interaction, overexpression and co-immunoprecipitation studies were carried out using HEK 293T cells.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P19">Herein we have elucidated the properties of CDH26, identifying it as a functional cadherin with unique features in that it is the only cadherin family member significantly upregulated in human allergic gastrointestinal tissue, where it localizes to epithelial cells in the inflamed esophagus and stomach. CDH26 mediates calcium-dependent cell adhesion, dimerizes/multimerizes, and interacts with alpha-, beta-, and p120-catenins. CDH26 also has the ability to impact leukocyte migration and adhesion. Moreover, we present biochemical, molecular, and functional evidence that CDH26-integrin interactions impact cellular adhesion; specifically, integrins Î±4 and Î±E co-immunoprecipitate with CDH26, recombinant CDH26-Fc binds recombinant Î±4Î²7, CDH26-expressing cells adhere to integrin Î±4Î²7, and Jurkat cells adhere to recombinant CDH26-Fc in a manner dependent on integrin Î±4 (see <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for summary and comparison to CDH1). Besides uncovering a novel role for this molecule, we present evidence that it can be exploited to generate a potential therapeutic as CDH26-Fc is an immunosuppressive molecule, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. Taken together, we have identified a novel functional cadherin regulated during allergic inflammation and determined that it binds Î± integrins and has immunomodulatory properties.</p>
      <p id="P20">Given our observation that CDH26 interacts with not only integrin Î±4 but also integrin Î±E, CDH26 might have a function similar to E-cadherin to regulate localization or activation of leukocytes during allergic responses via interacting with leukocyte integrins. Epithelial CDH26 may impact the localization or activation status of diverse Î±4<sup>+</sup> and/or Î±E<sup>+</sup> cells (e.g. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, eosinophils, mast cells) within the epithelium in the context of allergic inflammation. In particular, these subsets of cells are known to be increased in the esophageal epithelium of EoE patients compared to control patients<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>; furthermore, numerous intraepithelial eosinophils are observed in EoE and EG but not in normal esophageal or gastric tissue. This altered intraepithelial localization of several subsets of cells correlates with the fact that CDH26 appears to be a highly inducible molecule in epithelial cells that is present at only low levels under homeostatic conditions.</p>
      <p id="P21">We identified several lines of evidence that CDH26 interacts with alpha integrins and facilitates cellular binding to Î±4-containing integrins, including both integrin Î±4Î²7 and Î±4Î²1. Biochemical assays suggested that the extracellular portion of CDH26 could directly bind the Î±4-containing integrin Î±4Î²7. Furthermore, we observed that cells expressing high levels of CDH26 adhered to recombinant integrin, and in the reciprocal situation, recombinant CDH26 was sufficient to mediate adhesion of Jurkat T cells in a manner dependent on integrin Î±4. Such interactions are consistent with the structural properties of CDH26, which include the presence of solvent-exposed acidic residues that could be critical to facilitate the CDH26/integrin interaction. We speculate that in addition to mediating adhesion, interaction of epithelial-expressed CDH26 with leukocyte integrins could initiate intracellular signaling in both epithelial cells and leukocytes. This could impact diverse processes such as alteration of gene expression, regulation of barrier function, or production of mediators by either cell type.</p>
      <p id="P22">It has been shown that integrin Î±4 ligands including fibronectin, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1 costimulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by suboptimal TCR activation<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>â<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Our data show that CDH26-Fc inhibited CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation mediated by suboptimal TCR engagement. We additionally observed that CDH1-Fc had similar effects. In fact, although CDH1 has previously been shown to co-stimulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, it has additionally been shown to be an inhibitory molecule in several settings; for example, ligation of E-cadherin expressed by dendritic epidermal T cells with CDH1 expressed by epidermal keratinocytes inhibits DETC IFN-Î³ production, TNF-Î± production, and degranulation in response to TCR stimulation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, CDH1 has been shown to be a counterreceptor for killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), which is expressed by NK cells, memory T cells, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Engagement of KLRG1 by E-cadherin promotes inhibitory effects in the KLRG1-expressing cell including inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity, inhibition of antigen-induced proliferation and induction of cytolytic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and inhibition of type 2 cytokine production of type 2 innate lymphoid cells<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>â<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. We speculate that CDH26 may act as a counterregulatory molecule either through engagement of integrins or other unknown counterreceptors to dampen the Th2-associated inflammatory responses. Although molecules upregulated during disease might be assumed to be involved in promoting disease, upregulation of CDH26 could be part of the mechanism by which resolution of inflammation occurs to promote the return of the tissue to homeostasis. Alternatively, it is possible that CDH26 engagement may inhibit particular subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; for example, regulatory T cells, which are known to be increased in EoE and EG<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, or other more select CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets such as Th1 or Th2 cells. Depending on the subset of T cells inhibited, the molecule could serve either to dampen or accelerate Th2-associated inflammatory responses. In summary, CDH26 is now the second cadherin (besides CDH1) that has been shown to bind Î±-integrins, extending the paradigm of cadherin/integrin interactions and leading to the unexpected finding that CDH26-Fc (as well as CDH1-Fc) has T cell immunosuppressive activity, providing a potential novel therapeutic strategy.</p>

For each cell type, 50,000 cells were added per well. The plate was spun at 10 Ã g for 1 min and subsequently incubated at 37Â°C for 1 h. Wells were washed by gravity one time by inverting the plate in a large beaker of assay buffer for 10 min. Two additional washes were performed by pipetting 100 Î¼l of assay buffer into the wells 4 times per wash. Fluorescence was measured prior to the washes and after each wash using a plate reader (ex/em 485/20 nm/528/20 nm) (BioTek). The results are expressed as the percent fluorescence remaining (fluorescence after the last wash/initial fluorescence) for each well.</p>

        <p>Model of CDH26 expression and function in allergic inflammation. CDH26 is expressed by GI epithelial cells in allergic GI inflammatory conditions. CDH26 dimerizes, interacts with beta-, alpha-, and p120-catenins, and mediates calcium-dependent cell adhesion. CDH26 additionally interacts with integrin Î±4 (ITGA4) and integrin Î±E (ITGAE), which may impact leukocyte migration, localization, or activation status in allergic tissue.</p>
