        <p>Xu et al. show that LRCH1 interferes with the GEF activity of DOCK8 to inhibit Cdc42 activation. Upon chemokine stimulation, DOCK8 is phosphorylated and released from LRCH1 to drive cell migration. LRCH1 overexpression reduces CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell migration to the CNS and ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Directional autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell migration into the central nervous system plays a critical role in multiple sclerosis. Recently, DOCK8 was identified as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42 activation and has been associated with human mental retardation. Little is known about whether DOCK8 is related to multiple sclerosis (MS) and how to restrict its GEF activity. Using two screening systems, we found that LRCH1 competes with Cdc42 for interaction with DOCK8 and restrains T cell migration. In response to chemokine stimulation, PKCÎ± phosphorylates DOCK8 at its three serine sites, promoting DOCK8 separation from LRCH1 and translocation to the leading edge to guide T cell migration. Point mutations at the DOCK8 serine sites block chemokine- and PKCÎ±-induced T cell migration. Importantly, <italic>Dock8</italic> mutant mice or <italic>Lrch1</italic> transgenic mice were protected from MOG (35â55) peptideâinduced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), whereas <italic>Lrch1</italic>-deficient mice displayed a more severe phenotype. Notably, DOCK8 expression was markedly increased in PBMCs from the acute phase of MS patients. Together, our study demonstrates LRCH1 as a novel effector to restrain PKCÎ±âDOCK8âCdc42 moduleâinduced T cell migration and ameliorate EAE.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a T cellâmediated inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS with a complex genetic background (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">McFarland and Martin, 2007</xref>). Autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte extravasation and infiltration into the CNS is a finely regulated cascade of steps that is controlled by integrins, chemokines, or inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sigal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Vajkoczy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kerfoot and Kubes, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ransohoff et al., 2003</xref>). Chemokines such as SDF-1Î± (also termed CXCL12) and CCL5 are increased in MS lesions, which attract T lymphocytes across the endothelial cell monolayer (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¸rensen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">dos Santos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krumbholz et al., 2006</xref>). Data from human MS genomeâwide association studies and murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models suggest that the dysregulation of T cell extravasation by key signaling proteins, such as S1P<sub>1</sub> (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), might mediate MS development (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">De Jager et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sawcer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Damotte et al., 2014</xref>). Targeting VCAM-1or S1P<sub>1</sub> by antibodies or small molecules represents a novel approach for treating MS (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Steinman, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chun and Hartung, 2010</xref>). However, given their side effects, it is critical to explore new proteins that restrain T cell infiltration into the CNS and ameliorate MS.</p>
      <p>Cdc42, a member of the Rho small GTPases, orchestrates the cell cytoskeleton for T cell migration. Cdc42 activity is precisely controlled temporally and spatially (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Haddad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>). When responding to chemokines, Cdc42 switches from the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active state in the presence of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Randall et al., 2009</xref>). Several GEFs in T cells, including the VAV and DOCK (dedicator of cytokinesis) family proteins, ensure the proper activation of Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harada et al., 2012</xref>). Studies suggest that Vav1-deficient mice are prevented from EAE induction (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tybulewicz, 2005</xref>), and mice having <italic>Dock8</italic> mutations or the loss of the <italic>Dock8</italic> gene exhibit impaired immune responses to clear viral infection (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Randall et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lambe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jabara et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, human <italic>DOCK8</italic> mutations or SNPs are associated with immunodeficiency and mental retardation (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Griggs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Despite this, it is unknown whether DOCK8 is engaged in MS, and which negative regulators restrict DOCK8 GEF activity to prevent immune cell migration.</p>
      <p>In this study, we identified LRCH1 as a novel binding partner to sequester DOCK8 from Cdc42. Upon chemokine stimulation, DOCK8 is phosphorylated by PKCÎ± to separate from LRCH1 and relocate at the leading edge for T cell migration. By generation of <italic>Lrch1</italic> transgenic, <italic>Lrch1</italic> knockout and <italic>Dock8</italic> mutant mice, we demonstrated their critical role in controlling the development of EAE in vivo.</p>

Some of these signaling proteins, including VAV1, ADAP, SKAP55, Rap1, RapL, Mst1, and DOCK8, also regulate T cell activation, apoptosis, or inflammation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Katagiri et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Rudd, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015a</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>). Considering the central role of myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and infiltration into the CNS in the pathogenesis of MS, we asked whether the expression levels of these molecules were associated with human MS patients. The mRNA levels of Rap1, WASP, VAV1, ADAP, talin, RapL, Mst1, or DOCK8 (but not SKAP55) were significantly enhanced in PBMCs from MS patients compared with age-matched healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). In agreement with our observation, previous studies suggest that a deficiency of VAV1 or ADAP ameliorates myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG 35â55)âinduced EAE, a mouse model that mimics human MS (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Korn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Engelmann et al., 2013</xref>). Because Mst1 binds to the RapLâRap1 complex, whereas DOCK8 is the key downstream effector of Mst1 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mou et al., 2012</xref>), we asked whether DOCK8 influenced the pathogenesis of MS/EAE. First, we confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of DOCK8 were significantly elevated in the PBMCs from MS patients, compared with those from healthy controls and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients who displayed similar symptoms to those of MS, but with a distinct etiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). Furthermore, during the development of murine EAE model, we noticed that more CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells circulated in the blood and infiltrated in the CNS at the peak stage than those at the presyndrome or remission stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Dock8 levels in the blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly increased at the peak stage of EAE compared with at the presymptom or remission stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This suggests that DOCK8 expression levels are correlated with EAE severity.</p>

        <p>Next, we elucidated whether DOCK8 was a susceptible gene for the induction and development of EAE. As previously reported (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Randall et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> mice contain a serine-to-proline substitution in the DHR-2 (DOCK homology region 2) domain of Dock8, which abolishes the GEF activity for Cdc42 activation. In response to immunization with a MOG (35â55) peptide, all of the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic> mice developed EAE, whereas less than half of the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> mice manifested EAE symptoms, which also reduced the disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Consistently, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or luxol fast blue staining revealed a decreased numbers of immune cells and a lower degree of demyelination in the spinal cord sections of the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> mice compared with those of <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Additionally, the percentages of the CNS-infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were remarkably decreased in the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> mice when EAE developed at the peak phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). In contrast, the percentages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or B220<sup>+</sup> B cells were apparently not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because Dock8 regulates naive T cell apoptosis (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harada et al., 2012</xref>), we injected BrdU into the MOG (35â55)âinduced <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> EAE mice 1 d before the lymphocytes were collected to see whether <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed abnormal proliferation or apoptosis in vivo. Compared with the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed both increased proliferation and apoptosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>), resulting in the same percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the draining LNs and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 J</xref>). Moreover, IFN-Î³ and IL-17A production in the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as the percentages of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (T reg) cells in the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic>mice, was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 K</xref>). These results led us to speculate whether Dock8 regulated the induction of EAE mainly via affecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell migration.</p>

        <title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> mice ameliorate EAE with reduced CNS infiltration and migration</title>
        <p>To answer this question, equal numbers of encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were harvested from the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> mice 8 d after MOG (35â55) immunization, and were transferred into the sublethally irradiated WT recipient mice.

More than 60% of the recipient mice developed EAE after being reconstituted with the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/+</sup></italic> encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast, no recipient mice showed the EAE phenotype after being injected with the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), which showed less immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, top) and a lower degree of demyelination in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, we revealed a reduced numbers of the adoptively transferred <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the CNS or blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), which indeed showed impaired migration toward SDF-1Î± or CCL5 in a transwell assay ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>, left). Nevertheless, the <italic>Dock8<sup>pri/pri</sup></italic> encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not affect expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>, right).

        <p>To accomplish directional migration to the sites of inflammation in the CNS, T cells need to polarize and transmigrate through the blood vessels. A polarized migrating T cell displays a typical hand-mirrorâlike morphology with key molecules being redistributed at the front region or the back tail (i.e., CD44 accumulation in the uropod; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ransohoff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Engelhardt and Ransohoff, 2005</xref>). We overexpressed wild-type DOCK8 or the mutant <italic>pri</italic> into the T cell line T8.1 cells. T8.1 cells expressed endogenous DOCK8, and the exogenous wild-type DOCK8 or the mutant <italic>pri</italic> did not affect surface CXCR4 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>, right). In response to SDF-1Î± stimulation, &gt;50% of the DOCK8-expressing T8.1 cells polarized with the DOCK8 translocation at the leading edge and CD44 accumulation in the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>); this was in agreement with the enhanced T cell migration in the transwell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>, left). In contrast, only 30% of the mutant <italic>pri</italic>-expressing T8.1 cells showed CD44 accumulation in the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>), which failed to enhance cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>, left).

        <title>LRCH1 is identified as a new binding partner of DOCK8</title>
        <p>To understand the underline mechanism of DOCK8 function in T cell migration and EAE/MS, we searched DOCK8âs binding partners using mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid assays (see Materials and methods). Immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody was performed and the pull-down proteins at 95 kD were identified by the mass spectrometry analysis from T8.1 cells, which was stably transfected to overexpress FLAG-tagged DOCK8. A specific band at a molecular weight 95 kD was identified as LRCH1 (Leucine-rich repeat [LRR] and calponin homology [CH] domain-containing protein 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, DOCK8 was used as bait for screening a human cDNA library encoding &gt;12,794 human genes (hORFeome V5.1). Positive clones were selected and LRCH1 was again identified in this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Currently, very limited studies have been reported regarding the function of LRCH1. The function of LRCH was initially reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which has only one isoform named dLRCH. dLRCH colocalizes with F-actin and functions as a cytoskeleton regulator (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Foussard et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is still a controversy about whether a C/T transition single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/912428">rs912428</ext-link>) in LRCH1 is a risk factor for human osteoarthritis. We were therefore excited to explore whether and how LRCH1 functioned together with DOCK8 in the regulation of EAE.</p>

        <p>We first verified the interaction between DOCK8 and LRCH1 by immunoprecipitation using 293T cells that were transfected with a FLAG-tagged DOCK8 and an HA-tagged LRCH1. The FLAG-tagged DOCK8 could pull down the HA-tagged LRCH1 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Next, we truncated DOCK8 and LRCH1 to map their binding regions. LRCH1 contains nine leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a single CH domain. We found that the N-terminal fragment containing all nine LRRs (i.e., LRR<sub>1-9</sub> and 1-304aa) bound to DOCK8. In contrast, after losing two LRRs, the first seven LRRs (i.e., LRR<sub>1-7</sub> and 1-238aa) lost this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>), suggesting the importance of the whole nine LRRs for this interaction. Additionally, the fragment containing 305â763 aa of LRCH1 failed to interact with DOCK8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). We further found that the DHR-2 domain (i.e., 1635â2099 aa) of DOCK8 interacted with LRCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>), whereas the deletion of the two Î±-helixes in the DHR-2 domain (i.e., 1687â2099 aa) or the N-terminal fragment (i.e., 1â1634 aa) lost this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). The DHR-2 domain is conserved in the DOCK-C family, which contains DOCK6, DOCK7, and DOCK8. We found that LRCH1 also interacted with the DHR-2 domain of DOCK6 and DOCK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Whether LRCH1 could affect DOCK6- or DOCK7-induced cell function is to be defined. We have elucidated that the DHR-2 domain of DOCK8 interacts with the nine LRRs of LRCH1.</p>

This was in the agreement with a reduced numbers of the <italic>Lrch1</italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> Tg cells in the CNS or in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Importantly, we confirmed that this was not a result of the abnormal proliferation, apoptosis, or numbers of <italic>Lrch1</italic> Tg CD4<sup>+</sup>cells in response to the MOG (35â55) peptide stimulation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>).

The percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells were also normal in <italic>Lrch1</italic> transgenic mice after EAE induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, encephalitogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified from the <italic>Lrch1</italic> transgenic mice when EAE was developed at the peak stage. Compared with the WT controls, encephalitogenic <italic>Lrch1</italic> Tg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells impaired the ex vivo transmigration toward to SDF-1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). Similar to our observation in the T8.1 cell line, encephalitogenic <italic>Lrch1</italic> Tg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not affect the expression levels of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>). These data together suggest that as a new binding partner of DOCK8, LRCH1, might play a distinctive role in T cell migration and the development of EAE.</p>

        <title>LRCH1 attenuates DOCK8-mediated Cdc42 activation for T cell migration</title>
        <p>Considering the opposite role of DOCK8 and LRCH1 in T cell migration without affecting the expression of chemokine receptors, we speculated how LRCH1 and DOCK8 cooperated together in response to chemokine stimulation. As a GEF protein, DOCK8 binds and activates Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harada et al., 2012</xref>). Using previously reported methods, we incubated T8.1 cells with the tetanus toxoid peptide (Ttox) peptide-pulsed APCs (i.e., APCs and L625.7) to form cell conjugates, and noticed that DOCK8 co-localized with Cdc42 at the immunological synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Moreover, we examined Cdc42 activity in WT and <italic>Lrch1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by transfection of a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)âbased biosensor Raichu-Cdc42, which consists of Cdc42, Cdc42-binding domain of PAK1, and a pair of green fluorescent protein mutants to monitor Cdc42 activation in vivo (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2008</xref>)<italic>.</italic> In response to SDF-1Î± treatment, FRET efficiency was increased in <italic>Lrch1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with that in WT cells, which indicates higher Cdc42 activation in <italic>Lrch1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, left). Activated Cdc42-GTP interacts with the downstream effector PAK1, and we next determined how LRCH1 could affect the amount of activated Cdc42-GTP by a GST pull down assay using the GST-fused CRIB domain of PAK1 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Benard et al., 1999</xref>). Overexpression of LRCH1 in T8.1 cells reduced the amount of activated Cdc42-GTP by a GST pull-down assay compared with the control T8.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, right). Collectively, we suggest that LRCH1 functions as a negative regulator of Cdc42 activation. This led us to speculate whether LRCH1 interfered with Cdc42 activation by modulating the GEF activity of DOCK8.</p>

        <p>Previous studies found that activated GEFs preferentially bind to guanine nucleotideâfree forms of GTPases, suggesting that the Cdc42G15A mutant could be used to measure GEF activity (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">GarcÃ­a-Mata et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore overexpressed DOCK8 with or without LRCH1 in the 293T cells and measured the amount of DOCK8 binding to the GST-fused-Cdc42G15A. Interestingly, fewer DOCK8 interacted with Cdc42G15A when LRCH1 was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In addition, we transfected the FLAG-tagged catalytic DHR-2 domain of DOCK8 with or without LRCH1, followed by a GST pull-down assay to measure how LRCH1 affected Cdc42 activation. Although DOCK8 DHR-2 enhanced the amount of GTP-bound-Cdc42, the coexpression of LRCH1 substantially decreased this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). This led us to speculate whether LRCH1 and Cdc42 competed for binding to the DHR-2 domain of DOCK8. Indeed, in the presence of LRCH1, Cdc42 precipitated less DOCK8 DHR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). To further confirm this phenotype, we purified the recombinant proteins His-DHR-2, GST-Cdc42G15A from <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> and the recombinant proteins FLAG-LRR<sub>1-9</sub> or FLAG-L305-763 from 293T cells. The purity and specificity of the purified His-DHR-2 and GST-Cdc42G15A protein from <italic>E. coli</italic> was shown in a Coomassie blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>). When GST-Cdc42G15A formed a complex with His-DHR-2 in vitro, addition of the increasing amount of FLAG-LRR<sub>1-9</sub> could significantly decrease the amount of GST-Cdc42G15A binding to His-DHR-2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref>). As an important negative control, addition of the purified recombinant protein FLAG-L305-763 did not affect the formation of the complex containing GST-Cdc42G15A and His-DHR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 H</xref>). We propose the novel finding that LRCH1 attenuates DOCK8-mediated Cdc42 activation for T cell migration.</p>
        <p>Upon SDF-1Î± stimulation, DOCK8 redistributed from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. In contrast, LRCH1 was still ubiquitous in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 I</xref>). We questioned whether chemokine signaling induced DOCK8 separation from LRCH1. Indeed, SDF-1Î± treatment could increase DOCK8 phosphorylation, and substantially reduced its interaction with LRCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 J</xref>). To further confirm this, we generated a membrane-bound DOCK8 by fusing the CVIM motif to the C terminus of DOCK8. Critically, the membrane-localized CVIM-FLAG-DOCK8 recruited less LRCH1 and exhibited an enhanced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 K</xref>). This suggests that chemokine-induced DOCK8 phosphorylation might release DOCK8 from LRCH1, which is then able to interact with Cdc42 for further activation.</p>

        <title>PKC phosphorylates DOCK8 for separation from LRCH1</title>
        <p>The next critical question was which kinases could phosphorylate DOCK8. We searched the DOCK8 phosphorylation sites in the PhosphoSitePlus database, which provides the possible in vivo phosphorylation sites of proteins from published studies or from high-throughput phosphorylation site discovery programs. The database showed that the C-terminal motif of DOCK8 (i.e., 2077â2087 aa: SQKRDSFHRSS) is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>), and kinases including PKCÎ± and AKT are predicted to phosphorylate this motif by the program group base prediction 3.0. We therefore treated cells with either PKCÎ± or AKT inhibitors, and then pulled down the membrane-bound CVIM-DOCK8 to assess DOCK8 phosphorylation. The PKCÎ± inhibitor substantially reduced DOCK8 phosphorylation levels, whereas the AKT inhibitor showed little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Moreover, the PKCÎ± inhibitor abolished DOCK8-induced cell migration in response to SDF-1Î± stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). This observation is in agreement with previous studies that PKCÎ± is recruited to membrane for cytoskeleton rearrangement and chemokine-induced cell migration (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>).

Compared with the DOCK8-transfected T8.1 cells, the overexpression of 3S/E further enhanced cell migration in response to SDF-1Î± stimulation, whereas 3S/A markedly inhibited this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Consistently, the 3S/A-transfected cells showed reduced GEF activity in the Cdc42G15A pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Moreover, when coexpression of PKCÎ± with DOCK8 further promoted cell migration to SDF-1Î±, the 3S/A mutant failed to synergize with PKCÎ± to increase migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>).

In contrast, the membrane-bound CVIM-3S/A (abolishing DOCK8 phosphorylation) could still recruit more LRCH1 compared with the membrane-bound DOCK8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 I</xref>). Furthermore, given that PMA stimulation triggers PKCÎ± activation, DOCK8 was phosphorylated, which in turn reduced its interaction with LRCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 J</xref>, lane 2 vs. lane 1). In contrast, the 3S/A mutation failed to be phosphorylated by PMA and still bound to LRCH1 at similar levels as that in resting T8.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 J</xref>, lane 4 vs. lane 3).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>DOCK8 was recently identified as a key modulator for immune cell function, including B cell adhesion and integrin activation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jabara et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with this phenotype, Cdc42 was suggested to be DOCK8âs binding partner for cytoskeleton rearrangement and T cell migration. In this study, we identified LRCH1 as a novel DOCK8-interacting protein to restrain the GEF activity of DOCK8, resulting in the inhibition of Cdc42 activation and T cell migration. During the in vivo MOG (35â55) peptide-induced EAE, we observed the protective role of LRCH1 against EAE as a result of a blockage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell migration into the CNS as demonstrated by <italic>Lrch1</italic> transgenic or <italic>Lrch1</italic> KO mice. Importantly, we also elucidated that LRCH1 deficiency did not affect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, apoptosis, activation and production of IL-2. Next, we identified that LRCH1 competes with Cdc42 for binding to the catalytic DHR-2 domain of DOCK8 and restricts the GEF activity of DOCK8. Other members in the DOCK family contain an SH3 domain, which provides a self-inhibition mechanism to restrain their GEF activity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). For example, the SH3 domain in DOCK1 interacts with its own DHR-2 domain and inhibits Rac binding (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Meller et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, DOCK8 has no SH3 domain. Our study suggests a possible mechanism that DOCK8 interacts with LRCH1 to lock DOCK8 at low GEF activity in resting T cells.</p>
      <p>When T cells are stimulated with external signals such as chemokines, PI3K is activated and generates the product PI(3,4,5)P3 on the membrane, which recruits DOCK8 through its DHR-1 domain (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">CÃ´tÃ© et al., 2005</xref>). We observed that DOCK8 was separated from LRCH1 in the cytoplasm, and relocated to the leading edge with Cdc42 after chemokine stimulation. Our findings are in agreement with previous reports that DOCK8 controls Cdc42 activity, specifically on the leading edge of the cell membrane rather than the globally distributed Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harada et al., 2012</xref>). Combining these observations, we propose a model that DOCK8 is located in the cytoplasm and interacts with LRCH1 to block Cdc42 binding in a resting T cell. In response to chemokine stimulation, DOCK8 is separated from LRCH1 and exposes its DHR-2 domain for Cdc42 activation, whereas its DHR-1 domain is recruited by PI(3,4,5)P3 to relocate DOCK8 at the leading edge of a migrating T cell.</p>
      <p>In line with this scenario, we further demonstrated that in response to chemokine stimulation, PKCÎ± phosphorylates DOCK8 at the Ser2077/2082/2087 sites to promote DOCK8 separation from LRCH1. The Ser2077/2082/2087 phosphoswitch in DOCK8 might alter the local electrostatic potential within the binding surface between DOCK8 and LRCH1, which perturbs the intermolecular interaction. Furthermore, we provided evidence that the DOCK8 3S/E mutant, but not the 3S/A mutant, could enhance T cell migration. Other studies have suggested that PKCÎ± increases the integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 activation for platelet adhesion through the PKDâRap1 pathway (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Medeiros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abram and Lowell, 2009</xref>). We found that neither DOCK8 nor LRCH1 interacted with Rap1, and the activated <italic>Lrch1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> platelets displayed normal levels of active Rap1 using a GST-RBD pull-down assay (unpublished data). Our study has therefore provided evidence to suggest DOCK8 as a new substrate of PKCÎ±, which then activates Cdc42 to enhance T cell migration.</p>
      <p>Because DOCK8 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly enhanced in the acute phase of EAE, it is interesting to further explore whether DOCK8 in autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might be used as valuable biomarkers for the assessment of prognosis or drug responses in MS patients. Considering that drugs targeting cell trafficking to the CNS are now applied to treat MS patients, for example IFN-Î²âderived products (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">De Jager and Hafler, 2007</xref>), targeting DOCK8 may offer a new strategy to ameliorate MS. DOCK8 belongs to the DOCK-C family, which contains DOCK6 and DOCK7. The DOCK-C family also contains the DHR-1 domain for membrane binding to PIP3, and the DHR-2 domain for activation of the Rho small GTPases. We found LRCH1 also interacted with the DHR-2 domain of DOCK6 and DOCK7. And overexpression of LRCH1 reduced the amount of activated Cdc42 in T8.1 cells by a GST pull-down assay. Considering that the global Cdc42 activation was intact in <italic>Dock8</italic>-deficient dendritic cells examined by the same method, this might be caused by the different cell types (T cells versus dendritic cells) used to test Cdc42 activation. Also, it is possible that LRCH1 could restrain Cdc42 activation via binding to all the DOCK-C family members, including DOCK6, DOCK7, and DOCK8. This possibility is to be further investigated. However, whether DOCK6 and DOCK7 are involved in the development of MS is not clear. In addition, little data is available about the function of LRCH1 in mammalian cells. There are conflicting reports about whether a C/T transition SNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/912428">rs912428</ext-link>) in LRCH1 is a risk factor for human osteoarthritis (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Snelling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>). Considering that SNP polymorphisms of PKCÎ± have been identified in MS patients, and PKCÎ±-deficient mice are resistant to EAE (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Meisel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Paraboschi et al., 2014</xref>), this makes us even more interesting to further investigate whether SNP polymorphisms in DOCK8 or LRCH1 are associated with MS using a large population of MS samples.</p>
