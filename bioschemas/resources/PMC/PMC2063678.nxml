      <abstract>
        <p>Transcriptional disturbance is implicated in the pathology of polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). However, it is unknown whether transcriptional repression leads to neuronal death or what forms that death might take. We found transcriptional repression-induced atypical death (TRIAD) of neurons to be distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy. The progression of TRIAD was extremely slow in comparison with other types of cell death. Gene expression profiling revealed the reduction of full-length yes-associated protein (YAP), a p73 cofactor to promote apoptosis, as specific to TRIAD. Furthermore, novel neuron-specific YAP isoforms (YAPÎCs) were sustained during TRIAD to suppress neuronal death in a dominant-negative fashion. YAPÎCs and activated p73 were colocalized in the striatal neurons of HD patients and mutant huntingtin (<italic>htt</italic>) transgenic mice. YAPÎCs also markedly attenuated Htt-induced neuronal death in primary neuron and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> models. Collectively, transcriptional repression induces a novel prototype of neuronal death associated with the changes of YAP isoforms and p73, which might be relevant to the HD pathology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the slow exacerbation of symptoms and by gradual progression of brain pathologies. Patients suffer for 5â20 yr from the onset of the disease to the bed-ridden state. Even fast-progressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis takes 2â5 yr to render the patient bed ridden. Regarding the pathology, the total number of neurons and neural networks among them decrease. However, some of the neurons survive for an extensive period of time despite their expression of abnormal structures that are derived principally from the pathogenic disease-causing products. Typically, nigral neurons that express Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, hippocampal neurons that carry paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease, and motor neurons bearing Bunina bodies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can partially survive until the death of the patient. The mutant protein aggregates that characterize many of these diseases are known to trigger multiple cellular responses, including ER stress and mitochondrial abnormality. These stress responses are clearly sufficient to induce apoptosis in nonneuronal cell lines, whereas the brain pathology of patients indicates that neurons survive for a long period before their demise. A lengthy period of cell death is also observed in the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, a major group of neurodegeneration that includes nine disorders (for reviews see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gusella and MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zoghbi and Orr, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bates, 2003</xref>). Again, a fraction of the neurons that possess nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions of mutant polyQ peptides survives even in affected regions of the brain until the time of necropsy. So far, there is no model that fully explains the lengthy period of cell death in neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p>In addition to ER and mitochondrial stresses, transcriptional dysfunction is suggested as a critical pathological component of polyQ diseases (for reviews see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gusella and MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zoghbi and Orr, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bates, 2003</xref>). Translocation of mutant proteins to the nucleus seems essential for neuronal dysfunction or cell death in polyQ diseases (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Klement et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Saudou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Katsuno et al., 2003</xref>). Numerous transcription-related factors, including LANP, PQBP-1, N-CoR, ARA24, p53, mSin3A, ETO/MTG8, P160/GRIP1, A2BP1, TAF<sub>II</sub>130, CA150, CRX, Sp1, CtBP, PML, TAF<sub>II</sub>30, NF-ÎºB, and SC35, are known to interact or colocalize with mutant polyQ disease proteins (for reviews see <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Okazawa, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sugars and Rubinsztein, 2003</xref>). Interaction with polyQ proteins may impair physiological functions of these transcription factors (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Okazawa, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sugars and Rubinsztein, 2003</xref>), and, finally, even the general transcription level could be repressed (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hoshino et al., 2004</xref>). Some of these polyQ pathology-mediating factors bind directly to the core of transcription machinery, RNA polymerase II (Pol II; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Okazawa et al. 2002</xref>). Therefore, one of the paramount issues in the field of polyQ diseases is the relationship between transcriptional dysfunction and neuronal death. However, as yet, the role of transcriptional disruption in neuronal death is unclear, as is the mode of neuronal death when transcription is severely impaired.</p>
      <p>In this study, we found that inhibition of Pol IIâdependent transcription leads neurons to undergo a slowly progressive atypical cell death (transcriptional repression-induced atypical death [TRIAD]) distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy in morphological and biochemical analyses. Transcriptome analysis of TRIAD suggested that yes-associated protein (YAP), a known transcriptional cofactor, might be relevant to the death process. YAP, which was originally found as a binding protein to Src homology domain 3 of the yes proto-oncogene product (for review see <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sudol et al., 1995</xref>), acts as a transcriptional cofactor of p73, mediates the expression of cell deathâpromoting genes, and induces apoptosis (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yagi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Basu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Melino et al., 2004</xref>). We found that in TRIAD, full-length YAP (FL-YAP) is down-regulated, and novel neuron-specific YAPÎC isoforms lacking the cell deathâpromoting activity sustain to protect neurons in a dominant-negative manner. The shift of balance in YAP isoforms seemed to slow down the cell death signaling pathway of p73 activated by Î±-amanitin (AMA), at least partially. We further questioned the relevance of YAP and p73 to Huntington's disease (HD) by using cellular, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and mouse models as well as human brain samples. Our data suggest that these molecules might be involved in neuronal death triggered by mutant Htt, the causative gene product of HD.</p>

        <p>To address the role of transcriptional disruption in neuronal death, we first made multiple short inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) against RNA Pol II to suppress Pol IIâdependent transcription. However, suppression of Pol II was inadequate and reminiscent of recent efforts to suppress basic transcription machinery by similar approaches (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we used a specific inhibitor of Pol II (AMA) whose three-dimensional molecular structure is exactly complementary to the groove of Pol II, through which mRNA is elongated (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bushnell et al. 2002</xref>). Different concentrations of AMA were added to the culture medium of HeLa cells, primary rat embryonic (embryonic day [E] 15) cortical neurons, rat E15 striatal neurons, and rat pup cerebellar neurons (postnatal day [P] 7). BrdU up-take assay (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hoshino et al., 2004</xref>) showed significant repression of transcription at 6 h of AMA treatment in primary neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and HeLa cells (not depicted). The survival of AMA-treated cells estimated by trypan blue assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) revealed that AMA induces a slowly progressive cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. This was most pronounced in primary neurons, with half-lives of nearly 5 d. AMA-induced neuronal death was much slower than low potassiumâinduced apoptosis of cerebellar neurons, whose half-life was â¼12 h (not depicted). The slow progression of AMA-induced neuronal death was confirmed independently by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509132/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509132/DC1</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>A population of HeLa cells (10â30%) began to show cytoplasmic vacuoles proximal to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, HeLa-TRIAD) from 6â12 h after the addition of AMA. Similar vacuoles were also observed in cortical neurons treated with AMA for 2 d (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, CTX neuron-TRIAD), although with a diminished frequency (1â5%). It is important to note that the vacuoles did not possess double-membrane structures reminiscent of autophagosomes.

<bold>Morphological features of TRIAD are distinct from those of apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy.</bold> (A) 10â30% of HeLa cells treated with 25 Î¼g/ml AMA for 24 h (HeLa-TRIAD) showed cytoplasmic vacuoles (white arrows) proximal to the nucleus (Nucl). Electron microscopic analysis of cortical neurons treated with 25 Î¼g/ml AMA for 48 h (CTX neuron TRIAD) revealed similar cytoplasmic vacuoles. Absence of chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation distinguishes TRIAD from classical apoptosis. The normal cytoplasm or mitochondria also excludes typical necrosis (bottom left). Electron microscopic analysis of primary cortical neurons in necrosis after freeze-thaw treatment (CTX neuron necrosis) showed the dilation of mitochondria (white arrows) and the rupture of cytoplasm (black arrows).

Autophagosomes induced by rapamycin and labeled with EGFP-LC3, a marker protein of the autophagosome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, top and middle), failed to colocalize with AMA-induced vacuoles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom). In addition, the size of AMA-induced vacuoles was larger than that of autophagosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom). EGFP-LC3 actually expresses the LC3 peptide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, arrow), verifying the morphological result. Note that the immunoblot shows a nonspecific band that is consistently detected by this antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, asterisk; unpublished data). Furthermore, the addition of rapamycin to the medium increased LC3-positive vacuoles but did not affect the formation of LC3-negative vacuoles induced by AMA (Fig. S3 A).Collectively, these data suggested that AMA-induced cell death is distinct from autophagy. Finally, we found colocalization of the vacuoles with ECFP-ER fusion constructs (expressing calreticulin ER-targeting sequences and KDEL ER retrieval tags at the 5â² and 3â² ends, respectively, of ECFP; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

        <title>Novel YAP isoforms are expressed in neurons specifically</title>
        <p>To understand the molecular basis of TRIAD, we conducted microarray analysis and compared gene expression profiles between TRIAD and low potassiumâinduced apoptosis in primary neurons. To detect initial changes, neurons were harvested at 1 h for RNA preparation. Duplicate experiments allowed us to extract eight genes whose expression levels changed in both apoptosis and TRIAD and a further 11 genes whose expression was changed specifically in TRIAD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The latter group included YAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), a transcriptional coactivator of p73 mediating apoptosis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Basu et al., 2003</xref>).

        <p>Surprisingly, however, we identified novel isoforms of YAP containing 13-, 25-, and 61-nt inserts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>) in addition to the full-length form by PCR cloning with RNA extracted from nontreated normal cortical and cerebellar neurons. The insert sequences matched genomic sequence with consensus junction sequences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).

Tissue expression profiling by RT-PCR revealed that the 13- and 61-nt insert isoforms (denoted here as Ins13 and Ins61, respectively) relatively specific to neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Brain tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>, third lane; not CTX or CBL neurons), including many glial and nonneuronal cells, showed only faint signals of the 13-nt variant comparable with those seen in other tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Ins61 was highly specific to cortical neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). The 25-nt insert could not be detected by RT-PCR.

Truncation of the transcriptional activation domain (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yagi et al., 1999</xref>) in YAP may impede transduction of the cell death stimulus, and YAPÎCs may act as dominant negatives against FL-YAP.

        <p>The suppression of TRIAD by YAPÎCs suggested, in turn, that p73, the target transcription factor of FL-YAP, would be activated in TRIAD.

As expected, AMA accelerated the phosphorylation of p73, whereas the total amount of p73 was not changed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Together with the former results, YAPÎCs might inhibit the action of p73, leading neurons to apoptosis by antagonizing FL-YAP, especially at the early phase of TRIAD when FL-YAP is still expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>).</p>

It suggests that the full-length p73 is phosphorylated in striatal neurons. Bottom panels show that YAPÎC isoforms were colocalized with phosphorylated p73 in striatal neurons (bottom, white arrows). However, a minor portion of neurons expresses only p73 (red arrows).</p>

</title>
        <p>Finally, we examined the in vivo effect of YAPÎCs on Htt-induced neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 1998</xref>). We generated more than three transgenic fly lines of human YAPÎCs. In the transgenic flies, the expression of YAPÎC protein was triggered by GMR-GAL4 that directs expression in the developing and adult eyes. To analyze the effects on photoreceptor neuron degeneration and/or the characteristic eye phenotype induced by the expression of human Htt120Q, we compared eye phenotypes between the F1 sibling fl ies at 10 d directly under the microscopy or by toluidine blue staining of 2-Î¼m sections of epon-embedded eye tissues. Ommatidia structure and photoreceptor neurons were severely disrupted in GMR-Htt120Q/GMR-GAL4 double-transgenic flies (BL8533; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 1998</xref>), whereas the expression of YAPÎC with a 61-nt insert (YAPÎC61) markedly preserved structure in triple-transgenic flies (GMR-Htt120Q/GMR-GAL4/UAS-YAPÎC61; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref>). Expression levels of YAPÎC61 and Htt120Q were checked in the same fly in parallel (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 B</xref>). Quantitative analysis of rhabdomere numbers per ommatidium in four independent transgenic fly lines supported the repression of neurodegeneration by YAPÎC61 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 C</xref>). We observed similar improvement of neurodegeneration in other YAPÎC transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies (not depicted). Collectively, these in vivo data further suggest the possibility that YAPÎC isoforms might play a protective role against the toxicity of mutant Htt in HD pathology.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we report atypical neuronal death induced by transcriptional repression (TRIAD). Transcriptional repression by Pol IIâspecific inhibitors leads to a very slow atypical neuronal death whose progression is clearly different from the well-known cell death prototypes. A morphological feature of TRIAD might be the vacuolization of ER, although it should be stressed that the majority of neurons (&gt;90%) do not show remarkable morphological changes. These findings might be relevant to the roles of transcriptional disturbance in HD disease (for review see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gusella and MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zoghbi and Orr, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bates, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Okazawa, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sugars and Rubinsztein, 2003</xref>). In addition, the lengthy progression of TRIAD might cast light on the basic question of why neurons stay alive under neurodegeneration for a long period.</p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, there are a few atypical cell deaths that might be partially analogous to TRIAD. One is a lengthy cell death of <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> during sorocarp formation, in which dying cells show cytoplasmic vacuolization (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cornillon et al., 1994</xref>). The second, termed paraptosis, is induced by the overexpression of the intracellular domain of insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor in 293T cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sperandio, et al., 2000</xref>). Paraptosis is characterized by vacuolization of the ER but no nuclear fragmentation, cellular blebbing, or apoptotic body formation (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sperandio, et al., 2000</xref>). These two atypical cell deaths might share molecular pathways (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wyllie and Goldstein, 2001</xref>). Although TRIAD shows a related morphological change, TRIAD is clearly different from paraptosis, as the latter is inhibited by both actinomycin D and cycloheximide (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sperandio, et al., 2000</xref>). Another point that distinguishes TRIAD from paraptosis is the cell death stimulus. Paraptosis was reported only in ectopic expression of truncated IGF-I receptor in nonneuronal cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sperandio, et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the role that we find for YAP in TRIAD has not been demonstrated in paraptosis or <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cell death. It is noteworthy that <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Degterev et al. (2005)</xref> has recently reported a new type of cell deathânecroptosis. They showed that in the absence of intracellular apoptotic signaling, extrinsic TNF stimulation triggers nonapoptotic cell death, showing necrotic morphology and autophagy. Although rapamycin did not increase typical LC3-negative vacuoles of TRIAD (Fig. S3) negating the autophagic component in TRIAD, we need to analyze carefully the relationship between TRIAD and necroptosis, including the viewpoint of cell death speed.</p>
      <p>It is also necessary to consider TRIAD with previous classifications of cell death. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Schweichel and Merker (1973)</xref> classified three types of cell death. Type 1 was manifested as nuclear condensation and pyknosis, reduced cytoplasmic volume, and late cell fragmentation/phagocytosis. Type 2 was an autophagic vacuolization in the cytoplasm, and type 3 was described as cytoplasmic cell death in which general organelle breakdown was apparent. Type 1 is apoptosis, and types 2 and 3 were necrotic (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Schweichel and Merker, 1973</xref>). In 1990, Peter Clarke redefined an earlier model of cell death developed by Schweichel and Merker (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, 1990</xref>). Clarke's modification was to expand the forms of cytoplasmic cell death into types 3A and 3B. 3A is a nonlysosomal breakdown, and 3B is cytoplasmic (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Clarke, 1990</xref>). Cells undergoing the 3A type of cell death show an initial swelling of cytoplasmic organelles and the generation of vacuoles that eventually fuse with the extracellular space. A breakup of cell structure without autophagic or heterophagic activity occurs. In type 3B death, which is also known as the cytoplasmic form of cell death, swollen organelles (dilated perinuclear space, ER, and Golgi apparatus) are apparent as well as vacuoles. The cell membrane retracts, and the nucleus becomes karyolytic/edematous. Heterophagic elimination can occur. Type 3B has also been termed paraptosis/oncosis. Among these, TRIAD is close to type 3B. However, in addition to the aforementioned reason, TRIAD seems to be different from type 3B because vacuolization of ER is far more remarkable than morphological changes of other organelles in TRIAD.</p>
      <p>In HD models, several studies have reported atypical cell death with cytoplasmic vacuolization. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sapp et al. (1997)</xref> reported that mutant Htt accumulates in punctate structures mimicking endosomalâlysosomal organelles of affected HD neurons. They further showed by extensive analyses, including immunoelectron microscopy, that mutant Htt appears in autophagosomes (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kegel et al., 2000</xref>). Other studies also pointed out the possible involvement of autophagy in the HD disease pathology (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nagata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ravikumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Iwata et al., 2005</xref>). Meanwhile, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hirabayashi et al. (2001)</xref> isolated VCP (valosin-containing protein)/p97, a member of the AAA+ family of ATPase proteins, as a HD-interacting protein. The expression of the mutant form of VCP leads to cytoplasmic vacuolization, which might be homologous to vacuoles in TRIAD because they were fused to ER (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hirabayashi et al., 2001</xref>). Collectively, although our results so far seem to negate the identity of the TRIAD vacuoles to autophagosomes, we cannot exclude the possibility that they might share certain characteristics with the vacuoles reported in HD models.</p>
      <p>As for the molecular pathway of TRIAD, YAPÎCs and p73 might modify the process. Up- or down-regulation of YAPÎCs suppresses or enhances TRIAD in cortical neurons, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Together with evidence that AMA treatment increases active p73 in neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>) and that YAPÎCs remain during TRIAD of cortical neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>), these data suggest that p73-mediated cell death signaling might be attenuated by YAPÎCs in TRIAD. Consistently, the percentage of morphologically changed neurons (vacuole-possessing neurons) was very low. It might be a reason why TRIAD does not progress rapidly like apoptosis.</p>
      <p>p73 was activated in human and mouse HD pathology in vivo (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). YAPÎC isoforms were coexpressed in affected neurons of human HD patients (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Repression of p73 and expression of YAPÎCs attenuated Htt-induced neuronal cell death of primary neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and D</xref>), whereas YAPÎC repression enhanced the neuronal cell death (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Furthermore, YAPÎC isoforms suppressed neurodegeneration of photoreceptor cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in vivo (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). These findings suggest that YAPÎCs and p73 might be relevant to the HD pathology.</p>
      <p>p53 has been implicated in the HD pathology because p53 coaggregates with mutant Htt (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Steffan et al., 2000</xref>). <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bae et al. (2005)</xref> recently reported that mutant Htt interacts with, translocates, and activates p53. They also showed that mating mutant Htt transgenic mice with p53-null mice ameliorates neurological symptoms by mutant Htt (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bae et al., 2005</xref>). These results suggest that p53 activation promotes the HD pathology. Because p73 and p53 belong to the same family of transcription factors recognizing a similar consensus sequence on genomic DNA (for review see <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Irwin and Miller, 2004</xref>), the common cascade shared by the two factors should be investigated in the HD pathology. For instance, upstream signals activating these two factors and target gene activation by these transcription factors in the HD pathology should be analyzed in the future. On the other hand, because p53 is suggested to have a direct effect on mitochondria (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mihara et al., 2003</xref>), it might be necessary to test whether p73 also plays a similar role.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that hyperactive p73 could trigger vacuolar changes of ER in nonneuronal cells (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Terrinoni et al., 2004</xref>). If this is true, the vacuole formation in TRIAD might be triggered by activated p73. In this case, although ER stress could be induced by mutant polyQ protein (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kouroku et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nishitoh et al., 2002</xref>), ER stress might also be evoked by a signal from the nucleus in parallel. Investigation on the possible connection between the nucleus and ER might contribute to understanding the polyQ pathology. The hypothetical pathway should be examined and elucidated in the future. In summary, our results present a novel model of cell death that might cast more light on the HD pathology.</p>

Labeling and amplification of RNA was performed using the Agilent Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (G2554A; Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First, double-stranded cDNAs with a T7 promoter were synthesized from 2 Î¼g of total RNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using an oligonucleotide dT-primer, which contains the T7 promoter sequence, and random hexamers (40Â°C for 4 h). Then, using these double-stranded cDNAs as templates, cRNA was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase using Cy3- or Cy5-labeled CTP (40Â°C for 1 h). cRNAs from AMA-treated cortical neurons, AMA-treated cerebellar neurons, or low potassiumâexposed cerebellar neurons were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Synthesized cRNA was precipitated with lithium chloride, ethanol rinsed, and dissolved in nuclease-free water. To check the quality of cRNA, OD<sub>260</sub>, OD<sub>280</sub>, A<sub>552</sub> (for Cy3), and A<sub>650</sub> (for Cy5) measurements were taken.

Cell lysates prepared from wells containing either 3.3 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> HeLa cells or 1.0 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> primary neurons were subject to SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Fine Trap; Nihon Eido), incubated with each primary antibody for 1 h and the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min, and visualized using the ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). The dilution conditions for primary and secondary antibodies were as follows: anti-YAP polyclonal rabbit antibody (H-125; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:1,000; anti-GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) at 1:100,000; HRP-conjugated antiâmouse IgG (GE Healthcare) at 1:5,000; and HRP-conjugated antiârabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) at 1:3,000. Anti-YAPÎC rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the common COOH-terminal peptide (SVFSRDDSGIEDNDNQ) by immunizing rabbits and was used for Western blotting at a 1:1,000 dilution.</p>

        <title>Adenovirus vector construction</title>
        <p>The replication-defective adenovirus vectors were constructed by using the Adenovirus Expression Vector Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cDNAs of YAP isoforms were digested with EcoRI and SalI from pBSYAP-FL (containing rat FL-YAP), pBSins13, pBSins25, and pBSins61. Ends were blunted using the blunting high kit (Toyobo), and each insert was subcloned into the SwaI site of the pAxCAwt cosmid (Takara). The resultant cosmids were transfected into 293T cells by the calcium-phosphate method with digested DNA of adenovirus and the medium containing dead cells recovered as the virus solution. After two or three rounds of amplification (5 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> and â¼5 Ã 10<sup>9</sup> plaque-forming units/ml), clonality was checked by restriction with endonucleases and PCR. We designated the adenovirus vectors AxCAYAP-FL, AxCAins13, AxCAins25, and AxCAins61. The vectors were used for infection of HeLa cells and primary neurons at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. Preliminary examination of the efficiency of protein expression and toxicity of adenovirus was performed by infecting primary neurons with a vector for EGFP and a mock vector at multiple MOI, respectively. More than 90% of the neurons expressed EGFP at an MOI of 100. The difference in cell death percentage between noninfected and mock-infected neurons estimated by trypan blue staining was &lt;3% when the MOI did not exceed 500.</p>

Separated RNAs were capillary blotted to Hybond-N (GE Healthcare) and fixed by UV cross-linking (120,000 Î¼J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Full-length cDNA of ins61 was digested from pBSins61, purified from gel, and radiolabeled using Î±-[<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (GE Healthcare) and a random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara). <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes were hybridized to nylon membrane at 60Â°C overnight with shaking. Hybridized membrane was rinsed with 1Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50Â°C for 20 min twice, and with 0.1Ã SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60Â°C for 20 min twice.

        <p>HeLa cells and cortical neurons were treated with 10 Î¼g/ml AMA for 6 h and 2 d, respectively. For the Htt experiments, HeLa cells and primary cortical neurons were harvested 2 d after infection. HeLa cells or primary cortical neurons were dissolved in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% NP-40, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mM NaF), and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. Nonspecific binding proteins were removed by preincubation with protein GâSepharose beads (GE Healthcare), and anti-p73 goat polyclonal antibody (S-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the supernatant at 1:200. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4Â°C and precipitated by protein GâSepharose beads for 1 h at 4Â°C. After washing five times with TNE, the precipitate was boiled in 2Ã loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. The filter was blotted with the anti-p73 goat polyclonal antibody (S-20; 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or antiphosphorylated p73 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000; Cell Signaling) followed by HRP-coupled detection. For analysis of p73 phosphorylation in human brain, each sample of striatum was homogenized in 20Ã vol TNE and subjected to the detection of p73 phosphorylation by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.</p>

After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were incubated sequentially with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase, 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at RT, and either a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for full-length p73 that was raised against the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 80 amino acids of p73 (H-79; 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), an antiphospho-p73 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:50; Cell Signaling), or an anti-YAPÎC rabbit polyclonal antibody against the common COOH-terminal peptide (SVFSRDDSGIEDNDNQ) of YAPÎC isoforms (1:100). These incubations were overnight at 4Â°C. The slides were incubated with antiârabbit EnVision conjugates of secondary antibody (DakoCytomation) for 1 h at RT and visualized with DAB (Sigma-Aldrich). The same protocol was applied for immunohistochemistry of human brain sections. For double staining, each section after the first staining was agitated in stripping buffer (0.05 M glycine-HCl, pH 3.6) for 3 h at RT, hybridized with antiâglial fibrillary acidic protein polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Chemicon) overnight at 4Â°C and with antiârabbit EnVision conjugates of secondary antibody (DakoCytomation) for 1 h at RT, and visualized with DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) containing NiCl<sub>2</sub> 6H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

        <p>Fly culture and mating were carried at 25 and 60% humidity. P(GMR-GAL4) (BL8121) and P(GMR-HD120Q) (BL8533) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 1998</xref>) were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. The UAS-YAPins13, 25, and 61 transgenic flies were generated by cloning the corresponding human cDNA into pUAST transformation vector and injecting the construct DNA into cantonized w(cs10) (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dura et al., 1993</xref>) by standard methods (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rubin and Spradling, 1982</xref>). Genotypes of the YAP transgenic flies were determined by mating them with double balancer flies, and they were kept with a balancer gene before use. To analyze the effects of YAPins61 on photoreceptor neuron degeneration and/or the characteristic eye phenotype induced by the expression of human Htt 120Q, we compared eye phenotypes between the F1 sibling flies (GMR-HD120Q/UAS-YAPÎ61;GMR-GAL4/+ vs. GMR-HD120Q/+; GMR-GAL4/+) directly under the microscopy VH5000 (Keyence) or by toluidine blue staining of 2-Î¼m sections of epon-embedded eye tissues.</p>
