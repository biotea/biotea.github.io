        <p>Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of PDZ-RhoGEF restricts RhoA activity to facilitate neurite outgrowth.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The induction of neurite outgrowth and arborization is critical for developmental and regenerative processes. In this paper, we report that the BTB-kelch protein KLHL20 promoted neurite outgrowth and arborization in hippocampal and cortical neurons through its interaction with Cullin3 to form a ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex targeted PDZâRho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF), a protein abundantly expressed in the brain, for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, thereby restricting RhoA activity and facilitating growth cone spreading and neurite outgrowth. Importantly, targeting PDZ-RhoGEF to KLHL20 required PDZ-RhoGEF phosphorylation by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In response to p38-activating neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3, KLHL20-mediated PDZ-RhoGEF destruction was potentiated, leading to neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth. Our study identified a ubiquitin-dependent pathway that targets PDZ-RhoGEF destruction to facilitate neurite outgrowth and indicates a key role of this pathway in neurotrophin-induced neuronal morphogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Neurite outgrowth and arborization are crucial for establishing anatomical connections during the development and remodeling of the nervous system. The Rho family GTPases, such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate various aspects of neuronal differentiation, including neurite outgrowth and arborization, by activating multiple effector pathways that affect actin and microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Luo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Govek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hall and Lalli, 2010</xref>). Rho GTPases are activated by a large family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schmidt and Hall, 2002</xref>), and several RhoGEFs are known to regulate neuronal morphogenesis in response to a variety of extracellular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rossman et al., 2005</xref>). Among them, the brain-enriched PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kuner et al., 2002</xref>) is activated by interacting with the activated GÎ±12/13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fukuhara et al., 1999</xref>), thereby mediating the neurite retraction effect of lysophosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Togashi et al., 2000</xref>). PDZ-RhoGEF also plays a role in axon guidance by interacting with plexin-B1, thereby mediating semaphorin 4Dâinduced Rho activation, growth cone collapse, and axon retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Perrot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). Although PDZ-RhoGEF is known to induce neurite or axon retraction, it is unclear whether and how its activity is restrained under conditions that permit neurite outgrowth.</p>
      <p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays crucial roles in various aspects of neuronal development, such as axon formation, elongation, and pruning, and synapse formation and elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yi and Ehlers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tai and Schuman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Segref and Hoppe, 2009</xref>). The Cullin3 (Cul3)-based ubiquitin E3 ligases use BTB domainâcontaining proteins as substrate adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). We recently identified KLHL20, a protein possessing a BTB domain and six kelch repeats, as such an adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Based on the expression pattern illustrated in the Genepaint database, <italic>KLHL20</italic> mRNA is abundantly expressed in the brain of an embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse embryo, implying its role in neural development. In the adult mouse brain (Allen Brain Atlas), <italic>KLHL20</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in the hippocampus, especially in the dentate gyrus, where a lifelong neurogenesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ming and Song, 2005</xref>). Here, we show that the KLHL20-based E3 ligase targets PDZ-RhoGEF for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby participating in neurotrophin-induced neurite growth.</p>

        <title>KLHL20 promotes neurite outgrowth/arborization</title>
        <p>We first determined the expression of the KLHL20 protein and its subcellular distribution in primary rat hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescent analysis, and antibody specificity was confirmed by the reduction of staining intensity in neurons expressing KLHL20 siRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201103015/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). KLHL20 was distributed throughout the cell body, axon, and dendrites, albeit at a lower expression level in dendrites than the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To investigate the effect of KLHL20 on neuronal morphogenesis, hippocampal neurons at day in vitro (DIV) 0 were transfected with KLHL20 and analyzed at DIV2 or DIV5. At both time points, we detected an increase of neurite lengths in cells overexpressing KLHL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1, B and C</xref>; and S1 B). Furthermore, this effect was more significantly observed in axon than dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top). KLHL20 also increased the complexity of the neurite arbor. This was reflected by the increase of dendrite number and axon branching, and the latter was inferred by a higher branch order and shorter distance from soma to the first branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom). KLHL20, however, did not affect neuronal polarity (Fig. S1 C). Overexpression of KLHL20 in primary cortical neurons also stimulated neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 D</xref> and S1 D). However, introducing KLHL20m6, a mutant defective in Cul3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), to hippocampal or cortical neurons failed to elicit any effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, BâD</xref>). We further showed that KLHL20-induced neurite outgrowth was abrogated by Cul3 siRNA (Fig. S1 E). Our data suggest that KLHL20 promotes neurite outgrowth/arborization through the formation of a KLHL20âCul3 complex.</p>

        <title>KLHL20 interacts with PDZ-RhoGEF</title>
        <p>To identify the substrate of Cul3âKLHL20 mediating the neuronal morphogenesis function of KLHL20, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the substrate-binding, kelch repeat domain as bait. Several positive clones identified in this screen encoded for C-terminal fragments of PDZ-RhoGEF. Notably, KLHL20 interacted specifically with PDZ-RhoGEF(951â1,562) but not with a corresponding fragment of a related protein, LARG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the interaction of KLHL20-Myc with PDZ-RhoGEFâFlag in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This interaction was abolished by deleting the kelch repeat domain of KLHL20 (KLHL20ÎK), whereas the kelch repeat domain alone was sufficient for interaction. An in vitro binding assay demonstrated that GST-KLHL20 could specifically pull down baculovirally purified PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Furthermore, using in vitro binding and immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that the C-terminal segment (amino acids 960â1,309) of PDZ-RhoGEF was required for KLHL20 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). The binding of endogenous KLHL20 to endogenous PDZ-RhoGEF was observed using mouse brain extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). We further detected an interaction of endogenous PDZ-RhoGEF with endogenous Cul3, and this interaction was diminished by depletion of KLHL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Likewise, coimmunoprecipitation of Cul3 with both KLHL20 and PDZ-RhoGEF was observed using primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Together, these data indicate PDZ-RhoGEF as a KLHL20-interacting protein and reveal the formation of a Cul3âKLHL20âPDZ-RhoGEF tripartite complex.</p>

        <title>KLHL20 promotes PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination and destruction to inactivate RhoA</title>
        <p>We next examined the effect of KLHL20-based ligase on PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination. The ubiquitination level of PDZ-RhoGEF was greatly elevated by coexpression of Cul3, KLHL20, and Roc1 (a subunit of the Cul3 complex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Replacement of KLHL20 with KLHL20m6 or Cul3 with Cul3H2/5, a mutant defective in binding BTB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xu et al., 2003</xref>), failed to promote PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination. Depletion of KLHL20 by two independent siRNAs suppressed PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). To demonstrate PDZ-RhoGEF as a direct substrate of the Roc1âCul3âKLHL20 ligase, in vitro ubiquitination was performed. Incubation of the KLHL20âCul3âRoc1 complex purified from transfected cells with baculovirally purified PDZ-RhoGEF in the in vitro ubiquitination reaction resulted in PDZ-RhoGEF polyubiquitination. Omission of the ubiquitin, E1, E2, or E3 complex abrogated this ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination was also impaired by the replacement of KLHL20 with KLHL20m6 or KLHL20ÎK or Cul3 with Cul3ÎC (a mutant defective in Roc1 binding). These results indicate PDZ-RhoGEF as a bona fide substrate of the Roc1âCul3âKLHL20 ligase.</p>

        <p>Most cullin-based ligases catalyze K48-linked polyubiquitination to promote substrate degradation. Accordingly, overexpression of KLHL20, but not KLHL20ÎK or KLHL20m6, decreased the levels of ectopic and endogenous PDZ-RhoGEF, and this effect was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). A cycloheximide chase experiment revealed that KLHL20 enhanced PDZ-RhoGEF turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous PDZ-RhoGEF level was elevated in cells expressing KLHL20 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). These data support a role of KLHL20-associated ligase in promoting PDZ-RhoGEF proteasomal degradation. Next, we investigated the effect of KLHL20 on regulating RhoA. As expected, overexpression of PDZ-RhoGEF stimulated RhoA activity. This effect, however, was markedly attenuated by coexpression of KLHL20 but not KLHL20m6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Conversely, depletion of KLHL20 enhanced RhoA activity, which was reversed by overexpressing an siRNA-resistant KLHL20 (KLHL20<sup>r</sup>) or a PDZ-RhoGEFâspecific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>). Notably, in these two experiments, the alteration of RhoA activity correlated with the level of PDZ-RhoGEF. Finally, we showed that depletion of KLHL20 in hippocampal neurons also potentiated RhoA activity without affecting RhoA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 I</xref>). Our data support that KLHL20 promotes PDZ-RhoGEF degradation to inactivate RhoA.</p>

        <title>KLHL20 promotes neurite outgrowth and growth cone spreading through PDZ-RhoGEF degradation</title>
        <p>Given the well-documented role of RhoA in suppressing neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Luo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Govek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hall and Lalli, 2010</xref>), our findings suggest a contribution of PDZ-RhoGEF degradation to the neuronal morphogenesis function of KLHL20. In support of this notion, overexpression of PDZ-RhoGEF abolished the effect of KLHL20 on neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201103015/DC1">S2 A</ext-link>). In the next set of experiments, KLHL20 siRNA was introduced to hippocampal neurons, and its efficacy to deplete KLHL20 was confirmed (Fig. S2 B). We showed that neurons expressing KLHL20 siRNA displayed shorter neurites. This effect was rescued by cotransfection of KLHL20<sup>r</sup> but not its m6 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). More importantly, depletion of PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 B</xref> and S2 C) or blockage of the RhoA downstream effector Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) by Y27632 or myosin II by blebbistatin (Fig. S2 D) completely reversed the inhibitory effect of KLHL20 siRNA on neurite outgrowth. Notably, the KLHL20 siRNA failed to elicit any effect on Y27632- or blebbistatin-treated neurons (Fig. S2 D), suggesting that KLHL20, ROCK, and myosin II act in the same pathway to suppress neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <p>The growth cones undergo dynamic changes of their morphology in response to extracellular cues, thereby determining the growth or retraction of neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lowery and Van Vactor, 2009</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>), PDZ-RhoGEF overexpression markedly increased the percentage of hippocampal neurons displaying growth cone collapse. This effect was abolished by coexpression of KLHL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Expression of KLHL20 alone also attenuated growth cone collapse, presumably mediated by endogenous PDZ-RhoGEF. Conversely, KLHL20 siRNA induced growth cone collapse, and this effect was rescued by overexpression of KLHL20<sup>r</sup> but not its m6 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). More importantly, the effect of KLHL20 siRNA was also reversed by PDZ-RhoGEF silencing. Together, our data indicate that KLHL20-mediated PDZ-RhoGEF degradation is important to maintain growth cone spreading, thereby facilitating neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <title>KLHL20-mediated PDZ-RhoGEF destruction is potentiated by p38 MAPK and participates in neurotrophin-induced morphogenesis</title>
        <p>Next, we investigated whether the KLHL20-mediated PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination could be regulated by a physiological signal. Intriguingly, treatment of baculovirally purified PDZ-RhoGEF with calf intestine phosphatase abrogated its binding to KLHL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and ubiquitination by KLHL20âCul3âRoc1 in vitro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201103015/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). Preincubation of PDZ-RhoGEF with p38 MAPK, but not extracellular signalârelated kinase (ERK), in a kinase reaction potentiated the subsequent PDZ-RhoGEF ubiquitination catalyzed by the same E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5 B</xref> and S3 B). We further demonstrated that p38 directly phosphorylated PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) and that this phosphorylation promoted the PDZ-RhoGEF interaction with KLHL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Thus, p38-induced phosphorylation is crucial for targeting PDZ-RhoGEF to KLHL20-based E3 ligase. In line with this notion, pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK in hippocampal neurons increased PDZ-RhoGEF level and RhoA activity without affecting RhoA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ying et al., 2002</xref>), treatment of hippocampal neurons with neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) increased p38 activity. Importantly, this p38 activation was accompanied by a down-regulation of PDZ-RhoGEF, which was reversed by p38 inhibitor or KLHL20 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). The expression of LARG, however, was not affected. PDZ-RhoGEF down-regulation was also induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a p38- and KLHL20-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). These data suggest that these p38-activiating neurotrophins up-regulate the KLHL20-dependent PDZ-RhoGEF degradation pathway. Next, we determined the contribution of the p38âKLHL20âPDZ-RhoGEF signaling axis to neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth. The BDNF- and NT-3âinduced neurite outgrowth was significantly suppressed by KLHL20 depletion or p38 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>, compare second bar with third and fifth bars). Cotreatment of neurons with KLHL20 siRNA and p38 inhibitor, however, did not cause an additional inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>, sixth bar), suggesting that p38 and KLHL20 act in the same pathway. To address whether the suppressive effect of p38 inhibitor on neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth was caused by PDZ-RhoGEF up-regulation, PDZ-RhoGEF siRNA was introduced. PDZ-RhoGEF siRNA reversed the effect of p38 inhibitor on neurotrophin-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>, compare seventh bar with fifth bar). Notably, in neurotrophin-treated neurons without exposure to p38 inhibitor, PDZ-RhoGEF siRNA did not significantly affect neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>, compare second bar with fourth bar), which is consistent with a persistent degradation of PDZ-RhoGEF under such conditions. These results collectively support a critical role of the p38âKLHL20âPDZ-RhoGEF pathway in neurotrophin-induced neuronal morphogenesis.</p>

        <p>In summary, our study reveals a PDZ-RhoGEF degradation pathway mediated by p38 MAPK and KLHL20-based E3 ligase, thereby participating in neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth. RhoA has been well recognized as a negative regulator of neurite outgrowth, but how extracellular cues restrict RhoA activity to promote neuritogenesis is largely unknown. Our study provides important insights into the mechanism of RhoA regulation during physiological neuritogenesis and also implies a previously unrecognized role of KLHL20 in the proper development of neural circuits. In addition to neurotrophin-induced morphogenesis, PDZ-RhoGEF also participates in semaphorin 4Dâinduced axon guidance by interacting with the receptor plexin-B1 through its PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). However, PDZ-RhoGEF is constitutively associated with plexin-B1, and the interaction domain does not overlap with the KLHL20-binding region. Thus, it is unlikely that KLHL20 could affect semaphorin signaling by competing with plexin-B1 for PDZ-RhoGEF binding. Notably, BDNF was recently reported to induce UPS-dependent degradation of RhoA via a PKA/Smurf1-dependent pathway, thereby facilitating axon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). The UPS is also known to promote axonal outgrowth by targeting the RhoA downstream molecule LIM kinase 1 via the E3 ligase Rnf6 localized in an axonal growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tursun et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the UPS targets multiple proteins along the RhoA signaling pathway via distinct ubiquitin ligases to regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development.</p>
