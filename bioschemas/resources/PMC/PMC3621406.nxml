      <abstract>
        <p>Correct execution of mitosis in eukaryotes relies on timely activation and inactivation of cyclin B-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1), the M-phase-promoting factor (MPF). Once activated, MPF is sustained until mitotic spindle assembly by phosphorylation-dependent feedback loops that prevent inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk1 and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclin B. Whether subsequent MPF inactivation and anaphase onset require a specific phosphatase(s) to reverse these feedback loops is not known. Here we show through biochemical and genetic evidence that timely MPF inactivation requires activity of the essential RNA polymerase II-carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1, in a transcription-independent manner. We identify Cdc20, a coactivator of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) required for cyclin degradation and anaphase onset, USP44, a deubiquitinating peptidase that opposes APC/C action, and Wee1, a cdk1 inhibitory kinase, as relevant Fcp1 targets. We propose that Fcp1 has a crucial role in the liaison between dephosphorylation and ubiquitination that drives mitosis exit.</p>

    <p>The establishment of mitosis requires phosphorylation of several substrates operated by several kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Until mitotic spindle assembly, M-phase-promoting factor (MPF) activity itself is sustained through phosphorylation-dependent feedback loops<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Mitotic phosphorylations inhibit Wee1 and Myt1, cyclin B-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) inhibitory kinases, activate Cdc25C, cdk1-activating phosphatase and implement the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a safeguard mechanism that prevents premature cdk1 inactivation and anaphase onset by delaying degradation of cyclin B and of the anaphase inhibitor securin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Although the precise mechanism(s) by which SAC requires phosphorylation is still unclear, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of Cdc20 and USP44 promotes SAC action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To return to the interphase state, mitotic phosphorylations must be reversed by the end of mitosis. Indeed, it has been shown that, downstream of MPF inactivation, mitosis completion in vertebrate cells requires the action of phosphatases like PP1 and PP2A (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, whether reversal of mitotic phosphorylations is required for MPF inactivation in vertebrates is unclear.</p>
    <p>In this study, by biochemical and genetic experiments in human cells, we show that at the end of mitosis timely MPF inactivation requires activity of the Fcp1 phosphatase. We identified Cdc20, Usp44 and Wee1 as crucial Fcp1 targets. We conclude that Fcp1 is required for mitosis exit by reversing phosphorylation of controllers of both proteolysis- and phosphorylation-dependent means of MPF inactivation.</p>

        <title>Fcp1 is required for M-phase exit in HeLa cell extracts</title>
        <p>To determine whether cdk1 inactivation and anaphase onset required reversal of MPF-sustaining phosphorylations, we first analysed the effect of the potent PP1 and PP2A phosphatases inhibitor okadaic acid (o.a.) on cyclin B degradation in HeLa cells. The cells were exiting mitosis on release from SAC-dependent arrest induced by the reversible microtubule inhibitor nocodazole. O.a. did not prevent cyclin B degradation and anaphase onset nor dissociation of the inhibitory SAC protein Mad2 from anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). However, it substantially delayed dephosphorylation of several mitotic phosphoepitopes, recognized by the MPM-2 monoclonal antibody, and mitosis exit downstream cdk1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), in agreement with previously described results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Under our conditions, o.a. may robustly inhibit PP2A but only partly PP1, nevertheless, it has been shown that specific PP1 inhibition in checkpoint HeLa cell extracts did not prevent cdk1 inactivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus, if dephosphorylations were needed for cdk1 inactivation at mitosis exit they likely involved phosphatase(s) other than PP1 and PP2A. In the search for a relevant phosphatase(s), we considered recent genetic data from <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (AN) showing an antagonism between the essential, o.a. resistant, RNA polymerase II-carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1 and cdk1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In AN, a defective Fcp1 allele genetically interacted with an inhibitory phosphorylation-resistant cdk1 allele and forced expression of both alleles deranged mitosis and impaired nuclear separation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, as Fcp1 is a crucial transcription regulator, the genetic approach could not discern whether mitotic defects were due to lack of Fcp1-dependent dephosphorylation of mitotic regulators or rather to changes in gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. To unveil a direct link between Fcp1 phosphatase activity and cdk1 inactivation, extracts from mitotic, SAC-arrested, HeLa cells were used that, devoid of nuclei, inactivate SAC, degrade cyclin B and progress out of M-phase <italic>in vitro</italic> (checkpoint extracts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Checkpoint extracts were either mock- or Fcp1-depleted, and Fcp1-depleted extracts were also reconstituted with recombinant, active, 3XFlag-tagged Fcp1 (3F-Fcp1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Whereas in control extracts, cyclin degradation was initiated after a 120-min lag and extracts exited the mitotic state thereafter, as indicated by decline in MPM-2 signal in Fcp1-depleted extracts cyclin B and MPM-2 signals remained stable for up to 6 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Importantly, cyclin degradation and M-phase exit were restored in 3F-Fcp1-reconstituted extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, in undepleted extracts, a threefold excess of 3F-Fcp1 accelerated cyclin degradation and M-phase exit relatively to a control extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The same excess of a mutant, catalytic inactive, Fcp1 version (3F-Fcp1-CD) on the contrary delayed both events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). 3F-Fcp1-CD acted in a dominant negative manner perhaps by interacting with endogenous Fcp1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, Fcp1 appears to be required for M-phase exit independently of its transcriptional role, perhaps by directly dephosphorylating crucial mitotic substrates.</p>

        <title>Fcp1-dependent dephosphorylations at M-phase exit</title>
        <p>To identify potential Fcp1 targets for MPF inactivation, we first analysed the dephosphorylation kinetics of proteins whose mitotic phosphorylation has been involved in the control of MPF activity during early stages of mitosis exit in cells. We analysed Wee1, Myt1 and Cdc25C, controllers of inhibitory cdk1 phosphorylation, and Cdc20, Cdc27, an APC/C member, and USP44, controllers of cyclin degradation, from HeLa cells sampled at short intervals during release from SAC-dependent arrest. Dephosphorylation was monitored by detecting increased protein mobility on SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for all proteins and for Wee1, Myt1, Cdc25C and Cdc27 also by loss of site-specific mitotic phosphorylation. We developed an antibody recognizing phosphothreonine 239 of Wee1 (p-T239-Wee1), a crucial phosphorylation for cdk1-dependent inhibition of Wee1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, whereas p-S83-Myt1, p-T48-Cdc25C and p-T244-Cdc27 were detected by commercially available antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). USP44 dephosphorylation was followed in cells transiently transfected with a V5-tagged USP44 expression vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Increased migration of Wee1, USP44, Cdc20 and loss of p-T239-Wee1 signal ensued rapidly after release from nocodazole, when cyclin B1 was still stable (by 10â20 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This was ahead of dephosphorylation of Myt1, Cdc25C and Cdc27, that begun at later time points, along with, or slightly after, initiation of cyclin B1 degradation (by 30â40 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Rapid p-T239-Wee1 dephosphorylation was also detected during SAC resolution in non-transformed human hTERT-RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, dephosphorylation of Wee1, Cdc20 and USP44 began concomitantly during spindle assembly and apparently before significant degradation of cyclin. Like the major biochemical reactions of mitosis exit in living cells, checkpoint extracts reproduced the changes in the phosphorylation status of these proteins during M-phase exit (see below), thus, we asked whether these changes depended on the presence of Fcp1. Indeed, depletion/reconstitution experiments showed that dephosphorylation of Wee1, particularly T239-Wee1, Cdc20 and USP44 depended on Fcp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Moreover, activities of Wee1 and USP44 were also dependent on the presence of Fcp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Wee1 kinase activity remained low in Fcp1-depleted extracts while it increased in control extracts and in Fcp1-reconstituted extract that exited M-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Ubiquitin peptidase activity of USP44, measured by an <italic>in vitro</italic> deubiquitination assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, decreased during incubation in control and Fcp1-reconstituted extracts, which cycled from M-phase into interphase, whereas it remained high in Fcp1-depleted extract for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). USP44 activity has been shown to help to maintain the binding of the SAC inhibitory Mad2 to Cdc20 and to regulate Cdc20 ubiquitination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Indeed, we found that more than 90% of Mad2 had dissociated from Cdc20 after a 4-h incubation in control and Fcp1-reconstituted extracts, whereas dissociation was prevented in the Fcp1-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In addition, while in control and Fcp1-reconstituted extracts about 60â70% of Cdc20 was degraded during incubation, Cdc20 remained stable in the Fcp1-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), further suggesting a functional relationship between Fcp1 and USP44 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). We also found that a short treatment with a cdk1 inhibitor accelerated Wee1, Cdc20 and USP44 dephosphorylations in control extracts but it failed to do so in Fcp1-depleted extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that Fcp1 is required for MPF inactivation by reversing crucial mitotic phosphorylations and indicate a direct antagonism between Fcp1 and cdk1.</p>

        <title>Putative direct Fcp1 targets for M-phase exit</title>
        <p>We asked whether Fcp1 could directly dephosphorylate the relevant substrates for exit from mitosis. <italic>In vitro</italic>, active 3F-Fcp1 dephosphorylated mitotic Wee1, Cdc20 and USP44 but not Cdc27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). When analysed by SDSâPAGE, 3F-Fcp1-dephosphorylated proteins had an intermediate migration between that from SAC-arrested and G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that Fcp1 dephosphorylated only a subset of phosphosites in these proteins, perhaps favouring the action of other phosphatases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Several reports have demonstrated the relevance for mitotic phosphoryation of Cdc20 and Wee1, particularly p-T239-Wee1, in the control of their activies towards MPF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. USP44 activity has also been hypothesized to be regulated by phosphorylation, in particular, mitotic phosphorylation is thought to stimulate its deubiquitinating activity required to sustain SAC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We found that pretreatment of active USP44 <italic>in vitro</italic>, isolated from SAC-arrested cells, with active 3F-Fcp1 substantially reduced USP44 ubiquitin peptidase activity, whereas pretreatment with the catalytic dead 3F-Fcp1-CD mutant had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In addition, we produced a mutant human USP44 (USP44-4A) protein that cannot be phosphorylated at four potential cdk1 or mitotic sites (ser-169, -239, -401 and threo-269). When expressed and analysed in SAC-arrested cells, USP44-4A showed a faster migration on SDSâPAGE than wild-type USP44, suggesting that these residues are phosphorylated under active SAC conditions in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In addition, when assayed <italic>in vitro</italic>, USP44-4A had significantly reduced ubiquitin peptidase activity compared with wild-type USP44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how Fcp1 activity could promote exit from mitosis and suggest that Fcp1 may directly promote crucial dephosphorylations that are required for MPF inactivation.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Fcp1 affects mitotis exit in human cells</title>
        <p>Having established that Fcp1 phosphatase activity is required for MPF inactivation independently of its effects on transcription regulation in the <italic>in vitro</italic> checkpoint extract system, we asked whether Fcp1 affected SAC resolution and mitosis exit in living cells. Strong Fcp1 downregulation could be obtained in HeLa cells by treatment with a pool of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the Fcp1-coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) or with one siRNA targeting a segment of the Fcp1 3â² untranslated region (UTR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Strong Fcp1 downregulation delayed cell cycle progression at different cell cycle stages, however, Fcp1-siRNA-treated cells that could be SAC-arrested, following nocodazole treatment, were substantially delayed in cyclin B1 degradation and mitosis exit upon release from SAC-arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Although we cannot exclude subtle alterations in spindle assembly, morphological analysis indicated that Fcp1-siRNA-treated cells progressed into metaphase with similar kinetics as control cells but were delayed thereafter. In Fcp1-siRNA-UTR-treated cells, the mitosis exit delay was reversed by re-expression of siRNA-resistant 3F-Fcp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). We asked whether overexpression of 3F-Fcp1 or the catalytically dead 3F-Fcp1-CD mutant would affect mitosis exit in HeLa cells similar to what was observed in checkpoint extracts. Indeed, HeLa cells overexpressing 3F-Fcp1, about threefold over endogenous Fcp1 levels, showed an acceleration in exiting mitosis upon SAC resolution while expression of the same level of 3F-Fcp1-CD significantly delayed mitosis exit kinetics upon SAC resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). These data confirm the requirement for Fcp1 in SAC-dependent arrest resolution in living cells. Although Fcp1 overexpressing cells tended to adapt and exit mitosis inspite of an impaired spindle assembly, relatively faster than control cells upon prolonged incubation in nocodazole, they were efficiently SAC-arrested after a 14-h nocodazole treatment. In Fcp1 overexpressing cells, adaptation was significantly accelerated when SAC was induced by taxol, a microtubule poison that affects spindle assembly by impairing microtubule depolymerization rather than polymerization like nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). That Fcp1-overexpressing cells adapted more rapidly under taxol rather than nocodazole may reflect the fact that either the two poisons have different potency in stimulating SAC, for instance in activating SAC effector proteins, or that Fcp1 action may be favoured by structural requirements including kinetochore-spindle pole microtubule-mediated connection, that form in rudimental spindles under taxol rather than nocodazole regimen. That Fcp1 was required to reverse the inhibitory effects of an activated SAC on MPF inactivation was also indicated by the finding that Fcp1-siRNA-treated cells were resistant to the SAC override induced by reversine, an inhibitor of the SAC kinase Mps1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p>

In addition, by coimmunoprecipitation experiments Fcp1 was shown to transiently interacted with Cdc27 shortly after release from nocodazole arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), and that p-T239-Wee1 dephosphorylation was prevented in cells depleted of Cdc27 by siRNAs, even after prolonged incubation following nocodazole release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Although lack of APC/C-dependent proteolysis may be rather indirectly required for Fcp1 action, our data suggest that the two functions are linked in a feedforward loop for exit from mitosis. Assays of total Fcp1 activity from cells before and after SAC resolution did not reveal significant changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Thus, either Fcp1 activity is constant and its substrate accessibility is regulated or activity of a small fraction of total Fcp1, localized at particular subcellular compartments, is regulated perhaps through an ubiquitination-proteolysis sensitive mechanism. Further work will be required to establish how Fcp1 action is precisely regulated. Nevertheless, in agreement with the idea that localized Fcp1 may be relevant for SAC inactivation and mitosis exit, recent observations indicated that Fcp1 localizes at centromeres in chromosomes isolated from mitotic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Moreover, analysing Fcp1 localization by indirect immunofluorescence in fixed mitotic cells, we found that Fcp1 was detectable at centrosomes in prometaphase, at spindle and spindle poles in metaphase and at spindle midzone and midbody in anaphase and telophase-G1, respectively, thus, regulation of spindle localized Fcp1 activity might be crucial for mitosis exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). In addition, Fcp1 localization also suggests that the phosphatase might have further roles in anaphase and cytokinesis. Some APC/C members have been shown to localize at spindle poles and at unattached kinetochores, where they could be bound to inhibitory SAC proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, whereas some SAC proteins have been show to relocalize from kinetochores to spindle poles upon bi-orientation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Fcp1 might be activated upon spindle assembly at spindle poles where, in turn, it may act to silence the SAC.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Together our data demonstrate a crucial role for Fcp1 phosphatase in the exit from mitosis. By targeting Cdc20 and USP44, Fcp1 appears to be required to reverse SAC-sustaining phosphorylations. At the same time, by targeting the cdk1 inhibitory kinase Wee1, Fcp1 reverses phosphorylation-dependent means of cdk1 inhibition, suggesting that, like in embryonic systems, this mechanism is an integral component of the somatic cell mitosis exit programme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Indeed, our preliminary data indicate that inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk1 affects cyclin degradation and correct anaphase execution in somatic human cells as well (RDM, LP, AP, RV and DG, unpublished results). Downstream cdk1 inactivation, PP1 and PP2A appear to be required for mitosis completion in vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus, these phosphatases are likely to take the upper hand and complete mitosis exit once cdk1 inactivation has begun in a Fcp1-dependent manner. Nevertheless, it is possible that Fcp1 action may begin cdk1 inactivation and, at the same time, promote the action of other phosphatase. In this regard, it will be interesting to investigate a possible relationship between Fcp1 and Greatwall kinase, a major kinase controlling PP2A activity in mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Although we do not know the precise mechanisms that regulate Fcp1 activity at M-phase exit, our data suggest that Fcp1 promotes SAC resolution by helping the SAC-silencing capacity of APC/C and reducing localized cdk1 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. During spindle assembly, an activatory relationship between APC/C and Fcp1 keeps resolving binding of activated SAC proteins to APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>; however, SAC proteins are continuously activated and reloaded onto APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> at unattached kinetochores. As chromosome attachment and bi-orientation proceeds SAC robustness weakens. This way, cdk1 inactivation and anaphase onset ensues once SAC proteins activation has dropped to a minimum upon bi-orientation of the last replicated chromosome. As Fcp1 also resets RNAP II at the end of mitosis to allow transcription resumption in daughter cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, our data suggest that the phosphatase has a crucial role in coordinating cell division with gene transcription.</p>
