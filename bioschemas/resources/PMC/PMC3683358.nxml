    <p id="P1">DNA damage activates a signaling network that blocks cell cycle progression, recruits DNA repair factors, and/or triggers senescence or programmed cell death.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Alterations in chromatin structure are implicated in the initiation and propagation of the DNA damage response (DDR).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> We further investigated the role of chromatin structure in the DDR by monitoring ionizing radiation-induced signaling and response events with a high-content multiplex RNAi screen of chromatin modifying and interacting genes. We discovered that an isoform of Brd4, a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of DDR signaling by recruiting the condensin II chromatin remodeling complex to acetylated histones via bromodomain interactions. Loss of this isoform results in relaxed chromatin structure, rapid cell cycle checkpoint recovery and enhanced survival post-irradiation, while functional gain of this isoform compacted chromatin, attenuated DDR signaling, and enhanced radiation-induced lethality. These data implicate Brd4, previously known for its role in transcriptional control, as an insulator of chromatin that can modulate the signaling response to DNA damage.</p>
    <p id="P2">Detection and repair of damaged DNA is integral for cell survival and accurate transmission of genetic information to progeny. Defects in the DDR contribute to oncogenesis and genomic instability in tumors<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and render tumor cells sensitive to DNA-damaging cancer therapy.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Early signaling events that trigger and transduce the DDR occur in the context of chromatin, and it is likely that modulation of chromatin structure plays a role in DDR signaling.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Histone proteins are known targets of DDR post-translational modification,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but a detailed understanding of the role of chromatin modulation in the DDR is lacking.</p>
    <p id="P3">To explore the role of chromatin modulation in the DDR, we developed a high-throughput, high-content quantitative microscopy assay multiplexed for early and late DDR endpoints, and applied this to an RNAi library focused on proteins that interact with and modify chromatin (see full Methods).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> For each time point, cells were co-stained with Î³H2AX antibodies to measure early signaling events in the DDR; Hoechst 33342 to monitor cell cycle progression; and phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) to measure mitotic entry. At the latest timepoint, cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) was substituted for pHH3 to measure apoptotic cell death. The screening assay was validated with small molecule inhibitors of DDR signaling as well as RNAi directed against known components of the DDR pathway (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 1â4</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">The most pronounced increase in Î³H2AX foci number, size and intensity following IR was observed at 1 and 6 hr after knockdown of Brd4; this remained elevated at 24 hr (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Eight hairpins directed against Brd4 showed this effect, making off-target effects unlikely (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Neither Brd4 knockdown in the absence of irradiation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) nor knockdown of other bromodomain-containing proteins (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) significantly altered Î³H2AX. Increased IR-induced Î³H2AX after Brd4 loss was further confirmed using siRNA oligonucleotides targeting additional independent Brd4 sequences (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Brd4 encodes 3 splice isoforms (A, B and C in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Each isoform contains two N-terminal bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) that bind acetylated lysine, and an extra-terminal (ET) domain recently reported to interact with several chromatin-binding proteins.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The A isoform contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) that functions as a transcriptional co-activator with the pTEFb complex.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> This region is notably absent in the B and C isoforms, and in the B isoform, it is replaced with a divergent short 75 amino acid segment. All three Brd4 isoforms are expressed in U2OS cells, and the shRNAs used in our initial screen targeted all three isoforms (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We confirmed that a single distinct siRNA that was active against all Brd4 isoforms replicated the Brd4 loss-of-function phenotype of elevated IR-induced Î³H2AX (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To establish the relative effects of the isoforms on the DDR, we performed gain-of-function experiments. Overexpression of Brd4 isoform B most potently suppressed IR-induced Î³H2AX foci (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We designed isoform-specific siRNAs to selectively reduce expression of isoform A or B mRNA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>); selective targeting of isoform C was not technically possible owing to complete coding sequence overlap with isoforms A and C. We observed that selective depletion of Brd4 isoform B, but not isoform A, increased H2AX phosphorylation over a wide range of ionizing radiation doses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">To investigate whether elevated Î³H2AX levels observed in Brd4-deficient cells resulted from increased production of IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or from faulty DSB repair, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to quantify DSBs in control and Brd4 knockdown cells. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, Brd4 knockdown had minimal effects on the generation and repair kinetics of DSBs. These observations, together with our finding that individual Î³H2AX foci were larger and more intense in irradiated Brd4 knockdown cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>,<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>), suggest that there is enhanced signaling from damaged DNA in the absence of Brd4, rather than an increase in the amount of damage or repair deficiency.</p>
    <p id="P8">Changes in overall chromatin structure can affect H2AX phosphorylation, likely by controlling the accessibility of signaling molecules to DNA damage sites.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Interestingly, Î³H2AX foci form more readily in âopenâ areas of euchromatin<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, histone acetylation has been linked to the âopenâ chromatin state, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are known to increase H2AX phosphorylation.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> We speculated that a bromodomain protein could influence H2AX phosphorylation via interaction with acetylated histones and effects on global chromatin structure, and therefore performed micrococcal nuclease susceptibility experiments. Knockdown of Brd4 isoform B increased digestion by micrococcal nuclease, indicating a more âopenâ overall chromatin structure, while knockdown of isoform A had minimal effects (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that cells transfected with Brd4 isoform B showed a distinct nuclear DAPI staining pattern, indicating a change in chromatin structure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>, quantification of the nuclear staining texture revealed a more heterogeneous DAPI intensity pattern, and significantly lower pixel-to-pixel correlation of DAPI staining in cells overexpressing isoform B, indicative of isoform B-mediated alterations in global chromatin structure. Expression of isoform A had no effect on DAPI staining, while overexpression of isoform C had smaller effects than those observed with isoform B.</p>
    <p id="P9">Our finding that Brd4 isoform B expression affects global chromatin structure and attenuates H2AX phosphorylation in response to DNA damage led us to investigate the subcellular localization of isoform B in response to ionizing radiation. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that ionizing radiation did not grossly alter Brd4 isoform B nuclear localization, which tightly mirrored DNA patterns revealed by DAPI staining (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, subcellular fractionation of U2OS cells and extraction of chromatin bound proteins demonstrated that irradiation caused enhanced isoform B association with the high salt-extractable chromatin fraction (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b,c</xref>), indicating increased association of isoform B with chromatin after DNA damage.</p>
    <p id="P10">Bromodomains recognize epigenetic marks on chromatin via binding to acetyl-lysine.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We therefore tested the contribution of Brd4 bromodomain interactions to alterations in Î³H2AX phosphorylation using JQ1, a small molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomains.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Only the active enantiomer of JQ1 caused increased H2AX phosphorylation following irradiation in U2OS cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), similar to the effects observed following Brd4 isoform-B specific knockdown. Furthermore, JQ1 treatment or Brd4 isoform B knock-down did not significantly alter total histone levels or levels of histone acetylation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 7,8</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of Brd4 isoform B led to alteration in the nuclear staining pattern of acetyl-lysine, closely mirroring the DAPI staining pattern induced by expression of isoform B (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">The concentration of JQ1 that we used (250 nM) is consistent with the reported <italic>in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub> for Brd4 bromodomains 1 (BD1, 77 nM) and 2 (BD2, 33 nM).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> To directly evaluate the role of each bromodomain in isoform B, we performed gain-of-function experiments using wild-type Brd4 in the absence or presence of JQ1, or constructs harboring mutations that abrogate acetyl lysine binding by BD1 or BD2. Mutations in BD1, or addition of the active enantiomer of JQ1, potently reversed the Î³H2AX-suppressive effects of isoform B expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). Notably, mutations that abrogate BD1 binding to acetyl-lysine also rescued the IR-induced cell death phenotype observed with Brd4 isoform B gain-of-function (see below), implicating BD1 in the mechanism of DNA damage inhibition (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">To further probe the role of lysine acetylation on Î³H2AX-Brd4 effects, we examined the combined effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors and Brd4 knockdown. We found that when Brd4 isoform B knockdown was combined with exposure to 50 nM LBH589, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1â3 and 6,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> H2AX phosphorylation was enhanced to a greater extent than with either treatment alone (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). This effect could be observed even in unirradiated cells, although the total level of H2AX phosphorylation remained lower than that seen in irradiated cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that Brd4 isoform B binding to acetylated regions of chromatin alters chromatin structure and limits H2AX phosphorylation.</p>
    <p id="P13">Brd4 also has a defined role in transcriptional modulation, largely via interactions of isoform A with the pTEFb transcriptional complex.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> To investigate the contribution of Brd4-driven transcriptional changes to the suppression of DNA damage signaling, we profiled mRNA expression patterns of cells stably expressing control or Brd4 shRNAs. Only one DDR-associated transcript, CHEK2, showed a differential expression change of 2-fold or more (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). Importantly, transient Brd4 knockdowns with siRNA, or short-term inhibition with JQ1, both of which increasedÎ³H2AX foci formation after irradiation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), caused no change in CHEK2 mRNA levels (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10b,c</xref>), and neither long-term nor short term Brd4 knockdown affected the protein levels of several DDR molecules, including Chk2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10d</xref>). Moreover, the suppression of DDR signaling by Brd4 isoform B overexpression was insensitive to transcription and translation inhibition with Î±-amanitin and cycloheximide, respectively (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P14">As interactions between Brd4 and other protein complexes involved in modulating chromatin structure were likely to be responsible for the DDR effects we observed, we identified proteins co-immunoprecipitated with isoform B after DNA damage using mass spectrometry (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). From two independent experiments, we obtained a common set of 57 interacting proteins (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3</xref>,<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>). Since the DDR-relevant Brd4-binding proteins presumably function in the same pathway as Brd4, we reasoned that loss of these proteins should show a phenotype similar to Brd4 loss-of-function. We therefore used our existing HCS screen data to create a list of the top quartile of genes ranked by increased Î³H2AX foci intensity, number, and size at 1 and 6 hr following irradiation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The overlap of this list with the list of isoform B interacting proteins revealed two members of the condensin II complex, SMC2 and CAPD3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). This finding was intriguing as the condensin II complex has a known role in chromatin compaction in both mitotic and interphase cells, and has been linked to DNA damage repair.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> We performed immunoprecipitation experiments after DNA damage, and found that the SMC2 and SMC4 components of the condensin II complex co-immunoprecipitated with Brd4 isoform B, while Brd4 isoform A had minimal co-association (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). To verify the role of this interaction on the Î³H2AX effects we observed, we performed combined isoform B and SMC2 knockdown and assayed H2AX phosphorylation 24 hr after siRNA transfection, when knockdown of each protein is sub-maximal. We found that H2AX phosphorylation was enhanced with combined knockdown over knockdown of either protein alone (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Furthermore, in cells overexpressing isoform B, SMC2 knockdown could abrogate the suppressive effects of Brd4 on Î³H2AX, demonstrating a functional interaction between isoform B and the condensin II complex in modulating Î³H2AX (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h,j</xref>). Finally, we noted that the effects of isoform B on the DAPI staining pattern of chromatin were abrogated by co-transfection of SMC2 siRNA, indicating that the Brd4-condensin II interaction is involved in chromatin structure alterations (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P15">We next investigated isoform B effects on other components of the DDR. We found that isoform B gain-of-function inhibited IR-induced foci formation of several additional known DDR signaling components including 53BP1, phosphorylated ATM, and multiple DDR signaling molecules containing the phospho-SQ DDR kinase substrate motif (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, overexpression of isoform B resulted in increased cell death following irradiation, an effect that was significantly diminished by mutation of BD1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The cell death observed in Brd4 isoform B overexpressing cells appears to result from mitotic catastrophe, consistent with a loss of DDR signaling that results in failed cell cycle arrest (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). We also investigated the effect of isoform B knockdown on DDR-induced cell cycle arrest and survival. Interestingly, isoform B loss-of-function allowed increased cell survival with more rapid and efficient recovery from cell-cycle arrest after irradiation, complementing the inverse findings observed with isoform B gain-of-function (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P16">Given the effects of Brd4 isoform B on IR-induced DDR signaling and survival, we hypothesized that isoform B might have a role in tumor responses to irradiation. We screened a panel of established cell lines from several human tumor types commonly treated with radiotherapy for Î³H2AX effects using the JQ1 inhibitor. Several cell types showed increased IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation with JQ1 treatment, including breast, prostate, and particularly glioma cancer cell lines (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Just as we had observed with U2OS cells, irradiation had the expected killing effect on DMSO-treated glioma cells, however, this killing effect was dramatically reduced in JQ1-treated glioma cells, consistent with our finding of increased DDR signaling and radioresistance with decreased Brd4 function (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of Brd4 isoform B in glioma cells inhibited H2AX phosphorylation, consistent with decreased DDR signaling upon Brd4 gain-of-function (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P17">We conclude that structural alterations in chromatin mediated by Brd4 acetyl lysine binding function to attenuate the DNA damage signaling response to IR. These effects on DDR signaling are consistent with the induction of a chromatin structure that is inhibitory to the formation of Î³H2AX in the case of higher levels of Brd4 isoform B expression, or a more âopenâ chromatin structure that facilitates Î³H2AX foci formation when Brd4 expression is reduced, or following pharmacological inhibition of bromodomain binding (shown schematically in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P18">Our data indicate that Brd4 affects DDR signaling via mechanisms distinct from known transcriptional interactions with the P-TEFb transcriptional complex. The relevant Brd4 isoform that modulates the DDR, isoform B, lacks the pTEFb-interacting region. In addition, chemical inhibition of transcription/translation had no effect on the ability of Brd4 to suppress DDR-induced Î³H2AX. This finding is in line with the recent identification of other chromatin-interacting proteins such as KAP-1 and Brg1 that have roles in DNA damage signaling that do not seem to arise directly from transcriptional activity that these molecules also possess.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Rather, the enhancement of multiple parameters of Î³H2AX foci following Brd4 knockdown, including their size, and intensity, in addition to their number, point to a role for Brd4 in limiting the propagation of DDR signaling following IR. This effect seems to involve the recruitment of a chromatin-condensing complex to sites of acetylation, a novel role for Brd4. In agreement with this, overexpression of Brd4 even in the absence of damage resulted in alterations of chromatin structure and nuclear acetylation patterns, consistent with a model of Brd4 isoform B binding to and occluding acetyl-lysine sites on chromatin and recruiting chromatin compaction machinery. These findings implicate bromodomain-mediated interactions in modulating specific chromatin structures that inhibit the propagation of DDR signaling in chromatin, <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and indicate that Brd4 isoform B alters the threshold response of Î³H2AX to DNA damage.</p>

        <p id="P33">Full-length constructs of Brd4-NUT (accession #AY166680.1), Brd4 Isoform A (accession # NM_058243), B (accession #BC035266) and C (accession #NM_014299.2) were cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) by PCR. Bromodomain mutations were introduced using quickchange (Stratagene) using PCR primers: 5â²-AAA TTG TTA CAT CGC CAA CAA GCC TGG AGA TGA CGC AGT CTT AAT GGC AG-3â² and 5â²-CTG CCA TTA AGA CTG CGT CAT CTC CAG GCT TGT TGG CGA TGT AAC AAT TT-3â². Cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche) according to manufacturerâs instructions. shRNA directed against Brd4 were from the TRC library (see <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), or created in the mir30-based pMLP vector (kind gift of Dr. Michael Hemann, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA) with primer 5â²-TGC TGT TGA CAG TGA GCG AAG ACA CA-3â² for Brd4. U2OS cell lines stably expressing this shRNA or control hairpins (ineffective hairpins directed against human sequences of BAD and PUMA) were created using puromycin selection at 2 Î¼g/mL. STEALTH siRNA against pan-isoform BRD4, SMC2, and control were purchased from Invitrogen. Custom Brd4 isoform-specific siRNA were synthesized from Dharmacon using the sequences: Isoform A specific 5â²-GGG AGA AAG AGG AGC GUG AUU-3â² and Isoform B specific 5â²-GCA CCA GUG GAG ACU UCG UUU-3â². siRNA against SMC2 was from Dharmacon. For siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to manufacturerâs instructions.</p>

        <p id="P34">Proteins from the Brd4 co-immunoprecipitation were examined after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by staining with Coomassie Blue. Gel bands were excised, de-stained and processed for digestion with trypsin (Promega; 12.5 ng/Î¼l in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.9). Peptides were loaded directly onto a column packed with C18 beads. The column was placed in-line with a tapered electrospray column packed with C18 beads on a Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were eluted using a 120-min gradient (0 to 70% acetonitrile in 0.2 M acetic acid; 50 nl/min). Data were collected using the mass spectrometer in data-dependent acquisition mode to collect tandem mass spectra and examined using Mascot software (Matrix Science).</p>
