        <p id="P1">Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is critical for tumor angiogenesis. However, therapies based on the inhibition of VEGF receptors have shown modest results in patients with cancer. Surprisingly little is known about mechanisms underlying the regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression, the main targets of these drugs. Here, analysis of tissue microarrays revealed an inversely reciprocal pattern of VEGF receptor regulation in the endothelium of human squamous cell carcinomas (high VEGFR1, low VEGFR2), as compared to the endothelium of control tissues (low VEGFR1, high VEGFR2). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that VEGF signals through the Akt/ERK pathway to inhibit constitutive ubiquitination and induce rapid VEGFR1 accumulation in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, VEGFR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of endothelial cells. In contrast, VEGF signals through the JNK/c-Jun pathway to induce endocytosis, nuclear translocation, and downregulation of VEGFR2 via ubiquitination. VEGFR1 signaling is required for endothelial cell survival, while VEGFR2 regulates capillary tube formation. Notably, the antiangiogenic effect of Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) requires the normalization of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in human squamous cell carcinomas vascularized with human blood vessels in immunodeficient mice. Collectively, this work demonstrate that VEGF-induced angiogenesis requires the inverse regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in tumor-associated endothelial cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of physiologic angiogenesis, and plays a major role in the pathobiology of cancer (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Lack of one <italic>vegf</italic> allele is sufficient to cause death early in embryonic development due to abnormal vessel development (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and autocrine VEGF signaling is required to maintain vascular homeostasis in adult healthy tissues (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The recognition of the prominent role for VEGF in cancer led to the development of antiangiogenic therapies targeting this pathway (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Indeed, these therapies have become standard of care for several malignancies, including metastatic colorectal cancer (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, resistance to antiangiogenic therapies has been described in xenograft tumor models and in clinical trials (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The understanding of mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of VEGF receptors is imperative to determine how vascular homeostasis is maintained in health and how these receptors contribute to the pathobiology of angiogenesis dependent diseases, such as cancer. Furthermore, the understanding of the cellular localization and regulation of these receptors in healthy tissues and in tumors is critical for the improvement of the outcomes of therapies targeted to the inhibition of VEGF signaling.</p>
      <p id="P3">The VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, are structurally related members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family that mediate critical signaling pathways in endothelial cells (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). VEGFR1 is a receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PlGF, and is believed to have low kinase activity (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In contrast, VEGFR2 is considered a highly active receptor that mediates broad signaling cascades and regulates many endothelial cell functions including proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Ligand-mediated degradation of RTKs is an important regulatory step of signaling transduction. It is known that epidermal growth factor (EGF) causes downregulation of EGFR by ubiquitination (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). VEGF dependent VEGFR2 downregulation appears to involve endocytosis in either bovine aortic endothelial cells or human endothelial cells (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Notably, autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of VEGFR2 is necessary for receptor internalization (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). While ligand-mediated downregulation of VEGFR2 has been described, mechanisms underlying the reciprocal upregulation of VEGFR1 in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF and the impact of this reversal of expression levels to endothelial cell proliferation, sprouting, survival, and tumor angiogenesis have not been characterized. In this study, we showed that VEGF-induced upregulation of VEGFR1 is dependent upon Akt and ERK signaling, while the downregulation of VEGFR2 is mediated by the JNK-c-Jun pathway. Gene silencing and functional studies demonstrated that VEGFR1 signaling is critical for endothelial cell survival, while VEGFR2 signaling is required for capillary tube formation. Notably, the anti-angiogenic effect of the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab <italic>in vivo</italic> correlates with the reversal of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 levels in the vascular endothelial cells of squamous cell carcinomas.</p>

        <title>VEGF reverses VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein levels in endothelial cells</title>
        <p id="P4">A tissue microarray containing a panel of human squamous cell carcinomas (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) was used to evaluate VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein levels in tumor-associated endothelial cells. We found more VEGFR1-positive blood vessels in human squamous cell carcinomas than in control tissues, <italic>i.e.</italic> oral mucosa (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a and b</xref>). In contrast, VEGFR2-positive vessels were more prevalent in oral mucosa than within the tumor environment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Notably, while in human tumors the majority of blood vessels are VEGFR1-positive, in the oral mucosa most vessels are VEGFR2-positive (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). As expected, human squamous cell carcinomas strongly express VEGF (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). To evaluate the spatial relationship between VEGF receptor expression and VEGF, we performed immunostaining of serial and sequential tissue sections from xenografted human squamous cell carcinomas grown in SCID mice. Confirming the data from the tissue microarrays, we observed strong immunostaining for VEGF and VEGFR1, and weaker staining for VEGFR2 in the xenograft tumors (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). To begin to understand mechanisms involved in the regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression, we exposed primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) to increasing concentrations of fetal bovine serum (FBS). While FBS downregulated VEGFR2, it potently induced VEGFR1 in HDMEC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Knowing that ligands exert regulatory functions on their own receptors, that FBS contains VEGF, and that human squamous cell carcinomas express high levels of VEGF, we evaluated the effect of recombinant VEGF on the regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. VEGF induced expression of VEGFR1 while downregulating VEGFR2 in two primary endothelial cell types, <italic>i.e.</italic> HDMEC and human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Treatment with anti-VEGF antibody inhibited VEGF-regulatory effects on VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating specificity of responses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). To further verify the specificity of VEGF receptor regulation, we evaluated the effect of EGF, which is known to downregulate its tyrosine kinase receptor (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). EGF downregulated EGFR in squamous cell carcinoma cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>), but had no effect on the expression levels of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in endothelial cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f and h</xref>). Likewise, the VEGF receptor ligand placental growth factor (PlGF), and the angiogenic cytokine IL-6 (Interleukin-6), had no effect on VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f and i</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P5">The reversal of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein levels in endothelial cells happened within minutes of exposure to VEGF (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>), which suggested that this process was not regulated at the transcriptional level. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses confirmed this hypothesis showing that VEGF had no effect on VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 mRNA within the same timeframe (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a and b</xref>). We then reasoned that intracellular receptor trafficking and differential regulation of ubiquitination might be involved in the process of VEGF-induced regulation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Confocal microscopy showed that VEGFR2 is translocated to the nucleus within 30 minutes of VEGF treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Surprisingly, most of the VEGFR1 is found in the nucleus of untreated or VEGF-treated HDMEC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Cell fractionation studies confirmed that VEGFR1 is mainly expressed in the nucleus, while VEGFR2 is in the cytoplasmic/cell membrane fraction in untreated cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). VEGFR1 remained in the nucleus upon treatment with VEGF, while VEGFR2 translocated from the cytoplasmic/cell membrane fraction to the nucleus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). EGF and IL-6 did not affect VEGFR2 localization (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). Treatment with Concanavalin-A revealed that VEGF-induced VEGFR2 nuclear translocation depends on endocytosis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). However, blockade of nuclear translocation did not prevent VEGF-induced VEGFR2 downregulation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). Interestingly, only the high molecular weight VEGFR2 isoform translocated into the nucleus upon treatment with VEGF (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d-g</xref>). To determine the glycosylation state of the VEGFR2 isoform translocated to the nucleus, we treated cell lysates with an enzymatic cocktail that eliminates all N-linked and most O-linked forms. Interestingly, we observed that both VEGFR2 isoforms are glycosylated (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting that the nuclear translocation is not differentially regulated by VEGFR2's glycosylation.</p>

        <title>VEGF-induced VEGFR2 downregulation requires signaling through the JNK-c-Jun pathway and activity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system</title>
        <p id="P6">To evaluate the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system on VEGF-induced VEGFR2 downregulation, HDMEC were exposed to VEGF in presence of specific inhibitors. We observed that inhibition of ubiquitin or proteasome activity partially prevented VEGF-induced VEGFR2 downregulation, but not nuclear translocation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a and b</xref>). It is known that JNK targets ubiquitination of regulatory proteins (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). HDMEC exposed to VEGF showed strong phosphorylation of JNK-2, and to some extent JNK-1, resulting in c-Jun activation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Notably, phosphorylation of JNK correlated with a marked decrease in VEGFR2 protein levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Indeed, blockade of JNK activity inhibited VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 downregulation and partially blocked VEGFR1 upregulation in HDMEC and HPEC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e and f</xref>). However, inhibition of JNK activity did not affect VEGF-induced VEGFR2 nuclear translocation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>). We also evaluated two additional means of directly inducing JNK activity, UV radiation and Anisomycin (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Both strategies were sufficient to downregulate VEGFR2 protein levels in endothelial cells, bypassing the requirement for VEGF (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2a and b</xref>). Of note, blockade of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation with SP600125 prevented Anisomycin-induced downregulation of VEGFR2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrated that signaling through the JNK/c-Jun pathway and activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system are necessary for VEGF-induced downregulation of VEGFR2 protein levels in primary endothelial cells.</p>

        <title>VEGF signals through PI3k-Akt to inhibit ubiquitination and rapidly increase VEGFR1 levels in endothelial cells</title>
        <p id="P7">Since VEGFR1 expression was upregulated within minutes of exposure to VEGF, we hypothesized that VEGFR1 was continuously being degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system to maintain its homeostatic levels. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that inhibition of either ubiquitin or proteasome activity was sufficient to rapidly induce VEGFR1 expression (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h and i</xref>). Then, we evaluated the function of the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways in VEGF-induced VEGFR1 expression in HDMEC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3j-l</xref>). Inhibition of either Akt or ERK1/2 phosphorylation suppressed VEGF-mediated VEGFR1 upregulation, but had no effect on VEGFR2 protein levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3k and l</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="S6">
        <title>VEGFR1 signaling is required for the anti-apoptotic effect of VEGF, while VEGFR2 signaling is required for VEGF-induced capillary tube formation</title>
        <p id="P8">It is known that VEGF protects endothelial cells against apoptosis induced by growth factor starvation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To evaluate the relative role of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in endothelial cell survival, we used shRNA-mediated gene silencing with lentiviral vectors (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Unexpectedly, shRNA-mediated downregulation of VEGFR2 resulted in upregulation of VEGFR1 protein levels, while downregulation of VEGFR1 did not affect VEGFR2 protein (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). VEGFR1 knockdown had a stronger impact on endothelial cell density than VEGFR2 silencing (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). These findings correlated with a 2-3-fold increase in apoptosis of serum-starved VEGFR1-knockdown endothelial cells, while VEGFR2 knockdown had no effect on cell survival (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). To confirm these data using a second apoptotic assay, we analyzed activity of the effector of apoptosis caspase-3 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f and g</xref>). We observed that VEGFR1, but not VEGFR2, knockdown is sufficient to enhance caspase-3 activity in starved endothelial cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f and g</xref>). Knockdown of either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 did not have any effect on endothelial cell cycle (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>). Notably, with complete endothelial cell medium (5% FBS), we observed a decrease in capillary tube formation only when VEGFR2 expression was knockdown in endothelial cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h and i</xref>). However, under a low serum concentration (2.5%), downregulation of either receptor led to a significant inhibition of capillary tube formation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h and i</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that while VEGFR1 signaling primarily regulates endothelial cell survival, VEGFR2 signaling is involved in vascular differentiation and capillary-like tube formation.</p>
        <p id="P9">VEGF was shown to enhance endothelial cell survival by inducing expression of Bcl-2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We observed that VEGFR1 signaling is required for VEGF-induced upregulation of Bcl-2 expression in endothelial cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). Surprisingly, VEGFR2 knockdown correlated with baseline increase in Bcl-2 expression and c-Jun phosphorylation in unstimulated endothelial cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c and d</xref>). However, VEGF does not induce Bcl-2 or phospho-c-Jun levels above baseline in VEGFR2-knockdown HDMEC (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c and d</xref>). JNK-c-Jun signaling is known to control expression of proteins involved in the regulation of cell survival (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Here, we observed that blockade of c-Jun phosphorylation inhibited VEGF-induced Bcl-2 expression, survival, and the angiogenic potential of HDMEC (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e-g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">It is known that STAT3, Akt, and ERK mediate survival and differentiation signals in endothelial cells (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We observed that the basal levels of phosphorylation of STAT3 and Akt are reduced in VEGFR1 knockdown endothelial cells, but not in VEGFR2 knockdown cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h and i</xref>). Notably, VEGF's ability to induce Akt phosphorylation involves signaling through VEGFR1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref>). VEGFR1 knockdown (but not VEGFR2) increased the basal levels of phosphorylated ERK (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref>). VEGFR1 knockdown further enhanced the induction of ERK phosphorylation in response to a 15-minute exposure to VEGF, as compared with vector control endothelial cells treated with VEGF (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref>). However, the level of ERK phosphorylation in response to VEGF in VEGFR2 knockdown cells was similar (shRNA-VEGFR2a), or lower (shRNA-VEGFR2b), than in control cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>). Knockdown of either VEGFR1 (data not shown) or VEGFR2 had no effect on EGF-mediated signaling, confirming the specificity of the responses to VEGF (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5j</xref>). Functional assays revealed that PI3K/Akt signaling is required for capillary tube formation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). STAT3 inhibition mediated similar effects, but the decrease in the number of capillary tubes was not as pronounced. In contrast, blockade of ERK1/2 signaling inhibited capillary tube formation without a comparable decrease in cell number (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Together, these data demonstrated that VEGFR1 signaling is involved in the regulation of STAT3 and Akt homeostatic activity, which have been shown to be required for endothelial cell survival (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P13">The understanding of mechanisms underlying VEGF signaling has become critically important in recent years due to the increasing use of therapeutic inhibitors of this pathway for the treatment of cancer. It has become evident that while some patients benefit from such therapy, a significant subset of patients is refractory to treatment. This might be due to the development of evasive resistance to VEGF inhibition by âturning onâ alternative angiogenic pathways, or by enhancing recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In both cases, the activity and regulation of VEGF receptor signaling pathways play a critical role.</p>
      <p id="P14">We observed that recombinant human VEGF, FBS, or conditioned medium from VEGF-expressing tumor cell lines induce a ârheostat-likeâ pattern of regulation of VEGF receptors, enhancing VEGFR1 while decreasing VEGFR2 protein levels in primary endothelial cells. Notably, the sub-cellular distribution of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 is fundamentally different. Our studies demonstrate that VEGFR1 is found primarily in the nucleus and does not move from there upon stimulation with VEGF. Of note, a recent study demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy the presence of VEGFR1 in the Golgi of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The data presented here does not exclude the possibility that some VEGFR1 can be found in the cytoplasmic fraction of HDMEC. However, our cell fractionation and confocal microscopy studies demonstrated unequivocally that the majority of VEGFR1 is present in the nucleus. In contrast, VEGFR2 clearly changes location from the cell membrane/cytoplasmic fraction to the nucleus when endothelial cells are treated with VEGF. Western blots for VEGFR2 typically show two bands (representing two isoforms) in unstimulated endothelial cells. However, upon stimulation with VEGF we observed that only the larger isoform is translocated to the nucleus. The most significant decrease in expression mediated by VEGF is observed with the larger isoform, through mechanisms that are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Notably, blockade of endocytosis prevented VEGF-induced nuclear translocation of VEGFR2, but did not prevent its downregulation. In contrast, inhibition of the ubiquitin/proteasome system prevented VEGF-induced VEGFR2 downregulation, but did not prevent nuclear translocation. These data suggest that the processes of nuclear translocation and VEGFR2 downregulation are mechanistically independent.</p>
      <p id="P15">It is known that JNK targets the ubiquitination of regulatory proteins, including ATF2 (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We observed here that VEGF induced potent activation of the JNK-c-Jun pathway, and that JNK activity is associated with ubiquitination of VEGFR2. On the other hand, inhibition of the ubiquitin or proteasome activity is sufficient to enhance expression of VEGFR1 in primary endothelial cells. These findings suggest that endothelial cells are continuously synthesizing VEGFR1 and that ubiquitin/proteasome activity is necessary to maintain its homeostatic levels. Notably, the regulation of VEGFR1 protein levels is dependent on Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Since these two kinases typically inhibit the degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin/proteasome system, we postulate that VEGF induces phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, which in turn prevents the degradation of VEGFR1 by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Collectively, these data suggest that VEGF orchestrates an intricate process mediated by the Akt/ERK and JNK/c-Jun that protects VEGFR1 while âtaggingâ VEGFR2 for degradation, leading to rapid reversal of the protein levels of these two receptors. We propose that this mechanism is involved in the well-characterized ability of the vascular endothelium to quickly adapt to sudden changes in the microenvironment.</p>
      <p id="P16">We and other colleagues have reported that VEGF enhances the survival of endothelial cells by regulating the activity of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and inhibiting caspase-mediated cell death (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). At that time, it was believed that this process was mediated by VEGFR2 signaling. The availability of specific shRNA constructs to selectively downregulate expression of each VEGF receptor allowed us to revisit these data. We demonstrate here that endothelial cell survival is regulated primarily by VEGFR1 signaling, while VEGFR2 signaling regulates the differentiation of endothelial cells into capillary tubes.</p>
      <p id="P17">Our ability to discriminate the function of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 <italic>in vivo</italic> is hindered by the fact that both receptors play critical and complementary roles in angiogenesis (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, in attempt to validate the concepts tested here within relevant tumor models, we exposed the endothelial cells to the conditioned medium of VEGF-producing squamous cell carcinomas. As expected, the tumor cells enhanced the survival and angiogenic potential of endothelial cells. This was correlated with an increase in the expression of VEGFR1, Bcl-2 and phospho-c-Jun, which is consistent with the increase in the survival typically observed in tumor-associated endothelial cells (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P18">The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis mediated by VEGF signaling blockade with bevacizumab correlated with a reversal in VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein levels. These data raise the intriguing hypothesis that the anti-tumor effect of anti-VEGF therapies requires the normalization of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 protein levels. This work suggests that the process of normalization of VEGFR1/VEGFR2 can potentially constitute a novel conceptual target for cancer treatment. Moreover, the reversal of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 can potentially be useful as a molecular biomarker for the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapies.</p>
      <p id="P19">Collectively, our studies demonstrated that VEGFR1 is the dominant receptor in the tumor microenvironment, and that VEGFR1 is required for endothelial cell survival. These findings support the concept that VEGFR1 is the preferable therapeutic target in cancer. However, the unexpected finding that this receptor is localized in the nucleus of angiogenic endothelial cells suggests that highly permeable drugs are required to achieve clinically relevant inhibition of VEGFR1 signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, this work revealed a novel mechanism by which a ligand inversely regulates two receptors to promote angiogenesis. Inversely reciprocal regulation of receptors by a single ligand might be a common mechanism shared by cells to regulate the function of other ligand/receptor systems in physiology and in disease.</p>
