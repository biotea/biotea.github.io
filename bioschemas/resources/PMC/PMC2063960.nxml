      <abstract>
        <p>Assembly of E-cadherinâbased adherens junctions (AJ) is obligatory for establishment of polarized epithelia and plays a key role in repressing the invasiveness of many carcinomas. Here we show that type IÎ³ phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIÎ³) directly binds to E-cadherin and modulates E-cadherin trafficking. PIPKIÎ³ also interacts with the Î¼ subunits of clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes and acts as a signalling scaffold that links AP complexes to E-cadherin. Depletion of PIPKIÎ³ or disruption of PIPKIÎ³ binding to either E-cadherin or AP complexes results in defects in E-cadherin transport and blocks AJ assembly. An E-cadherin germline mutation that loses PIPKIÎ³ binding and shows disrupted basolateral membrane targeting no longer forms AJs and leads to hereditary gastric cancers. These combined results reveal a novel mechanism where PIPKIÎ³ serves as both a scaffold, which links E-cadherin to AP complexes and the trafficking machinery, and a regulator of trafficking events via the spatial generation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tight junctions, adherens junctions (AJs), and desmosomes promote adhesion between epithelial cells, initiate the assembly of the mechanical cytoskeleton linkage, and facilitate the formation of a polarized epithelial monolayer (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gumbiner, 1996</xref>). AJs initiate these processes and are essential for morphogenesis, wound healing, and the retention of cell polarity and tissue integrity (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Moreno et al., 2003</xref>). In epithelia, AJ formation is mediated by the calcium-dependent homophilic binding of E-cadherin molecules on neighboring cells (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gumbiner, 1996</xref>). These interactions link adjacent cells and promote the nucleation of a cytoplasmic protein complex consisting of p120-, Î²-, and Î±-catenins, which bridges E-cadherin clusters and the actin cytoskeleton. The biological necessity of AJ proteins has been underscored by a high correlation between the malfunctioning of AJ proteins, E-cadherin in particular, and tumor metastasis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Massague, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>During tumor progression, the E-cadherin gene can be functionally silenced or inactivated by distinct mechanisms (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nelson and Nusse, 2004</xref>). In addition to transcriptional repression by SIP-1, Î´EF-1, Snail/Slug, E12/47, and Twist (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Huber et al., 2005</xref>), posttranslational regulation of E-cadherin stability modulates its activity. Precisely tuned exocytic and endocytic pathways control the amount of E-cadherin residing on the plasma membrane (PM) and are important for modulation of E-cadherin function and AJ assembly (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bryant and Stow, 2004</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that Rab11 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lock and Stow, 2005</xref>), p120-catenin, ARF6, tyrosine phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>) all control the trafficking and assembly of E-cadherin in mammalian cells. Additionally, transport of E-cadherin is regulated by the composition of the cadherinâcatenin complex as well as the vesicular trafficking machinery (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>), where multiple adaptor and signaling proteins orchestrate trafficking specificity and efficiency.</p>
      <p>Clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes are important in the sorting of cargoes containing dileucine or tyrosine-based sorting motifs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>). In epithelial cells, AP1B is the unique isoform that mediates basolateral transport (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Folsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). Although AP1B is closely related to the more ubiquitously expressed form of AP1, AP1A, it targets to a distinct membrane compartment defined as the recycling endosome (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Folsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that this compartment is an intermediary in transport from the Golgi to the PM (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ang et al., 2004</xref>) and also functions in the recycling of internalized basolateral membrane proteins (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Phosphoinositides are key mediators of membrane trafficking (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Roth, 2004</xref>). Membrane assembly and cargo binding of AP2 are both dependent on binding to phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) via its Î± and Î¼ subunits (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Honing et al., 2005</xref>). There is evidence that other AP complexes are also modulated by phosphoinositide lipid messengers (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Baust et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> regulates actin polymerization, focal adhesion assembly, and several components of the vesicular trafficking machinery (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Doughman et al., 2003</xref>). However, the mechanism by which PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation is regulated to mediate these trafficking events has not been defined.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have unveiled that the spatial targeting and temporal regulation of type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKIs) is a critical mechanism for PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>). Here we show that in epithelial cells PIPKIÎ³ targets to AJs by a direct interaction with the E-cadherin dimer. PIPKIÎ³ regulates E-cadherin trafficking by acting as a scaffold between E-cadherin and AP complexes. We also demonstrate that localized generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> via these complexes is necessary for E-cadherin transport and AJ formation.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³ interacts with cadherins</title>
        <p>Upon examination of the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells, we found that PIPKIÎ³ colocalized with E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) but not with occludin (not depicted). PIPKIÎ³ also presented in a cytosolic vesicular compartment and partially colocalized with E-cadherin at this site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrows). These regions of colocalizion were confirmed by constructing vertical sections of z-series images shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, suggesting an interaction between PIPKIÎ³ and a component of AJs. To examine this possibility, E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³ were immunoprecipitated. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, PIPKIÎ³ and E-cadherin associate in vivo, along with other cadherin-associated proteins, demonstrating that PIPKIÎ³ associates with E-cadherin complexes. N-cadherin and VE-cadherin also associate with PIPKIÎ³ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that PIPKIÎ³ associates with the classical cadherin complexes.</p>

        <p>PIPKIÎ³ is predominantly expressed as two distinct splice variants, PIPKIÎ³635 and PIPKIÎ³661, which differ by a 26âamino acid C-terminal extension. HA-tagged PIPKIÎ³ splice variants were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and their association with the endogenous N-cadherin complex was analyzed. PIPKIÎ³635 and PIPKIÎ³661 both coimmunoprecipitated with N-cadherin indistinguishably (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that this association does not depend on the PIPKIÎ³661 C-terminal extension. However, the endogenous PIPKIÎ³ associated with E-cadherin was indistinguishable in apparent molecular weight from PIPKIÎ³661, which is the predominant splice variant expressed in these cells. To ascertain whether this association was direct, in vitro GST pull-down assays were performed using recombinant GST-tagged PIPKIÎ³ and His-tagged E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (ECDT). ECDT showed specific binding to both GST-PIPKIÎ³635 and GST-PIPKIÎ³661, but not to GST alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or GST-PIPKIÎ± (Fig. S1 B).</p>
        <p>E-cadherin molecules form lateral homodimers in vivo, and oligomer formation is critical for AJ assembly and stability (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2003</xref>). Consequently, we examined if dimerization was important for association with PIPKIÎ³. A parallel dimeric ECDT was constructed by inserting a heptad repeat (HR) peptide sequence between the His tag and ECDT (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>; Fig. S1, C and D). The dimeric construct had a greater binding affinity for PIPKIÎ³ compared with the monomeric protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This was not caused by the HR tag because an HR-fused integrin cytoplasmic domain did not bind PIPKIÎ³ (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>; Fig. S1 E). Moreover, when expressed in cells, the Myc-tagged dimeric ECDT (Myc-HR-ECDT) selectively bound PIPKIÎ³ and p120-catenin with â¼10-fold greater affinity compared with the monomer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1 F). Consistent with a previous paper (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Huber et al., 2005</xref>), Î²-catenin bound the monomeric and dimeric E-cadherin C terminus with the same affinity.</p>
        <p>To further determine whether PIPKIÎ³ binding to E-cadherin involves other AJ components, wild-type or mutated E-cadherin was expressed in HEK293 cells and assessed for endogenous PIPKIÎ³ association (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Elimination of either the p120-catenin (ECDÎp120; <sup>762</sup>EED<sup>764</sup> to AAA) or Î²-catenin (ECDÎÎ²ctn; ECD847, deletion of the last 35 amino acids) binding sites had no effect on PIPKIÎ³ association. A chimera of truncated E-cadherin (deletion of the last 70 amino acids) fused to a truncated Î±-catenin that lacks the Î²-catenin binding site (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Imamura et al., 1999</xref>) abrogated both Î²-catenin (not depicted) and PIPKIÎ³ binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). These results indicate that PIPKIÎ³ binding to E-cadherin is independent of Î±-, Î²-, or p120-catenin and narrowed the PIPKIÎ³ interaction region on E-cadherin to residues 837â847. To confirm this putative PIPKIÎ³ binding site, the last 45 amino acids of E-cadherin were truncated (ECD836). This truncation resulted in ablation of both Î²-catenin and PIPKIÎ³ binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These combined data demonstrate that PIPKIÎ³ directly interacts within a region including amino acids 837â847 of E-cadherin that is a highly conserved domain in the type I classical cadherins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p>

        <p>To examine whether PIPKIÎ³ modulates E-cadherin function through this direct interaction, we introduced wild-type or p120/Î²-catenin binding siteâdeleted Myc-HR-ECDT into MDCK cells to compete with endogenous E-cadherin for PIPKIÎ³ binding (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1</ext-link>). Expression of dimeric ECDT that specifically binds PIPKIÎ³ resulted in a loss of AJs identified by E-cadherin staining and a cytosolic accumulation of PIPKIÎ³ in cells, indicating that this phenotype is likely caused by sequestration of PIPKIÎ³ (Fig. S2 B). Overexpression of PIPKIÎ³661 was sufficient to rescue the loss-of-AJ phenotype induced by wild-type Myc-HR-ECDT expression (Fig. S2 C). These data establish that a specific interaction between PIPKIÎ³ and E-cadherin plays a key role in E-cadherin function and appears to be a limiting factor in AJ formation.</p>

        <p>To further determine the functional role of PIPKIÎ³ at AJs, we knocked down endogenous PIPKIÎ³ expression using siRNAs. Although the cellular E-cadherin content was not changed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), loss of PIPKIÎ³ caused a striking loss of E-cadherin from the PM with an apparent accumulation in a cytoplasmic compartment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Upon loss of PM E-cadherin, the cells spread (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and underwent a morphological transition from a polarized epithelial to a more migratory mesenchymal- like phenotype (Fig. S2 D), supporting the requirement for PIPKIÎ³ in E-cadherinâmediated AJs assembly.</p>

<bold>PIPKIÎ³ is required for E-cadherin assembly and trafficking.</bold> (A) MDCK cells were treated with scrambled (Scram.) or PIPKIÎ³-specific siRNA (PIPKIÎ³1). PIPKIÎ³ (green) and ECD (red) were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Bars, 10 Î¼m.

The intensity ratio was plotted using SigmaPlot 8.0. Error bars are Â± SEM. (C) PIPKIÎ³ and E-cadherin protein levels in cells treated with scrambled (Scram.) or PIPKIÎ³-specific siRNAs (PIPKIÎ³1 and PIPKIÎ³2) were shown by immunoblots. (D) Protein levels of endogenous and inducibly overexpressed PIPKIÎ³661wild type (IÎ³661WT) or knock down (IÎ³661KD) in stable MDCK lines were determined. Actin was used as a loading control.

        <p>In addition, MDCK stable cell lines were generated that inducibly express HA-tagged wild-type (PIPKIÎ³661WT) or kinase-dead PIPKIÎ³661 (PIPKIÎ³661KD), the major endogenous PIPKIÎ³ isoform associated with cadherins (Fig. S1 A). Expression of PIPKIÎ³661WT or PIPKIÎ³661KD was induced by removing doxycyclin from the growth media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). As shown in Fig. S3 A (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1</ext-link>), upon PIPKIÎ³661KD expression, both E-cadherin PM targeting and AJ assembly appeared defective compared with parental or PIPKIÎ³661WT-expressing cells (Fig. S3 A). These cells formed E-cadherinâmediated cellâcell contacts much more slowly then parental cells when maintained at confluence (Fig. S3 A, 72 vs. 16 h). These observations are consistent with a dominant-negative effect for PIPKIÎ³661KD and also establish a requirement for PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation in AJ assembly.</p>
        <p>Our combined results demonstrate a highly specific role for PIPKIÎ³ in the assembly of E-cadherinâbased AJs, possibly by modulating the trafficking of E-cadherin. It has been shown that depletion of extracellular calcium by EGTA results in a loss of E-cadherin homoligation, internalization of E-cadherin, disassembly of AJs, and cell scattering (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chitaev and Troyanovsky, 1998</xref>). To explore possible modulation of E-cadherin trafficking by PIPKIÎ³, the exocytic and endocytic trafficking of E-cadherin was quantified in parental, PIPKIÎ³661WT-, and PIPKIÎ³661KD-expressing MDCK cells.</p>

However, when PIPKIÎ³ was overexpressed, Î³-adaptin association was weak; whereas in the reverse immunoprecipitation, association of PIPKIÎ³ was readily detected. This could result from the competition of other PIPKIÎ³ binding partners or from the sensitivity of the antiâÎ³-adaptin antibody.

        <p>To quantify internalization, cell surface E-cadherin was biotinylated, followed by extracellular calcium removal to induce E-cadherin internalization. Shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>, PIPKIÎ³661WT expression considerably enhanced, whereas PIPKIÎ³661KD expression inhibited, E-cadherin internalization when compared with parental cells. These data indicate that E-cadherin endocytosis is dependent on PIPKIÎ³661 kinase activity and PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation. E-cadherin internalization can be reversed upon replenishment of calcium, providing a method to assess the role of PIPKIÎ³ in recycling E-cadherin back to the PM. Compared with parental cells, recycling of E-cadherin was accelerated when PIPKIÎ³661WT was expressed, whereas PIPKIÎ³661KD blocked PM deposition of E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining experiments supported these results, as cells overexpressing PIPKIÎ³661WT had a dramatically faster rate of E-cadherin internalization and also showed an accumulation of both E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³ in an intracellular compartment (Fig. S3 B). In contrast, overexpression of PIPKIÎ³661KD significantly slowed the internalization of E-cadherin (Fig. S3 B).</p>
        <p>PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> regulates multiple events, including actin reorganization, that could affect E-cadherin assembly and AJ formation. Because changes in PIPKIÎ³ expression levels may alter global PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> levels and induce nonspecific responses, cellular PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> was quantified by HPLC analysis (Fig. S4, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200606023/DC1</ext-link>). No considerable changes in global cellular PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> levels were observed when PIPKIÎ³ expression levels or activity was altered. The overall structure of the actin cytoskeleton also showed no substantial change between PIPKIÎ³661WT- or KD-overexpressing cells and control cells (unpublished data). Upon depletion of PIPKIÎ³, cells exhibited an increase in actin stress fibers and prominent membrane ruffles, indicating a morphological transition from a polarized epithelial to migratory phenotype (unpublished data). Further effort was made to observe localized changes in PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> levels via a bead-based adhesion assay using latex beads coated with recombinant E-cadherin ectodomain (hE/Fc). As shown in Fig. S4 C, both E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³661 assembled on the surface of the hE/Fc-coated beads but not the poly-lysineâcoated control beads, demonstrating that PIPKIÎ³661 was recruited to the nascent AJs. Although our previous data indicate that PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> is necessary for E-cadherin assembly, the level of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> detected by the pleckstrin homology domain along the hE/Fc-coated bead surface was similar to the surrounding PM signal (Fig. S4 D), supporting the hypothesis that local PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> levels are sufficient to regulate E-cadherin assembly.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³ links E-cadherin to AP complexes</title>
        <p>Multiple components of the trafficking machinery, including the AP complexes, bind to and are regulated by PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Roth, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>). A yeast two-hybrid screen using the C terminus of PIPKIÎ³661 as bait identified interactions with the Î¼ subunits of both AP1B (Î¼1Î²; amino acids 135â423) and AP2 (Î¼2; full length). This was an exciting observation as the Î¼ subunits are key regulatory subunits of the AP complexes (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). The direct interaction of PIPKIÎ³661 with Î¼1Î² was confirmed by direct binding of purified components (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, left), and the in vivo association was established by coimmunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, right). PIPKIÎ³635 did not interact with either Î¼ subunit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that the last 26 residues of PIPKIÎ³661 are required. In addition, in vitro binding of Î¼1Î²-adaptin stimulated the kinase activity of PIPKIÎ³661 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), whereas binding of the soluble ECDT (His-HR-ECDT) had no effect on PIPKIÎ³661 activity under these conditions (not depicted).</p>
        <p>Epithelial cells typically express two variants of the AP1 complex, AP1A and AP1B. These AP1 complexes differ only in their Î¼ subunits, Î¼1Î± and Î¼1Î², which are almost 80% identical but target to distinct membrane compartments and have distinct functions (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). To further define the interaction between PIPKIÎ³ and the AP1 complexes, we examined the interaction between PIPKIÎ³ and both Î¼1Î± and Î¼1Î² in parallel experiments. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref> (left), PIPKIÎ³661 binds to Î¼1Î± and Î¼1Î² indistinguishably in vitro. The primary binding site of the Î¼ subunits is in the last 26 amino acids of PIPKIÎ³661 because the C terminus of PIPKIÎ³661 but not PIPKIÎ³635 bound the Î¼ subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). A weak interaction between full-length PIPKIÎ³635 and the Î¼ subunits was observed under less rigorous GST pull-down conditions, where detergent and BSA concentrations were decreased. This may be consistent with the observations by <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al. (2006)</xref>, which indicate that there may be a secondary Î¼ subunit binding site in the kinase domain of the PIPKIs. However, in vivo the interaction is specific for PIPKIÎ³661 and only the interaction between Î¼1Î² subunit (AP1B) and PIPKIÎ³661 was detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, right). The in vivo specificity of PIPKIÎ³661 for Î¼1Î² may be regulated by targeting to AP1B-positive membrane compartments via an interaction with other trafficking components, or the PIPKIÎ³661âAP1B interaction maybe specifically regulated by other mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Endogenous E-cadherin associates with the PIPKIÎ³âAP1 complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This association was disrupted by internalization of E-cadherin triggered by extracellular calcium depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). When calcium was restored and E-cadherin recycling to the PM was triggered, E-cadherin reassembled into the PIPKIÎ³âAP1 complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). To further examine the interactions between E-cadherin, PIPKIÎ³661, and AP1, GST pull-down assays were performed. Although there is no direct interaction between the Î¼1Î² subunit of AP1 and HR-ECDT, PIPKIÎ³661 was sufficient to link HR-ECDT to Î¼1Î² in a GST pulldown experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). PIPKIÎ³661 contains a YxxÏ sorting motif (<sup>644</sup>YSPL<sup>647</sup>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>). The substitution of the tyrosine with phenylalanine in the sorting motif was reported to reduce binding to the Î¼ subunits (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ohno et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aikawa and Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>).

        <p>Because AP complexes play an important role in protein transport, our data suggest that PIPKIÎ³661 regulates E-cadherin trafficking via a direct interaction with and regulation of AP complexes. Such a model would require AP1B for E-cadherin transport to the PM. To address this hypothesis, we used LLC-PK1 cells, which do not express Î¼1Î² (i.e., are AP1B deficient). In LLC-PK1 cells, many basolateral proteins are mistargeted and cell polarity is disrupted (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Folsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). To assess the role of Î¼1Î² in E-cadherin transport, GFPâE-cadherin was expressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). A small fraction of GFPâE-cadherin was able to translocate to the PM; however, the majority was observed in a perinuclear compartment, indicating inefficient transport of E-cadherin to the PM. In cells expressing GFPâE-cadherin, there was a greatly enhanced recruitment of endogenous PIPKIÎ³ to GFPâE-cadherinâcontaining compartments, which is consistent with the association between PIPKIÎ³ and E-cadherin. Upon expression of Î¼1B in the LLC-PK1 cells, GFPâE-cadherin was efficiently targeted to sites of cellâcell adhesion, and endogenous PIPKIÎ³ colocalized with E-cadherin at AJs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). The expression of Î¼1Î±, however, did not rescue E-cadherin trafficking to the PM (unpublished data). These data support a model were PIPKIÎ³ associates with E-cadherin and this interaction is required for functional recruitment of AP1B to PIPKIÎ³ via its interaction with the YSPL motif in the PIPKIÎ³661 C terminus.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³ regulates E-cadherin transport by recruitment to AP1B compartments</title>
        <p>The functional relationship between PIPKIÎ³ and AP1B is reinforced by the observation that endogenous PIPKIÎ³ and AP1 colocalized in vesicle compartments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Both E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³ partially colocalized with Î³-adaptin in cytoplasmic compartments after removal of calcium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, arrows), suggesting a functional link between E-cadherin, PIPKIÎ³661, and AP1 in E-cadherin trafficking. Interestingly, when E-cadherin recycling was triggered by replenishing calcium, we observed that overexpression of PIPKIÎ³661 enhanced the recruitment of AP1B to PM. In parental MDCK cells, AP1 showed typical perinuclear localization with a small fraction targeting to the PM. When PIPKIÎ³661 was expressed, AP1 targeted to the basolateral membrane where it colocalized with E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³661 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). However, when PIPKIÎ³635 was expressed, AP1 organization was strikingly distinct, as it was concentrated in a central perinuclear compartment with no localization near the PM and little colocalization with E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In these cells, E-cadherin was largely trapped in the cytosol and was not efficiently targeted to the PM. In PIPKIÎ³661KD-expressing cells, AP1 weakly localized beneath the PM or showed strong colocalization of both E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³661KD in a large perinuclear compartment, but there was little detectable PM E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). These data again support a model where both the PIPKIÎ³âAP1 interaction and PIPKIÎ³ kinase activity are necessary for recruitment of AP1 to the PM and the efficient trafficking of E-cadherin to the PM.</p>

        <p>To further characterize these E-cadherinâcontaining vesicles in PIPKIÎ³635-expressing cells, we induced accumulation of transferrin receptor (TfnR) in the recycling endosome using an established approach (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sheff et al., 1999</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref> (top), internalized E-cadherin in parental MDCK cells showed partial colocalization with both endogenous PIPKIÎ³ and internalized TfnR, representing the recycling endosome, and colocalization among these three proteins was also observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, arrows). Interestingly, overexpression of PIPKIÎ³635, which interacts with E-cadherin but not AP1B, blocked E-cadherin colocalization with the TfnR compartment, but E-cadherin did colocalize with PIPKIÎ³635 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, bottom). These data suggest that PIPKIÎ³661 mediates the transport of E-cadherin from the trans-Golgi network to the recycling endosome, which has been argued to serve as an intermediate between the trans-Golgi network and the basolateral PM (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). Further, this data establishes that trafficking of E-cadherin to this compartment requires a functional interaction between PIPKIÎ³661 and AP1B.</p>
        <p>If PIPKIÎ³ serves as an adaptor between E-cadherin and AP complexes, one would expect that an E-cadherin mutant lacking or with diminished PIPKIÎ³ binding would not be transported efficiently to the PM. A V832M germline mutation was identified in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yabuta et al., 2002</xref>), which lacks the ability to mediate cellâcell adhesion or suppress invasion (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Suriano et al., 2003</xref>). In these patients, the wild-type E-cadherin gene is repressed, and only the mutant is expressed in the carcinomas (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yabuta et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the V832M mutation lies in the PIPKIÎ³ binding region. To determine whether this mutation impacts PIPKIÎ³ binding, E-cadherin V832M was introduced into HEK293 cells and its association with PIPKIÎ³ was quantified. This mutant showed a substantially reduced ability to bind PIPKIÎ³ (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Consistent with published data (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Suriano et al., 2003</xref>), Î²-catenin binding was normal (not depicted). The basolateral transport of this V832M mutation was also explored in both LLC-PK1â·Î¼1Î² (unpublished data) and MDCK cells using GFP-fused E-cadherinV832M. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, although the V832M mutant was visualized on the PM as reported by others (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Suriano et al., 2003</xref>), a large accumulation of this E-cadherin mutant was observed in a cytosolic compartment. This phenotype was similar to that of wild-type E-cadherin observed in the PIPKIÎ³635-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>) or the LLC-PK1 cells deficient in Î¼1Î² (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>).

This result is consistent with a requirement for an interaction between E-cadherin and PIPKIÎ³661 for normal trafficking of E-cadherin.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Proteins that interact with the ECDT not only mediate the elemental functions of E-cadherin, such as AJ assembly, actin organization, and cell proliferation, but also regulate E-cadherin by modulating its expression and trafficking. Here we have shown that PIPKIÎ³ directly binds to both E-cadherin and AP complexes. This dual interaction supports a mechanism for the highly regulated generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> to spatially drive the assembly of the trafficking machinery and to specifically control E-cadherin trafficking. These results reveal a novel mechanism where PIPKIÎ³661 functions as both scaffolding and signaling molecule during E-cadherin trafficking (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). In this model, the AP complex interacts indirectly with the E-cadherin cargo via the PIPKIÎ³661 scaffold, which directly binds to AP complexes via a YxxÏ sorting motif in its C terminus. This represents a novel paradigm in which PIPKIÎ³661 serves as a cargo adaptor for AP complexes. Although PIPKIÎ³661 binds to both AP1A and AP1B indistinguishably in vitro, we found that PIPKIÎ³661 preferentially interacts with AP1B in vivo, and regulation of E-cadherin trafficking to the basolateral PM appears to be specific for AP1B. AP1A and AP1B both use YxxÏ sorting motifs for cargo recognition. However, despite the substantial sequence and structural homology of the Î¼1 subunits, the AP1 complexes are targeted to distinct compartments by an unknown mechanism (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Folsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Folsch, 2005</xref>). PIPKIÎ³661 might be specifically recruited to AP1B-containing membrane domains in vivo via an interaction with one or more other proteins.</p>
      <p>PIPKIÎ³661 may also have additional lower affinity binding contacts with AP1B, as <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al. (2006)</xref> recently reported that multiple PIPKIs bind to the Î¼2 subunit of AP2 complex via the kinase domain. In our hands, the YSPL motif of PIPKIÎ³661 was the preferential binding site for the Î¼ subunits of AP1 and AP2 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>), but PIPKIÎ³635 did bind Î¼1- and Î¼2-adaptin subunits under less rigorous conditions (unpublished data), suggesting additional lower affinity interacting sites between the AP complexes and PIPKIÎ³. For E-cadherin trafficking, the YSPL motif of PIPKIÎ³661 is the key interaction with AP complexes and subsequent interactions may regulate kinase activity. As the kinase domains of the PIPKI isoforms are highly homologous, other isoforms of PIPKIs (e.g., PIPKIÎ±) may interact with and regulate some AP complexâdependent trafficking events (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barbieri et al., 2001</xref>). These putative interactions could be through the conserved kinase domains or, like PIPKIÎ³661, could be mediated by specific binding partners via interaction with variable regions of the PIPKI isoforms. Nevertheless, because PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> is a key moderator of the recruitment and assembly of trafficking machinery (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Roth, 2004</xref>), the localized generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> at sites where E-cadherin and other cargoes are assembled into the trafficking machinery is an indispensable step in this process. This finding suggests that any association between a PIPK and the trafficking machinery must be spatially and temporally regulated. The interaction between the PIPKIÎ³661 and the AP1B complex fits this criterion, as this association is detected when E-cadherin is recycled back to the PM but not when E-cadherin is being internalized (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This observation supports the concept of cellular signals coordinating the interactions between PIPKIÎ³661 and the AP complexes.</p>
      <p>A dileucine motif in the juxtamembrane region of the ECDT is required for basolateral sorting (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Miranda et al., 2001</xref>), and this motif was proposed to be a cargo signal recognized by the Î² subunit of the AP1 complex (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rapoport et al., 1998</xref>). There is no solid evidence supporting this interaction at present. However, if this is true, the E-cadherinâPIPKIÎ³661âAP1B complex could be further stabilized via the interaction of the E-cadherin dileucine motif with the Î² subunit of AP1B. Alternatively, other trafficking components may recognize this motif and cooperate with PIPKIÎ³ and AP1B to provide specificity.</p>
      <p>The E-cadherinâPIPKIÎ³661âAP1B interaction serves as a foundational signal for exocytic targeting and basolateral sorting of E-cadherin. Indeed, internalized E-cadherin accumulated at the recycling endosome, as indicated by internalized TfnR. This compartment contained, in addition, endogenous PIPKIÎ³ supporting a role for PIPKIÎ³ in trafficking though this compartment. Consistent with this observation, the overexpression of PIPKIÎ³635, which binds E-cadherin but not Î¼1Î² (AP1B), blocked E-cadherin trafficking to the TfnR-positive compartment of the recycling endosome. E-cadherin did colocalize with PIPKIÎ³635, indicating that PIPKIÎ³ interacts with E-cadherin in this compartment. The combined results demonstrate that the association of PIPKIÎ³661 with AP1B is require for E-cadherin trafficking through this compartment. The recycling endosome is a major site of AP1B, and this further supports our hypothesis that PIPKIÎ³ functions as an adaptor in E-cadherin trafficking and facilitates E-cadherin transport to and from the recycling endosome via binding to AP1B and generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p>E-cadherin endocytosis can occur in a clathrin-dependent (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Palacios et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>) or independent manner (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2003</xref>). Calcium removal stimulates E-cadherin endocytosis by the clathrin-dependent pathway (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>). As there is no known YxxÏ sorting motif in the ECDT, the interaction between PIPKIÎ³661 and E-cadherin may recruit AP2 for clathrin-dependent E-cadherin endocytosis. Additionally, Arf6 promotes E-cadherin internalization (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>) and has been shown to associate with and stimulate the activity of PIPKIÎ³ (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aikawa and Martin, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Arf6, in cooperation with PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>, was also shown to directly interact with and promote the recruitment of AP2 to the PM (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Krauss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Paleotti et al., 2005</xref>). These combined results suggest that PIPKIÎ³661, E-cadherin, AP2, and Arf6 may cooperate to regulate E-cadherin internalization in epithelial cells. This would position PIPKIÎ³661 as a nexus between AP complexes and E-cadherin in endocytic recycling. Nevertheless, there is no direct evidence demonstrating that AP2 mediates the internalization of E-cadherin, and further investigation is needed to characterize the role of PIPKIÎ³ in E-cadherin endocytosis. </p>

The dual interaction of PIPKIÎ³661 with the E-cadherin dimer and the AP complex provides a mechanism for the specific regulation of E-cadherin trafficking. This dual interaction mediates the scaffold between AP complexes and E-cadherin to facilitate the assembly of this cargo into the trafficking machinery. In addition, the interaction between PIPKIÎ³661 and AP complexes ensures the localized generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>, which regulates the function of AP complexes and other processes in E-cadherin trafficking.</p>

      <p>Our data demonstrates that a loss of PIPKIÎ³ in cultured epithelial cells results in the severe mistargeting of E-cadherin, suggesting a strong functional connection between PIPKIÎ³ and E-cadherin. Interestingly, the PIPKIÎ³ knockout mouse does not share the same phenotype as the E-cadherin knockout mouse (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Larue et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2004</xref>). This is not surprising, as the knockout phenotypes of other modifiers of E-cadherin function, such as p120-catenin, differ from that of the E-cadherin knockout as well (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Pettitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Reynolds, 2006</xref>). Considering the existence of multiple pathways for E-cadherin trafficking, the roles of these E-cadherin modifiers may only become apparent during the development of specific tissues in later stages of animal development.</p>
      <p>Dimerization is an essential property of E-cadherin assembly driving AJ formation (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 1997</xref>). The association of both PIPKIÎ³ and p120 catenin with the E-cadherin dimer may be a mechanism to functionally regulate E-cadherin assembly and could promote AJ formation by stimulating E-cadherin clustering. Because PIPKIÎ³ specifically binds to E-cadherin dimers, the in situ PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation resulting from this interaction may drive other local complementary cellular events, such as actin reorganization (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Janmey and Lindberg, 2004</xref>). Actin assembly is important not only in AJ assembly but also for E-cadherin internalization/exocytosis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>). The association of PIPKIÎ³ with E-cadherin may be crucial for downstream signaling, as Rac and phosphoinositide-3 kinase are activated by E-cadherin and both regulate the stability of AJs by modulating actin assembly (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Noren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yap and Kovacs, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>). Phosphoinositide-3 kinase requires PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> for signaling, and Rho family small G proteins regulate some PIPKI isoforms (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fruman et al., 1998</xref>). As a result, PIPKIÎ³ may also regulate AJ assembly through local cooperation with phosphoinositide-3 kinase and small G protein signaling.</p>
      <p>The generation of phosphoinositide messengers upon assembly of AJs has implications beyond simple control of E-cadherin trafficking. Because E-cadherin is a major suppressor of invasion of epithelial tumors, the cell biological data suggest that PIPKIÎ³ may play a similar role. In exploring this possibility, we have discovered that a loss of E-cadherin correlates with a loss of PIPKIÎ³ in human breast cancers (unpublished data). This finding supports a physiological role for PIPKIÎ³ in assembly of E-cadherin junctions and potentially a role in progression of epithelial tumors.</p>
