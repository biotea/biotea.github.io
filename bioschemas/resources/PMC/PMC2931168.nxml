      <abstract>
        <p>Filamin A (FlnA) cross-links actin filaments and connects the Von Willebrand factor receptor GPIb-IX-V to the underlying cytoskeleton in platelets. Because FlnA deficiency is embryonic lethal, mice lacking FlnA in platelets were generated by breeding FlnA<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> females with GATA1-Cre males. FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre males have a macrothrombocytopenia and increased tail bleeding times. FlnA-null platelets have decreased expression and altered surface distribution of GPIbÎ± because they lack the normal cytoskeletal linkage of GPIbÎ± to underlying actin filaments. This results in â¼70% less platelet coverage on collagen-coated surfaces at shear rates of 1,500/s, compared with wild-type platelets. Unexpectedly, however, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)- and ITAM-likeâmediated signals are severely compromised in FlnA-null platelets. FlnA-null platelets fail to spread and have decreased Î±-granule secretion, integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 activation, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly that of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase CâÎ³2, in response to stimulation through the collagen receptor GPVI and the C-type lectin-like receptor 2. This signaling defect was traced to the loss of a novel FlnAâSyk interaction, as Syk binds to FlnA at immunoglobulin-like repeat 5. Our findings reveal that the interaction between FlnA and Syk regulates ITAM- and ITAM-likeâcontaining receptor signaling and platelet function.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The filamin family consists of three large dimeric proteins (filamin A [FlnA], FlnB, and FlnC) that cross-link actin filaments, tether membrane glycoproteins, and serve as scaffolds for signaling intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). The most abundant isoform of the family, FlnA, is encoded by the X chromosome in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robertson, 2005</xref>). FlnA is composed of an N-terminal actin-binding domain followed by 24 Ig repeats, the C-terminal of which mediates their dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pudas et al., 2005</xref>). Human melanoma cells that lack FlnA have poor motility and continuous membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunningham et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flanagan et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations have been associated with periventricular heterotopia, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or familial cardiac valvular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kyndt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unger et al., 2007</xref>). Loss of FlnA in mice results in embryonic lethality caused by pericardiac and visceral hemorrhage, severe cardiac structural defects, and aberrant vascular patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
    <p>Platelets predominantly express FlnA (5 ÂµM), although a small amount of FlnB is also expressed (&lt;0.5 ÂµM). Platelet FlnA has a critical structural role in attaching the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) receptor complex GPIb-IX-V to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. aa 556â577 in the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbÎ± constitutively interacts with FlnA Ig repeat 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>), and the loss of GPIbÎ± in mice results in enlarged platelets, a phenotype which can be rescued by expression of a chimeric protein construct containing the cytoplasmic domain of human GPIbÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ware et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanaji et al., 2002</xref>). FlnA binding facilitates GPIbÎ± surface expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2005</xref>), and the interaction between FlnA and GPIbÎ± has been reported to influence VWF receptor function, although conflicting effects are found in the literature. CHO cells transfected with GPIbÎ± mutants that lack the FlnA binding site have decreased VWF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schade et al., 2003</xref>), VWF-induced cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mistry et al., 2000</xref>), and/or adhesion to a VWF matrix under high shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cranmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williamson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cranmer et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, another study has shown that FlnA binding to GPIbÎ± negatively regulates VWF binding to CHO cells and CHO cell adhesion under both static and flow conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Englund et al., 2001</xref>). Platelets treated with cell-permeable peptide mimics of the FlnA binding site on GPIbÎ± have decreased ability to activate their fibrinogen receptor, the integrin Î±IIbÎ²3, and change shape in response to VWF stimulation, suggesting that the interaction between FlnA and GPIbÎ± positively modulates signaling events initiated by VWF in platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this study the role of FlnA was probed in platelets. Mouse platelets lacking FlnA were generated by breeding FlnA<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> females with GATA1-Cre males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jasinski et al., 2001</xref>). Offspring FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre males have &lt;15% of normal blood platelet count, and their platelets lack FlnA. As expected, FlnA-null platelets are large, lack normal actin-GPIbÎ± membrane attachments, and have an altered distribution of GPIbÎ± on their surface. However, FlnA-null platelets surprisingly also have severe functional impairment in signaling responses downstream of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)â and ITAM-likeâmediated signal receptors GPVI and C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2). This specific signaling defect results from the loss of a novel and direct FlnAâSyk interaction mediated through Ig repeat 5 of FlnA. As a consequence, Syk is mistargeted in FlnA-null platelets, and ITAM signaling that normally leads to actin assembly, Î±-granule secretion, integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 activation, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation is interrupted. FlnA is, therefore, required for normal ITAM- and ITAM-likeâbased signaling responses.</p>

        <title>Mild thrombocytopenia in female mice carriers for FlnA deficiency</title>
        <p>FlnA deficiency in mice results in lethality in utero as a result of pericardiac and visceral hemorrhage, severe cardiac structural defects, and aberrant vascular patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2006</xref>). Because the <italic>FLNA</italic> gene is located on the X chromosome, we determined whether it conferred survival value to platelets in 6â8-wk-old heterozygous female mice carrying both one WT and one deleted <italic>FLNA</italic> gene. FlnA<sup>+/â</sup> females had a mild thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Their blood platelet count was 678 Â± 278 Ã 10<sup>3</sup>/Âµl (mean Â± SD; <italic>n</italic> = 14), compared with 994 Â± 294 Ã 10<sup>3</sup>/Âµl (<italic>n</italic> = 17; P &lt; 0.01) in WT female littermates, revealing a reduction of 32%. The mean platelet volume was increased by 8%, compared with WT female littermates (P &lt; 0.05). FlnA<sup>+/â</sup> females also had increased leukocyte count, notably lymphocytes and granulocytes. Erythrocyte counts were normal.</p>

        <title>Generation of mice carrying platelets that selectively lack FlnA</title>
        <p>GATA1-Cre transgenic mice were used to excise the FlnA<sup>loxP</sup> gene in the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jasinski et al., 2001</xref>). FlnA<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> females were bred with GATA1-Cre males. In this cross, all offspring expressed GATA1-Cre, and females were heterozygous and males hemizygous for FlnA<sup>loxP</sup>. Only 79 (14.2%) out of the 555 offspring obtained were males. Analysis of embryos collected at different stages of development showed a high embryonic mortality associated with complex developmental abnormalities (unpublished data), which is consistent with leaky GATA1-Cre expression in early embryogenesis leading to FlnA<sup>loxP</sup> gene recombination in multiple nonhematopoietic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jasinski et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

Platelets isolated from FlnA<sup>loxp/y</sup> GATA1-Cre male mice are large but discoid, â¼4.0 Âµm in diameter at their longest axis, compared with â¼2.5 Âµm in controls. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 (A and B)</xref> shows representative electron micrographs of the cytoskeletons of FlnA-null platelets prepared by removing the plasma membrane in the absence of glutaraldehyde with Triton X-100 detergent. In the absence of fixative, the bulk of the filaments composing the cytoskeleton are lost. In other words, cytoskeletal integrity is diminished as the bulk of the F-actin, but not the microtubule ring, rapidly dissociates from the cytoskeleton when FlnA-null platelets are permeabilized in buffers that normally stabilize an intact F-actin cytoskeleton. The percentage of actin assembled into filaments was, however, comparable in the FlnA-null and WT platelets, representing 40% of the total actin levels. Because FlnA-null platelets are larger, they contain more total actin filaments than the control cells.</p>

        <p>FlnA-null platelets adhere to the collagen-related peptide (CRP)âcoated surfaces, which are specific for the collagen receptor GPVI but spread poorly, and have one or more unusual F-actin enriched foci within their cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). In the electron microscope, these foci are aggregates of membrane skeleton and F-actin. In contrast, WT platelets activate on CRP-coated surfaces, spread, and generate blunt filopodia that are enriched in newly assembled F-actin, as indicated by both Alexa-phalloidin staining of F-actin and electron microscopy.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 (E and F)</xref> also shows that the limited shape change reaction of FlnA-null platelets to CRP results from a blunted actin assembly process. Although the F-actin assembly response mediated by the G proteinâcoupled receptor (GPCR) agonist thrombin is normal, FlnA-null platelets mount only a modest shape change and actin assembly reaction after CRP ligation of GPVI.</p>

        <p>The secretory and aggregatory capacities of FlnA-null platelets were further tested. WT and FlnA-null platelets were treated with PMA, which activates protein kinase C directly, and analyzed by flow cytometry for P-selectin (CD62P) expression, as a marker for Î±-granule secretion, or fibrinogen binding, as a marker for integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falet et al., 2009</xref>). FlnA-null platelets expressed P-selectin and bound fibrinogen normally in response to PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and G</xref>).</p>
        <p>Platelets isolated from FlnA<sup>+/y</sup> GATA1-Cre or FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre males were also treated with the GPCR agonist thrombin. Thrombin induced a concentration-dependent increase of P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding in FlnA<sup>+/y</sup> GATA1-Cre platelets, reaching 93.1 Â± 0.5% of P-selectinâexpressing and 82.8 Â± 6.9% of fibrinogen-binding platelets with 0.5 U/ml thrombin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and H</xref>). FlnA deficiency resulted in a significant decrease of platelet responses to thrombin, as only 55.9 Â± 2.2% of P-selectinâexpressing and 65.6 Â± 5.9% of fibrinogen-binding platelets were obtained with 0.5 U/ml of thrombin.</p>
        <p>Responses to CRP and convulxin, which are both specific for the collagen receptor GPVI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson et al., 2005</xref>), were severely affected by FlnA deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D, E, I, and J</xref>).

Similarly, only 42.6 Â± 1.1% of P-selectinâexpressing and 18.0 Â± 4.8% of fibrinogen-binding FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre platelets were obtained with 200 ng/ml convulxin, compared with 82.8 Â± 1.5% of P-selectinâexpressing and 47.2 Â± 2.3% of fibrinogen-binding FlnA<sup>+/y</sup> GATA1-Cre platelets, respectively.</p>
        <p>To determine if the poor response to GPVI is extended to ITAM-like signaling, we assessed the ability of rhodocytin to activate WT and FlnA-null platelets through CLEC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F and K</xref>).

        <title>Impaired tyrosine phosphorylation in FlnA-null platelets</title>
        <p>The data described in the previous section suggest that FlnA modulates platelet signaling downstream of ITAM- and ITAM-likeâcontaining receptors (i.e., GPVI and CLEC-2), cascades initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of signaling proteins that include the protein tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase C-Î³2 (PLC-Î³2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, the ability of FlnA-null platelets to phosphorylate proteins on tyrosine in response to CRP, convulxin, or rhodocytin was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). In FlnA<sup>+/y</sup> GATA1-Cre platelets, CRP, convulxin, and rhodocytin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous platelet proteins, including a 130-kD protein that comigrates with PLC-Î³2. The profile of tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly reduced in FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre platelets stimulated in the same conditions. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that Syk and PLC-Î³2 phosphorylation was severely compromised in these platelets, thus revealing an important early role for FlnA in the ITAM- and ITAM-likeâmediated signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

        <p>Because the block in ITAM-based signaling in platelets occurs early, as judged by the decreased phosphorylation of Syk and PLC-Î³2, we investigated whether FlnA interacts with any signaling molecules involved in the GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling pathways and found that FlnA directly binds to Syk.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our results show that FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre males have &lt;15% of normal blood platelet count and increased tail bleeding time. These mice have enlarged platelets that lack FlnA. FlnA-null platelets lack normal actin membrane attachments and have decreased and altered GPIbÎ± expression on their surface and impaired adhesion to collagen under flow conditions. Unexpectedly, FlnA-null platelets also have severe functional and signaling impairment in response to stimulation through ITAM- and ITAM-likeâmediated signal receptors GPVI and CLEC-2, signaling which requires activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk. Interaction between platelet FlnA and Syk was detected by immunoprecipitation and reconstituted using purified proteins.</p>
      <p>Because FlnA deficiency is embryonic lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2006</xref>), mice lacking FlnA in platelets were generated using the CreâloxP system. FlnA<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> female mice were bred with erythroid/megakaryocytic-specific GATA1-Cre transgenic male mice. In agreement with the inactivation of the <italic>PIGA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jasinski et al., 2001</xref>), we found that GATA1-Cre caused high efficiency <italic>FLNA</italic> gene inactivation in mouse megakaryocytes, as FlnA expression was absent in most platelets isolated from FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre male mice. A small population (&lt;5%) of FlnA-containing platelets could be detected in some animals, suggesting mosaic GATA1-Cre expression, rendering incomplete FlnA<sup>loxP</sup> excision. Whether these platelets contain full-length FlnA or a truncated form, as shown for talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Priddle et al., 1998</xref>), remains to be investigated. The high efficiency of gene inactivation is similar to that described for the widely used megakaryocyte-specific Pf4-Cre transgenic mouse and posits the GATA1-Cre mouse as a strong alternative for studies in megakaryocytes and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LÃ©on et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petrich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tiedt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hitchcock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>FlnA deficiency in FlnA<sup>loxP</sup> GATA1-Cre mice was associated with a high embryonic mortality, as our breeding strategy resulted in only 14.2% of pups being hemizygous FlnA-deficient males, which was lower than the expected 50%. GATA1-Cre is turned on early in embryogenesis and is also expressed outside of the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jasinski et al., 2001</xref>). Analysis of embryos collected at different stages of development showed complex developmental abnormalities, which is consistent with leaky Cre expression in early embryogenesis leading to FlnA<sup>loxP</sup> gene recombination in multiple nonhematopoietic tissues. The FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre males that survived had a macrothrombocytopenia, with &lt;15% of normal blood platelet count and â¼2.5-fold enlarged platelets, but displayed no gross anatomical anomalies.</p>
      <p>FlnA-null platelets had deleterious cytoskeletal alterations, resulting in inadequately cross-linked cytoplasmic actin filaments and poor attachment of the filaments to the membrane. FlnB expression levels appeared to be increased in FlnA-null platelets, compared with WT, which is consistent with a recently described compensatory FlnB expression increase in FlnA knockdown endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Valle-PÃ©rez et al., 2010</xref>). FlnB concentration levels, however, may be comparable in WT and FlnA-null platelets, relative to the increased volume and total protein content of FlnA-null platelets, compared with WT controls. Nevertheless, although FlnB has the same binding site for the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbÎ± on repeat 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>), it does not compensate for FlnA absence, and no GPIbÎ± was detected linked to F-actin in FlnA-null platelets. The F-actin/G-actin ratio at rest and the actin assembly reaction of FlnA-null platelets in response to thrombin were normal, as assessed by centrifugation of Triton X-100 platelet lysates and/or intracellular flow cytometry. The data show that the F-actin disassembly/assembly steps in the activation reaction occur normally in FlnA-null platelets, as described for FlnA-null fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>As predicted, biochemical experiments revealed that all of the VWF receptor GPIbÎ± was Triton X-100 soluble and, therefore, untethered to the actin cytoskeleton in FlnA-null platelets, resulting in a disorganized GPIbÎ± topology on the platelet surface. Together, the data show that FlnA is required for normal platelet morphology and circulation and confirm that the macrothrombocytopenia associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome results from the lack of the FlnA-GPIbÎ± linkage to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ware et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanaji et al., 2002</xref>). Low platelet counts and large platelets have been described in periventricular heterotopia female patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parrini et al., 2006</xref>). These patients were carriers with only one mutant allele and are expected to have two platelet populations: one that is normal and one expressing mutant FlnA. FlnA<sup>+/â</sup> female mice have a mild thrombocytopenia with only 5% of their circulating platelets being FlnA null and enlarged. Further studies are required to determine the distribution of circulating FlnA-deficient platelets in periventricular heterotopia patients.</p>
      <p>FlnA<sup>loxP/y</sup> GATA1-Cre males had a more severe bleeding phenotype than their macrothrombocytopenia would predict, indicating that FlnA-null platelets have functional defects. Indeed, there was loss of GPVI and GPIbÎ± function in the absence of FlnA, as adhesion to collagen and collagen-associated VWF was diminished in FlnA-null platelets under flow conditions. Whether FlnA influences the ligand binding properties of GPIbÎ± has been controversial in the literature. Some groups have reported that it enhances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cranmer et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mistry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williamson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schade et al., 2003</xref>) and others that it diminishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Englund et al., 2001</xref>). Our studies directly confirm the former, pointing out the importance of this interaction to platelet tethering under arterial shear conditions. Diminished binding to collagen and collagen-associated VWF and poor adherence under flow could result from the decreased density of GPIbÎ± on the surface of FlnA-null platelets or from its changed topology.</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, FlnA-deficient platelets failed to respond normally to agonists for the ITAM- and ITAM-likeâcontaining receptors GPVI or CLEC-2. In particular, the actin assembly reaction was blunted in response to rhodocytin (unpublished data) or CRP, but not thrombin. FlnA-null platelets also had decreased Î±-granule secretion and integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 activation. This diminished response is not a result of the lack of GPVI or CLEC-2, as FlnA-null platelets express normal or higher numbers of these receptors per cell (unpublished data). The possibility that FlnA-null platelets have general secretory and aggregatory defects was also eliminated because of their normal response to PMA, a direct activator of protein kinase C which bypasses ligation of platelet membrane receptors. Furthermore, Î±IIbÎ²3 activation in response to the GPCR agonist ADP alone or in combination with the thromboxane analogue U46619 and/or epinephrine was comparable between FlnA-null and WT platelets.</p>
      <p>Platelets express at least three ITAM or ITAM-likeâcontaining receptors: the low affinity IgG Fc receptor FcÎ³RIIA, the collagen receptor GPVIâFcRÎ³ chain complex, and CLEC-2. FcÎ³RIIA is expressed on human but not mouse platelets. After ligation of GPVI with collagen, CRP, or convulxin, the two YXXL motifs of the associated FcRÎ³ chain ITAM become phosphorylated by Src family kinases, i.e., Fyn and Lyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ezumi et al., 1998</xref>). Syk recognizes and binds the phosphorylated ITAM, leading to Syk autophosphorylation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poole et al., 1997</xref>). Downstream signals through adapter proteins, such as LAT and SLP-76, lead to PLC-Î³2 phosphorylation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson et al., 2005</xref>). Active PLC-Î³2 hydrolyzes membrane bound polyphosphoinositides, notably phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, to form soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which releases cytosolic calcium from the internal stores, and membrane-bound 1,2-diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C. Signals are also sent to phosphoinositide 3-kinase, generating D3-containing polyphosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pasquet et al., 1999</xref>). CLEC-2 only contains a single YXXL motif but appears to be active as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>) and signals through many of the same components as GPVI because platelets lacking LAT, SLP-76, or PLC-Î³2 are not receptive to ligation of this receptor with rhodocytin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuller et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>We traced the failure of FlnA-null platelets to respond normally to agonists for GPVI or CLEC-2 to decreased Syk phosphorylation, which then poorly activates downstream signaling effectors such as PLC-Î³2. Furthermore, Syk appeared to be cytoplasmic in FlnA-null platelets stimulated through GPVI rather than membrane associated as in WT controls. Together, the data indicate that FlnA contributes to Syk spatial distribution to the cytoplasmic surface of the platelet plasma membrane, a prerequisite for the docking to the ITAM or ITAM-like sequences of GPVI and CLEC-2 and phosphorylation of Syk. This is a surprising finding and one that posits FlnA as essential for the very early Syk dependent steps in ITAM and ITAM-like based signaling.</p>
      <p>Previous observations have suggested that GPVI and CLEC-2 must be coupled to the platelet cytoskeleton to function. CLEC-2 signaling is inhibited by cytochalasin <sc>d</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pollitt et al., 2010</xref>) and signaling of GPVI is greatly diminished by treating platelets with latrunculin A (unpublished data), an agent which depolymerizes actin filaments. The actin filament cross-linking activity of FlnA may be important for Syk recruitment and activation by the two receptors. FlnA and Syk were associated in both resting and activated platelets. Direct binding was reconstituted using purified Syk and FlnA fusion proteins and was restricted to Ig repeat 5 of FlnA using a series of FlnA truncates. Binding to FlnA Ig repeat 5 is novel, as most FlnA interacting partners bind to the C-terminal region containing Ig repeats 16â24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in FlnA Ig repeat 5 have been associated with familial cardiac valvular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kyndt et al., 2007</xref>). However, the consequence of these mutations on platelet activation remains to be determined, as does the location of the binding interface on Syk.</p>
      <p>Stable platelet adhesion and aggregate formation under arterial shear condition, events which normally require activation of the Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin downstream of GPVI ligation by collagen and that of GPIbÎ± by VWF, were severely impaired in the absence of FlnA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruggeri and Mendolicchio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diener et al., 2009</xref>). Syk participates in the signaling cascade induced by GPIbÎ± ligation, particularly in the calcium rise and activation of PI-3 kinase which follow ligation, and is intimately involved in downstream signaling to Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asazuma et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yanabu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falati et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozaki et al., 2005</xref>). It is likely that FlnA modulates Syk phosphorylation and activation downstream of GPIbÎ± ligation as well. Further experimental evidence is required to test this hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Our data further show that P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding, but not actin assembly, were attenuated in FlnA-null platelets stimulated with the GPCR agonist thrombin. This could be a result of the altered expression and location of GPIbÎ±, such that it is less able to present thrombin to its GPCR PAR4. Another explanation is that signals originated from GPVI or Î±IIbÎ²3 contribute to the thrombin signaling cascade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boylan et al. (2006)</xref> have reported that platelets that lost GPVI after in vivo injection of an anti-GPVI antibody had diminished functional responses to thrombin and that outside-in signaling downstream of Î±IIbÎ²3 engagement also uses an ITAM-based pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boylan et al., 2008</xref>). Older studies have shown that Syk is phosphorylated and activated after platelet stimulation with thrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taniguchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that FlnA plays a yet undefined scaffolding role in thrombin receptor signaling.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results show that FlnA is not only required for platelet morphology and circulation but also for signaling through platelet ITAM and ITAM-like containing receptors (i.e., GPVI and CLEC-2), which requires activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk. FlnA interacts with Syk through its Ig repeat 5 and, thus, docks Syk near the plasma membrane where it can bind GPVI, CLEC-2, and possibly GPIbÎ±, initiating or reinforcing/amplifying their signaling cascades.</p>
