      <abstract>
        <p>The elaboration of dendrites in neurons requires secretory trafficking through the Golgi apparatus, but the mechanisms that govern Golgi function in neuronal morphogenesis in the brain have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> localizes to the Golgi complex in mammalian brain neurons. Inhibition of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> by independent approaches including Fbxw8 knockdown reveals that Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> is selectively required for the growth and elaboration of dendrites but not axons in primary neurons and in the developing rat cerebellum in vivo. Inhibition of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> also dramatically impairs the morphology of the Golgi complex, leading to deficient secretory trafficking in neurons. Using an immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry screening approach, we also uncover the cytoskeletal adaptor protein OBSL1 as a critical regulator of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in Golgi morphogenesis and dendrite elaboration. OBSL1 forms a physical complex with the scaffold protein Cul7 and thereby localizes Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus. Accordingly, OBSL1 is required for the morphogenesis of the Golgi apparatus and the elaboration of dendrites. Finally, we identify the Golgi protein Grasp65 as a novel and physiologically relevant substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in the control of Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis in neurons. Collectively, these findings define a novel OBSL1-regulated Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> ubiquitin signaling mechanism that orchestrates the morphogenesis of the Golgi apparatus and patterning of dendrites, with fundamental implications for our understanding of brain development.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The growth and elaboration of dendrites is an essential step in the establishment of neuronal circuits in the brain. Because dendrites house the receptive components of neurotransmission and actively integrate synaptic inputs, variations in dendrite architecture have important consequences for information processing. The development of dendrites relies on secretory trafficking through the Golgi apparatus. In this study, we have identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>, that localizes to the Golgi apparatus in neurons. E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate the abundance of target proteins by directing ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of specific targets. We have found that Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> operates at the Golgi apparatus to control Golgi integrity and dendrite patterning. We have also identified the cytoskeletal adaptor protein OBSL1 as an important regulator of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> function in neurons. OBSL1 promotes the function of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> by localizing Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus. Finally, we have found that Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> induces the ubiquitination and degradation of the Golgi protein Grasp65 to control Golgi morphology and dendrite elaboration. We conclude that the signaling cascade from OBSL1 to Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> to Grasp65 is an important means of regulating Golgi morphology and consequently the shape and size of dendrite arbors in neurons.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Establishing the uniquely complex and polarized morphology of neurons is essential for proper circuit development in the brain. The growth and elaboration of dendrite arbors determines access to synaptic partners and thus patterns neuronal connectivity. Secretory trafficking through the Golgi apparatus is selectively required for the elaboration of dendrites but not axon growth <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Accordingly, manipulation of Golgi function triggers dramatic changes in dendrite growth and branching <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, the mechanisms that govern the morphology and function of the neuronal Golgi apparatus in the control of dendrite architecture have remained largely unexplored.</p>
      <p>To regulate the development of distinct cellular compartments, including dendrites, axons, and synapses, neurons employ E3 ubiquitin ligases to regulate the abundance of proteins <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Segref1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Lewcock1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In mammalian brain neurons, the ubiquitin ligases Cdh1âanaphase promoting complex (Cdh1-APC) and Cdc20-APC operate in different cellular locales to control distinct aspects of neuronal morphogenesis <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Cdh1-APC acts in the nucleus, targeting the transcriptional regulators SnoN and Id2 for degradation, to limit axon growth <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Konishi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Lasorella1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast, Cdc20-APC employs the centrosome as a signaling platform to promote dendrite elaboration <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that yet to be identified mechanisms of spatially restricted ubiquitination operate at other major neuronal organelles and thereby control neuronal development.</p>
      <p>Members of the large family of F-box proteins act as substrate specificity factors for the Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) subfamily of cullin RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Cardozo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A number of F-box proteins have been implicated in neuronal survival and differentiation as well as synaptic transmission in the invertebrate and mammalian nervous systems <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Saiga1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the role of F-box proteins in neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity in the mammalian brain remains largely to be elucidated. F-box proteins are thought to provide spatial precision of substrate degradation in cells <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, suggesting that elucidation of F-box protein functions in neurons should uncover novel mechanisms of spatially restricted ubiquitin signaling in the establishment of neuronal circuitry.</p>
      <p>Among F-box proteins, Fbxw8 is unique in that it primarily assembles with the scaffold protein Cul7 <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Tsunematsu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Tsutsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Conversely, unlike the scaffold protein Cul1, which is thought to associate with all F-box proteins, Cul7 associates only with Fbxw8 <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Arai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, the Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> complex represents a unique yet poorly understood member of the cullin RING ligase family.</p>
      <p>In this study, we identify Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that localizes to the Golgi apparatus in neurons and is selectively required for growth and elaboration of dendrites. Strikingly, inhibition of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> leads to impaired Golgi morphology and deficient secretory trafficking in neurons. Using an immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (IP/mass spec) screening approach, we identify the protein OBSL1 as a novel regulator of the ubiquitin ligase Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in neurons. OBSL1 forms a physical complex with the scaffold protein Cul7, and thereby localizes Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus in neurons and promotes Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis. We also uncover the Golgi protein Grasp65 as a novel Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> substrate. Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> induces the ubiquitination and degradation of Grasp65, and thereby organizes the structure of the Golgi complex and drives dendrite elaboration. Together, our findings define a novel OBSL1-regulated Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> signaling pathway that orchestrates the morphogenesis of the Golgi apparatus and promotes dendrite elaboration and arborization.</p>

        <title>The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> Drives Golgi Morphogenesis and Dendrite Patterning</title>
        <p>We expressed Fbxw proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in primary granule neurons isolated from the rat cerebellar cortex. Granule neurons offer an ideal model system for studies of neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity in the mammalian brain <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Altman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Hatten1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Following exit from the cell cycle, granule neurons migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL) in the developing cerebellar cortex, where they elaborate dendrites that grow and branch to establish robust dendrite arbors. Among the Fbxw proteins, we found that GFP-Fbxw8 had a unique localization, limited to a bean-shaped perinuclear area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Upon co-expression of the Golgi marker mCherry-GT, which is targeted to the Golgi by a short N-terminal fragment of Î²1,4-galactosyltransferase <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we found that GFP-Fbxw8 co-localized with mCherry-GT in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). We therefore asked whether Fbxw8 might function at the Golgi apparatus in mammalian brain neurons.</p>
        <p>Among F-box proteins, Fbxw8 uniquely assembles with the scaffold protein Cul7 <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Tsunematsu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Tsutsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and unlike Cul1, which may associate with all F-box proteins, Cul7 associates only with Fbxw8 <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Arai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> is highly expressed in placenta <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Tsunematsu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Arai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We found that Fbxw8 was also highly expressed in the developing rat brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In the rat cerebellum, Fbxw8 was abundantly expressed in the first two postnatal weeks, and its levels decreased thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with these results, Fbxw8 was highly expressed in primary granule neurons isolated from postnatal day 6 (P6) rat pups and cultured for 1 to 9 d in vitro, with expression decreasing over time with neuron maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results reveal that Fbxw8 is expressed in neurons with a temporal profile that coincides with the period of dendrite development.</p>

(F) Lysates of granule neurons transfected with the U6/fbxw8-1, U6/fbxw8-2, or control U6 RNAi plasmid were immunoblotted with the Fbxw8 and Erk1/2 antibodies. (G) Granule neurons transfected at DIV2 with the U6/fbxw8-1, U6/fbxw8-2, or control U6 RNAi plasmid together with an expression plasmid encoding farnesylated GFP to label membranes were fixed at DIV5 and were subjected to immunocytochemistry using the GFP and Fbxw8 antibodies. Dotted lines represent tracing of transfected cells. Arrows indicate Golgi-localized Fbxw8 in transfected neurons. Scale barâ=â10 Âµm.

        <p>We next characterized the subcellular localization of endogenous Fbxw8 in neurons. In immunoblotting analyses of fractionated lysates of granule neurons, Fbxw8 was enriched in the cytoplasmic fraction, which includes Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In immunocytochemical analyses, we found that Fbxw8 immunofluorescence was perinuclear and bean-shaped in granule neurons, overlapping with the proteins GM130 and TGN38, which label cis- and trans-Golgi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Fbxw8 did not co-localize with the mitochondrial protein Hsp60 or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In granule neurons, the Golgi apparatus is often confined to the soma but can also extend into the proximal portion of a dendrite. Fbxw8 co-localized with Golgi markers in both cases. In other experiments, Fbxw8 also overlapped with the Golgi proteins GM130 and TGN38 in the soma and dendrites of hippocampal neurons, recapitulating the intricate morphology of this organelle in these neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine the specificity of Fbxw8 immunoreactivity in neurons, we used a plasmid-based method of RNA interference (RNAi) to acutely induce the knockdown of Fbxw8 <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Gaudilliere1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting two distinct regions of Fbxw8 (U6/fbxw8-1 or U6/fbxw8-2) efficiently reduced the expression of exogenous Fbxw8 in 293T cells and endogenous Fbxw8 in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figures 1E, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s001">S1D</xref>, and S1E). In immunocytochemical analyses, endogenous Fbxw8 immunofluorescence signal at the Golgi complex was almost completely abolished in granule neurons upon induction of Fbxw8 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). These results establish the specificity of the Fbxw8 immunoreactivity, and indicate that endogenous Fbxw8 is localized at the Golgi apparatus in neurons.</p>
        <p>In view of a reported requirement for secretory trafficking in dendrite development <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the intriguing localization of Fbxw8 at the Golgi complex led us to investigate its potential role in dendrite morphogenesis. We transfected granule neurons with the Fbxw8 RNAi or control U6 plasmid together with a GFP expression plasmid, and analyzed transfected neurons 3 d after transfection at day in vitro 5 (DIV5). Strikingly, we found that knockdown of Fbxw8 by the two distinct short hairpin RNAs profoundly impaired the growth and elaboration of dendrite arbors in granule neurons, leading to substantial reduction in the number of primary dendrites, the number of secondary and tertiary dendrite branches, and total dendrite length as compared to neurons transfected with the control U6 RNAi plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s002">S2A</xref>, and S2B). Analyses of Fbxw8 knockdown neurons at later time points, at DIV8 and DIV10, revealed that simplification of dendrite arbors and reduction of total dendrite length were sustained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Fbxw8 knockdown had little or no effect on cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the impairment in dendrite elaboration was not secondary to dendrite degeneration or impaired health of neurons. In addition, axon growth was not hindered in Fbxw8 knockdown neurons as compared to neurons transfected with the control U6 RNAi plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s002">S2D</xref>).

        <p>To determine the specificity of the Fbxw8 RNAi-induced dendrite phenotype, we performed a rescue experiment. We generated an expression plasmid encoding a rescue form of Fbxw8 by introducing silent mutations in the cDNA encoding Fbxw8 protein designed to render it resistant to Fbxw8 RNAi (Fbxw8-Res). We confirmed that the expression of Fbxw8 short hairpin RNAs induced knockdown of Fbxw8 encoded by wild-type cDNA (Fbxw8-WT) but not Fbxw8-Res in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). In morphology assays, expression of Fbxw8-Res reversed the Fbxw8 RNAi-induced dendrite phenotype, restoring dendrite length to 77.5% of control-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s002">S2F</xref>). These results suggest that the Fbxw8 RNAi-induced dendrite phenotype is the result of specific knockdown of Fbxw8 rather than off-target effects of RNAi. In other experiments, we asked whether the expression of exogenous Fbxw8 in neurons might lead to a gain-of-function effect on dendrite growth. We found that expression of Fbxw8 in granule neurons at later developmental time points, when endogenous Fbxw8 levels are low, significantly increased dendrite length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>). Collectively, based on loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses, we conclude that Fbxw8 plays a critical role in dendrite elaboration.</p>
        <p>We also characterized the role of Fbxw8 in dendrite morphogenesis in cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons. Just as in granule neurons, Fbxw8 knockdown in both populations of neurons simplified their dendrite arbors, leading to a substantial reduction in dendrite length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). These results suggest that Fbxw8's function in driving the elaboration and growth of dendrites is generalized in mammalian brain neurons.</p>
        <p>To determine the role of Fbxw8 in the context of the developing brain in the organism, we used an electroporation method to induce Fbxw8 knockdown in the cerebellum in vivo <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Konishi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We injected a U6/fbxw8-1, U6/fbxw8-2, or U6 control RNAi plasmid that also encodes GFP into the cerebellum of P3 rat pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). After electroporation, animals were allowed to develop until P8, and their cerebella were subjected to immunohistochemistry. Granule neurons in the IGL in the cerebellar cortex were identified by their distinctive âT-shapedâ axons that form the parallel fibers and by their characteristically small soma size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). In control animals, IGL granule neurons had robust dendrite arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). In contrast, IGL granule neurons in Fbxw8 knockdown animals had simplified dendrite arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). Morphometric analyses revealed a significant reduction in IGL granule neuron primary dendrite number, dendrite branch number, and total dendrite length in Fbxw8 knockdown animals as compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figures 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s003">S3E</xref>, and S3F). Importantly, Fbxw8 knockdown had little or no effect on the morphology or number of granule neuron parallel fiber axons in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, our results suggest a physiological, cell-autonomous role for Fbxw8 in the elaboration of dendrites in the mammalian brain in vivo.</p>
        <p>The growth and elaboration of dendrites is thought to be especially reliant on secretory trafficking <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Because Fbxw8 selectively promotes dendrite growth and arborization and is localized to the Golgi apparatus in neurons, we hypothesized that Fbxw8 might impact the structure and function of this organelle. To test this possibility, we monitored the effect of Fbxw8 knockdown on Golgi morphology in granule neurons. We observed a single continuous bean-shaped Golgi in 93% of control granule neurons, as visualized by GM130 or TGN38 immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3Aâ3C</xref>). Remarkably, Fbxw8 knockdown led to dramatic dispersion of the Golgi complex, appearing as multiple, discontinuous GM130 or TGN38 immunoreactive puncta in a single neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). Dispersed Golgi, defined as two or more GM130 immunoreactive puncta per soma, were found in up to 74% of Fbxw8 knockdown granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, we found that Fbxw8 knockdown neurons with dispersed Golgi had significantly reduced total dendrite length compared to Fbxw8 knockdown neurons with nondispersed Golgi, suggesting that Golgi dispersion correlates tightly with reduced dendrite length in these neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Importantly, expression of Fbxw8-Res, but not Fbxw8-WT, reversed the Fbxw8 RNAi-induced dispersion of the Golgi complex, suggesting that the Fbxw8 RNAi-induced Golgi phenotype is the result of specific knockdown of Fbxw8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In other experiments, Fbxw8 knockdown also triggered the dispersion of the Golgi apparatus in primary cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s004">Figure S4B and S4C</xref>). These results suggest a critical role for Fbxw8 in organizing the normal morphology of the Golgi apparatus in mammalian brain neurons.</p>

(E) Granule neurons transfected by nucleofection method with the U6/fbxw8-1, U6/fbxw8-2, or control U6 RNAi plasmid were collected after 4 d and processed for EM. In control immunocytochemical analyses, we found dispersed Golgi in 62%, 67%, and 5% of granule neurons transfected with the U6/fbxw8-1, U6/fbxw8-2, and control U6 RNAi plasmid, respectively. A representative EM image is shown for each condition. Yellow highlighting demarcates the Golgi stacks.

(F) Granule neurons were transfected at DIV2 with the U6/fbxw8-1, U6/fbxw8-2, or the control U6 RNAi plasmid together with an expression plasmid encoding VSVG-ts-GFP, and after 3 d were incubated at 40Â°C for 8 h to allow for ER accumulation. Neurons were either fixed (left) or were moved to the ER to plasma membrane transport permissive temperature of 32Â°C and then fixed at various time points, including 120 min (right), and subjected to immunocytochemistry using the antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope of VSVG-ts prior to permeabilization (red), and the GFP antibody after permeabilization to visualize total VSVG-ts (green). Representative images are shown. Scale barâ=â10 Âµm. (G) Time course quantification of percentage of neurons analyzed as in (F) with VSVG-ts trafficked to the plasma membrane, as determined by positive external VSVG-ts signal.

        <p>We next characterized the effect of Fbxw8 knockdown on granule neuron Golgi at the ultrastructural level using electron microscopy (EM). In control U6-transfected neurons, EM revealed characteristic features of the Golgi apparatus, including neatly stacked organelle cisternae in a single ribbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, Fbxw8 knockdown neurons contained Golgi stacks that had distorted structure, marked by several abnormalities including swelling and vesiculation of cisternae and abnormal vacuole formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings establish that Fbxw8 is essential for the normal morphogenesis of the Golgi apparatus in neurons.</p>
        <p>To determine the role of Fbxw8 in Golgi function, we assessed ER to plasma membrane trafficking in granule neurons. We expressed in granule neurons a vesicular stomatitis virus G-temperature sensitive mutant protein (VSVG-ts) tagged with GFP, and incubated neurons at 40Â°C to allow for accumulation in the ER <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Presley1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Scales1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Neurons were next transferred to the permissive temperature of 32Â°C, which allows the VSVG-ts to exit the ER. To visualize VSVG-ts reaching the plasma membrane, prior to its permeabilization, neurons were subjected to immunocytochemical analysis using an antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope of VSVG. After permeabilization, neurons were additionally probed with the GFP antibody to visualize total VSVG-ts-GFP. Neurons were fixed at various time points after ER release. After 2 h at 32Â°C, VSVG-ts reached the plasma membrane in nearly 80% of control U6-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>). By contrast, VSVG-ts failed to reach the plasma membrane in more than half of Fbxw8 knockdown neurons after 2 h at 32Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>), and instead accumulated in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). These results suggest that Fbxw8 is essential for Golgi function in neurons. Collectively, our data suggest that Fbxw8 plays a critical role in Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis in neurons.</p>
        <p>In mammalian neurons, although much of the Golgi is housed in the soma and proximal dendrites, a population of Golgi outposts reside in dendrites. Golgi outposts are visualized in mammalian neurons using VSVG-ts after a 20Â°C block, which causes VSVG and other secretory cargo to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We detected discrete VSVG-defined Golgi outposts throughout dendrites in primary granule neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Knockdown of Fbxw8 reduced the number of VSVG-defined Golgi outposts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). Whereas there were five VSVG-defined Golgi outposts per neuron in control granule neurons, the number of VSVG-defined Golgi outposts was less than three per neuron upon Fbxw8 knockdown. These results suggest that, just as in the case of somatic Golgi, Fbxw8 promotes the morphogenesis of Golgi outposts.</p>
        <p>We also assessed the effect of Fbxw8 knockdown on dendritic and axonal trafficking, using the dendritic protein transferrin receptor (TfR) and the axonal/presynaptic protein synapsin. Fbxw8 knockdown reduced the abundance of dendritic TfR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s005">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>), which instead accumulated in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s005">Figure S5E</xref>). By contrast, Fbxw8 knockdown had little or no effect on the abundance of synapsin along the axon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s005">Figure S5F and S5G</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Fbxw8 is selectively required for trafficking of dendritic components.</p>
        <p>To characterize the mechanism by which Fbxw8 promotes neuronal Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis, we asked whether Fbxw8 operates in concert with the ubiquitin ligase scaffold protein Cul7 in neurons <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Tsunematsu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Arai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Whereas other members of the cullin family of proteins act as scaffolds for numerous ubiquitin ligase substrate specificity factors, Cul7 is thought to associate exclusively with Fbxw8 among the F-box family of substrate specificity factors <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Cul7 was highly expressed in the developing rat brain and in granule neurons, with levels decreasing with neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Thus, Cul7 is expressed in neurons with a temporal profile that coincides with Fbxw8 expression. Importantly, in analyses of the subcellular localization of Cul7, we found that Cul7 was co-localized with Fbxw8 at the Golgi complex in more than 80% of granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Knockdown of Cul7 led to Golgi dispersion in granule neurons, as visualized by GM130 and TGN38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g004">Figures 4D, 4E</xref>, and S6AâS6D). Fbxw8 remained localized to dispersed Golgi elements in Cul7 knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). Cul7 knockdown also triggered simplification of dendrite arbors in granule neurons, leading to shorter dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g004">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>). Importantly, expression of the RNAi-resistant form of Cul7 (Cul7-Res) reversed Cul7 RNAi-induced Golgi dispersion and loss of dendrites in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g004">Figures 4Hâ4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s006">S6E</xref>), suggesting that the Cul7 RNAi-induced phenotypes result from specific knockdown of Cul7. In other analyses, we found that Cul7 knockdown neurons with dispersed Golgi had significantly reduced total dendrite length compared to Cul7 knockdown neurons with nondispersed Golgi, suggesting that Golgi dispersion correlates tightly with reduced dendrite length in these neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s006">Figure S6F</xref>).</p>

Together, these results reveal that Cul7 knockdown phenocopies the effect of Fbxw8 knockdown on both Golgi morphology and dendrite elaboration. In gain-of-function analyses, expression of exogenous Cul7 in granule neurons at later developmental time points, when endogenous Cul7 levels are diminished, led to an increase in dendrite length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that Cul7 and Fbxw8 act in a common pathway to promote Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis.</p>
        <p>We also determined the effect of expression of a dominant interfering form of Fbxw8, owing to deletion of the F-box domain (Fbxw8ÎFbox), on Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis in neurons.

These data both corroborate the results of Fbxw8 RNAi-induced Golgi and dendrite phenotypes and highlight the importance of the F-box domain in Fbxw8 function in neurons. Collectively, our results suggest that Fbxw8 and Cul7 act as components of the ubiquitin ligase Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> to promote Golgi and dendrite morphology.</p>

        <p>Among novel interactors of Fbxw8, the cytoskeletal adaptor protein OBSL1 was of particular interest because of a recently identified genetic relationship between OBSL1 and Cul7. Both OBSL1 and the scaffold protein Cul7 are mutated in the rare inherited human genetic disorder 3M syndrome, characterized by growth retardation <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In view of the genetic link between OBSL1 and Cul7 in human disease, our IP/mass spec data raised the possibility that OBSL1 might represent a true interactor of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>. In reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that OBSL1 formed a physical complex with Cul7 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Cul7 is composed of a large N-terminal region that contains a CPH (conserved within Cul7, Parc, Herc2) domain, a DOC domain, a cullin domain, and a neddylation motif in the extreme C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In structureâfunction analyses, the extreme C-terminus of Cul7 was required for the interaction of Cul7 and OBSL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In in vitro binding assays, a recombinant form of the C-terminal domain of Cul7 that includes the cullin domain (glutathione S-transferase [GST]âCul7C) formed a complex with in vitro transcribed and translated OBSL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s009">Figure S9A</xref>), suggesting that Cul7 and OBSL1 interact directly.</p>
        <p>In view of the function of OBSL1 as a cytoskeletal adaptor <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, the interaction of OBSL1 with Cul7 led us to investigate the role of OBSL1 in the localization of Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus. OBSL1 was expressed in granule neurons, and its levels decreased with neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). OBSL1 was localized in the perinuclear region overlapping with the Golgi marker GFP-GT, suggesting that OBSL1 is present at the Golgi apparatus in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In structureâfunction analyses, although full-length Cul7 as well as deletion mutants lacking the N-terminus, the DOC domain, or the cullin domain were enriched at the Golgi apparatus, the Cul7 mutant protein lacking the extreme C-terminus was expressed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and did not accumulate at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, the extreme C-terminus of Cul7, which is required for the binding of Cul7 with OBSL1, also mediates Cul7 localization to the Golgi apparatus. Importantly, OBSL1 knockdown in neurons led to the diffuse localization of Cul7 throughout the cytoplasm, away from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g006">Figures 6Aâ6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s009">S9C</xref>, and S9D), suggesting that OBSL1 plays a critical role in the subcellular localization of Cul7. Cul7 was not mislocalized in all OBSL1 knockdown neurons, raising the possibility that OBSL1-independent mechanisms may also contribute to the control of Cul7 subcellular localization. In control experiments, OBSL1 knockdown did not significantly alter Cul7 protein levels in neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s009">Figure S9E</xref>). Notably, Fbxw8 remained localized at the Golgi apparatus in OBSL1 knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s009">Figure S9F</xref>), suggesting that OBSL1 specifically localizes Cul7 to the Golgi complex. In addition, in contrast to the mislocalization of Cul7 in OBSL1 knockdown neurons, Cul7 remained localized at the Golgi apparatus upon Fbxw8 knockdown or Fbxw8ÎFbox expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s010">Figure S10A and S10</xref>B). Likewise, OBSL1 remained localized at the Golgi apparatus in neurons upon inhibition of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s010">Figure S10C</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s010">S10E</xref>).

        <p>Having identified a function for OBSL1 in the localization of Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus, we next determined the role of OBSL1 in the control of Golgi morphology and dendrite development. Since Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> plays a critical role in Golgi morphology and dendrite elaboration, OBSL1 knockdown would be predicted to induce dispersion of the Golgi apparatus and impair dendrite morphogenesis owing to the mislocalization of Cul7 away from the Golgi upon OBSL1 knockdown. Consistent with this prediction, OBSL1 knockdown led to Golgi dispersion in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>). In ultrastructural EM analyses, OBSL1 knockdown neurons displayed distorted Golgi structure, with swelling and vesiculation of cisternae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s011">Figure S11A</xref>).

Importantly, in rescue experiments, expression of an RNAi-resistant form of OBSL1 (OBSL1-Res), but not OBSL1 encoded by wild-type cDNA (OBSL1-WT), reversed the OBSL1 RNAi-induced Golgi dispersion and dendrite loss in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s011">Figure S11B</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s011">S11E</xref>), suggesting that the OBSL1 RNAi-induced phenotypes result from specific knockdown of OBSL1. In other experiments, we found that OBSL1 knockdown in postnatal rat pups led to simplification of dendrite arbors, leading to reduced total dendrite length in IGL granule neurons in the cerebellar cortex in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s007">Figure S7B</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s007">S7E</xref>).

        <p>To further clarify the functional relationship between OBSL1, Cul7, and Fbxw8 in dendrite morphogenesis and Golgi morphology, we analyzed the effect of knockdown of each of these molecules separately and in combination on Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis.

        <title>Identification of the Golgi Protein Grasp65 as a Novel Substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in the Control of Golgi Morphogenesis and Dendrite Patterning</title>
        <p>A major question that remained to be addressed is how Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> regulates Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis. We reasoned that as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> might induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of a substrate protein at the Golgi apparatus and thereby regulate Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis. Because Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> promotes secretory trafficking and dendrite elaboration, substrates of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> would be predicted to restrict secretory trafficking and dendrite growth. The Golgi stacking protein Grasp65 restricts secretory trafficking in normal rat kidney cells <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, raising the possibility that Grasp65 might represent a candidate substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>. We found that inhibition of Grasp65 by RNAi accelerates secretory trafficking via the Golgi apparatus in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s012">Figure S12A</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s012">S12D</xref>), suggesting that, just as in non-neuronal cells, Grasp65 restricts secretory trafficking in neurons.</p>
        <p>In neuronal morphology assays, we found that dendrites in Grasp65 knockdown granule neurons were longer and more highly branched than dendrites in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figures 7A, 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s012">S12E</xref>, and S12F). Importantly, expression of an RNAi-resistant rescue form of Grasp65 (Grasp65-Res), but not Grasp65 encoded by wild-type cDNA, reversed the Grasp65 RNAi-induced dendrite phenotype, suggesting that the Grasp65 RNAi-induced dendrite phenotype is the result of specific knockdown of Grasp65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>).

Thus, the PDZ1 domain appears to be both necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Grasp65 with Fbxw8. Together, these data suggest that Fbxw8 and Grasp65 form a physical complex.</p>
        <p>We next assessed the ability of Fbxw8 to catalyze the ubiquitination of Grasp65 in cells. Expression of Fbxw8 triggered the accumulation of polyubiquitinated Grasp65 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s011">Figure S11B</xref>). Importantly, Fbxw8 failed to induce the ubiquitination of the Grasp65 mutant protein that is unable to interact with Fbxw8, Grasp65ÎPDZ1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s013">Figure S13B</xref>). In other experiments, Fbxw8 failed to induce the ubiquitination of the Grasp65-related protein Grasp55 (data not shown), correlating with ability of Fbxw8 to interact with Grasp65 but not Grasp55. We also found that expression of Fbxw8, but not Fbxw8ÎFbox, induced the downregulation of Grasp65 in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s013">Figure S13C</xref>). However, Fbxw8 failed to induce the downregulation of Grasp65ÎPDZ1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s013">Figure S13C</xref>), suggesting that the PDZ1 domain in Grasp65 is important for Fbxw8-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Grasp65.</p>
        <p>We next determined whether Grasp65 is a substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in neurons. Consistent with the interpretation that Grasp65 might represent a substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>, endogenous Fbxw8 interacted with endogenous Grasp65 in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). We also found that endogenous Grasp65 undergoes polyubiquitination in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). In other experiments, we detected ubiquitinated conjugates of full-length Grasp65 and the PDZ1 domain on its own but not Grasp65ÎPDZ1 in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). Thus, just as in 293T cells, the PDZ1 domain in Grasp65, which binds to Fbxw8, facilitates the ubiquitination of Grasp65 in neurons. Importantly, knockdown of endogenous Fbxw8 led to the accumulation of endogenous Grasp65 protein in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figures 7K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s013">S13D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the ubiquitin ligase Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> triggers the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of Grasp65 in neurons.</p>
        <p>To assess whether Grasp65 is a physiologically relevant substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in the control of Golgi and dendrite morphology, we performed epistasis analysis. In analyses of Golgi morphology, Grasp65 knockdown prevented Fbxw8 knockdown-induced dispersion of the Golgi complex in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7L</xref>). We also found that Grasp65 knockdown suppressed the ability of Fbxw8 knockdown to simplify dendrite arbors and reduce dendrite length in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7M</xref>). Likewise, Grasp65 knockdown suppressed the ability of Cul7 or OBSL1 knockdown to both induce Golgi dispersion and simplify dendrite arbors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s013">Figure S13E</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001060.s013">S13H</xref>), suggesting that Grasp65 acts downstream of OBSL1 and Cul7 in the regulation of Golgi morphology and dendrite patterning. Collectively, these data reveal that OBSL1, Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>, and Grasp65 are components of a novel ubiquitin ligase pathway that regulates Golgi morphology and dendrite patterning.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have discovered a Golgi-associated ubiquitin ligase mechanism that plays an essential role in dendrite patterning in the mammalian brain. The ubiquitin ligase Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> localizes to the Golgi apparatus in mammalian brain neurons. Inhibition of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> by independent approaches, including knockdown of Fbxw8, profoundly impairs Golgi structure and function and dramatically inhibits the elaboration and growth of dendrites in primary neurons and in the developing rat cerebellum in vivo. We have identified the cytoskeletal adaptor protein OBSL1 as a key regulator of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> that localizes the scaffold protein Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus and thus plays a critical role in Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis. We have also identified the Golgi protein Grasp65 as a novel and physiologically relevant substrate of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in organizing the normal organelle structure of the Golgi complex and for the elaboration of dendrites in neurons. These findings define OBSL1, Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>, and Grasp65 as components of a spatially restricted ubiquitin ligase pathway that governs morphogenesis of the Golgi apparatus and development of dendrites in the brain.</p>
      <p>The identification of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> as the first ubiquitin ligase that regulates the morphology of the Golgi apparatus in neurons bears significant ramifications for our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate dendrite patterning and hence the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Secretory trafficking through the Golgi apparatus is thought to play a particularly important and specific function in the elaboration of dendrites, as dendrites undergo extensive dynamic periods of growth and retraction during development <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. By controlling Golgi structure and function, Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> represents a key regulatory mechanism in the organization of Golgi morphology and dendrite morphogenesis. Armed with this function, Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> may coordinate Golgi morphology in different populations of neurons to achieve the diversity of Golgi morphologies in these neurons and thus give rise to the distinct patterns of dendrite arbors in the brain.</p>
      <p>Although ubiquitin ligases have been reported to operate at other subcellular locales, such as the centrosome and nucleus <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Stegmuller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, in this study we have uncovered Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> as the first ubiquitin ligase, to our knowledge, that not only employs the Golgi apparatus as a signaling platform but also orchestrates the morphogenesis and function of the organelle in neurons. Using a proteomics-based screening approach, we have identified OBSL1 as a critical regulator of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in Golgi morphology and dendrite elaboration. OBSL1 is required for localization of Cul7 at the Golgi apparatus, highlighting the importance of subcellular localization for Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> function in neurons. Remarkably, both OBSL1 and Cul7 are mutated in the inherited human genetic disorder 3M syndrome, characterized by growth retardation <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The genetic relationship between OBSL1 and Cul7 in human disease further strengthens the intimate biochemical link between OBSL1 and Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> as components of a conserved Golgi-associated ubiquitin ligase pathway. It will be interesting in future studies to investigate the role of deregulation of Golgi morphology and dendrite development in the pathogenesis of 3M syndrome.</p>
      <p>We have also uncovered that the Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the major Golgi protein Grasp65 plays a critical role in regulating the structural integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus and dendrite development in neurons. Beyond the control of dendrite patterning in postmitotic neurons, regulation of secretory trafficking plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes from embryogenesis to the establishment of epithelial cell apical-basolateral polarity to cell migration <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Shorter2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Weisz1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine whether Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup>-induced Grasp65 ubiquitination and degradation might also influence Golgi-dependent biological processes in non-neuronal cells.</p>
      <p>Grasp65 is a versatile protein with multiple reported functions in the regulation of Golgi architecture. Several studies support a role for Grasp65 in the stacking of Golgi cisternae <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Barr1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Sutterlin1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, by promoting Golgi cisterna stacking, Grasp65 limits anterograde transport <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Grasp65 may also regulate linking of Golgi cisternae <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Puthenveedu1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Phosphorylation of Grasp65 regulates Golgi disassembly during mitotic progression in proliferating cells <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Preisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Sutterlin1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Sutterlin2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Finally, Grasp65 is also required for trafficking of a small subset of proteins that contain a C-terminal valine <xref rid="pbio.1001060-DAngelo1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. It will be important to understand the diverse functions of Grasp65 to gain further insights into the role of this major Golgi protein in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus as well as in dendrite elaboration.</p>
      <p>The ubiquitin ligase Cdc20âanaphase promoting complex (Cdc20-APC) functions at the centrosome to promote dendrite development <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In future studies, it will be interesting to determine how Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> signaling at the Golgi apparatus and Cdc20-APC signaling at the centrosome are coordinated in the control of dendrite morphogenesis. In addition to promoting dendrite development, the ubiquitin ligase Cdc20-APC also drives presynaptic differentiation in neurons <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, raising the interesting question of whether Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> may also have additional roles in neuronal connectivity beyond the morphogenesis of dendrites. It will also be important to determine how OBSL1-regulated Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> signaling is integrated with other cell-intrinsic regulators of dendrite morphogenesis, including transcription factors, that have been implicated in dendrite patterning <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Jan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>â<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The expression profile of components of the Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> ubiquitin signaling pathway in neurons suggests that this pathway is particularly important in establishing the morphology of the Golgi apparatus at a time when neurons form their dendrite arbors during brain development. Since abnormalities in dendrite morphology are thought to play a critical role in neurodevelopmental disorders of cognition, including mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders <xref rid="pbio.1001060-Dierssen1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001060-Pardo1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, it will be interesting to explore whether deregulation of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> ubiquitin signaling and consequent organelle dysfunction of the Golgi apparatus might contribute to the pathogenesis of these devastating disorders.</p>

<bold>Grasp65 is a ubiquitinated target of Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> that inhibits dendrite arborization in neurons and in the cerebellum in vivo.</bold> (A) Lysates of granule neurons transfected by nucleofection method with the U6/grasp65-1, U6/grasp65-2, or control U6 RNAi plasmid were immunoblotted with the Grasp65 and Erk1/2 antibodies. Grasp65 RNAi triggered robust knockdown of endogenous Grasp65 in neurons. (B) Quantification of fold protein change of Grasp65 protein levels as compared to Erk1/2 protein levels in granule neurons transfected as in (A). Grasp65 knockdown significantly reduced Grasp65 protein levels in granule neurons (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.05, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; <italic>nâ=â</italic>3). (C) Granule neurons were transfected at DIV2 with the U6/grasp65-1, U6/grasp65-2, or control U6 RNAi plasmid together with an expression plasmid encoding VSVG-ts-GFP and analyzed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3F</xref>. Representative images are shown of neurons fixed after 60 min at 32Â°C. Scale barâ=â10 Âµm. (D) Quantification as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g003">Figure 3G</xref> of neurons analyzed as in (C). Best fit curves as determined using a sigmoidal variable slope method are displayed. Grasp65 knockdown significantly increased the percentage of granule neurons with trafficked VSVG-ts at 60 min following ER release (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; <italic>nâ=â</italic>3). (E) Quantification of dendrite branch number in granule neurons transfected with the U6/grasp65-1, U6/grasp65-2, or control U6 RNAi plasmid, analyzed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, and subjected to morphometric analysis. The number of primary dendrites per neuron was significantly increased in Grasp65 knockdown neurons as compared to control U6-transfected neurons (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; total neurons measuredâ=â294).

<bold>Grasp65 operates downstream of OBSL1 and Cul7<sup>Fbxw8</sup> in the control of Golgi and dendrite morphogenesis.</bold> (A) Lysates of 293T cells transfected with the Flag-Fbxw8 expression plasmid together with the Grasp65-GFP or Grasp55-GFP expression plasmid or their control vector were immunoprecipitated with the GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitates and lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (B) Lysates of 293T cells transfected with the expression plasmids encoding HA-ubiquitin, Cul7, and Flag-Fbxw8 or control vector together with Grasp65-GFP or Grasp65ÎPDZ1 were incubated in 2% SDS and then diluted 1â¶20 in normal lysis buffer prior to immunoprecipitation with GFP antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the HA and GFP antibodies. Fbxw8 triggered the accumulation of polyubiquitinated Grasp65 but not Grasp65ÎPDZ1 in cells. (C) Lysates of 293T cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding Grasp65-GFP or Grasp65ÎPDZ1 together with Flag-Fbxw8, a mutant lacking the F-box domain (ÎFbox), or the control vector were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Fbxw8 triggered the downregulation of Grasp65 but not Grasp65ÎPDZ1 in cells. (D) Quantification of fold intensity change of Grasp65 protein levels as compared to Actin protein levels in granule neurons transfected as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001060-g007">Figure 7K</xref>.
