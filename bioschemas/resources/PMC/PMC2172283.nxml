      <abstract>
        <p>To investigate the degradation mechanism of misfolded membrane proteins from the cell surface, we used mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTRs) exhibiting conformational defects in post-Golgi compartments. Here, we show that the folding state of CFTR determines the post-endocytic trafficking of the channel. Although native CFTR recycled from early endosomes back to the cell surface, misfolding prevented recycling and facilitated lysosomal targeting by promoting the ubiquitination of the channel. Rescuing the folding defect or down-regulating the E1 ubiquitin (Ub)-activating enzyme stabilized the mutant CFTR without interfering with its internalization. These observations with the preferential association of mutant CFTRs with Hrs, STAM-2, TSG101, hVps25, and hVps32, components of the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery, establish a functional link between Ub modification and lysosomal degradation of misfolded CFTR from the cell surface. Our data provide evidence for a novel cellular mechanism of CF pathogenesis and suggest a paradigm for the quality control of plasma membrane proteins involving the coordinated function of ubiquitination and the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Multiple quality control mechanisms are required to prevent the cellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of misfolded, aggregation-prone polypeptides (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sherman and Goldberg, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arvan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>). Newly synthesized soluble and membrane proteins that are unable to fold or assemble are targeted for proteolysis by the ER-associated degradation mechanism via the cytosolic ubiquitin (Ub)âproteasome system (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brodsky and McCracken, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hampton, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>). In addition, nonnative membrane proteins are also recognized and targeted for lysosomal proteolysis directly from Golgi compartments (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wolins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Reggiori and Pelham, 2002</xref>). Yet, misfolded membrane proteins can escape these quality control checkpoints and reach the plasma membrane. Conformationally unstable plasma membrane proteins, such as unliganded MHC I and mutant variants of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), Î±<sub>2</sub>-receptors, Î±-factor receptor, and transferrin receptor, as well as influenza HA are rapidly degraded (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ljunggren et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Zaliauskiene et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Benharouga et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fayadat and Kopito, 2003</xref>). Although a variety of sorting signals have been described to account for the constitutive or ligand-induced down-regulation of fully folded cell surface receptors and transporters (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rotin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sorkin and Von Zastrow, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>), the molecular machinery that prevents the accumulation of misfolded plasma membrane proteins is not known in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arvan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Impaired plasma membrane expression or function of the CFTR, a cAMP-activated chloride channel, accounts for the phenotypic manifestation of CF, the most common inherited disorder in the Caucasian population (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Zielenski and Tsui, 1995</xref>). Previously, we have identified two naturally occurring pathogenic mutants that display thermosensitive conformational defects in post-Golgi compartments. The COOH-terminally truncated CFTR, lacking the last 70 amino acid residues (Î70 CFTR), traverses the biosynthetic pathway and undergoes complex glycosylation with the efficiency of wild-type (wt) CFTR (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haardt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Benharouga et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, deletion of Phe508 (ÎF508, found in 90% of CF patients) imposes an ER processing block on CFTR that could be partially overcome or ârescuedâ at permissive temperature (&lt;30Â°C) or by chemical chaperones in cultured cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Denning et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 1996</xref>). The conformational defect of the complex-glycosylated rescued ÎF508 (rÎF508) and the Î70 CFTR has been demonstrated by their increased protease susceptibility, accounting for the four- to sixfold faster metabolic turnover of the mutants in post-Golgi compartments (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Benharouga et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The present work was undertaken to elucidate the retrieval mechanism of conformationally defective Î70 and rÎ508 CFTR from the cell surface that may represent a paradigm for the peripheral quality control of membrane proteins. The results suggest that misfolding of CFTR dramatically augments the ubiquitination susceptibility of the channel in post-Golgi compartments. In turn, Ub modification serves as a recognition signal for the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery that reroutes the channel from recycling toward the multivesicular body (MVB)/lysosomal degradation.</p>

        <title>Misfolded CFTR is rapidly removed from the cell surface</title>
        <p>Three tandem hemagglutinin (3HA) tags were engineered into the 4th extracellular loop of CFTR variants and expressed stably in BHK to monitor the cell surface density, internalization, and recycling rates of CFTR variants. The processing defect of the ÎF508 CFTR and the marked decrease in the expression level of mature, complex-glycosylated rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR-3HA were in line with previous data obtained on untagged channel or on CFTR variants with NH<sub>2</sub>- or COOH-terminal HA tags (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haardt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Heda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>). The rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR have nearly 10-fold decreased cell surface density compared with their wt counterpart, measured by radioactive anti-HA antibody binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b), which can be, at least in part, attributed to their rapid disposal rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c). The cell surface half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) of rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR was â90% shorter (T<sub>1/2</sub> â 2 h and â 1 h, respectively) than that of the wt CFTR (T<sub>1/2</sub> â 16 h), determined by the disappearance of anti-HA antibody binding in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1</ext-link>). Similar results were obtained by monitoring the decay kinetics of bound anti-HA antibody in the absence of CHX (unpublished data).</p>

<bold>Destabilizing mutations down-regulate CFTR from the plasma membrane.</bold> For all experiments, rescued ÎF508 CFTR (rÎF508) was accumulated at 28Â°C for 24â36 h before the measurements. (a) Steady-state expression of CFTR variants. Equal amounts of cell lysates from BHK cells, expressing the indicated construct, were separated by SDS-PAGE.

        <p>To assess whether the rapid turnover of the mutants is due to their heterologous overexpression in BHK cells by itself, the biochemical and functional stability of the channel was measured in polarized pancreatic duct (PANC-1) and primary respiratory epithelia, representing a heterologous and an endogenous expression system, respectively. PANC-1 cells were chosen because the tightest genotypeâphenotype correlation was established for the pancreatic manifestation of CF (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Zielenski and Tsui, 1995</xref>). PANC-1 cells were stably transfected with the wt and ÎF508 CFTR. The biochemical turnover of the complex-glycosylated CFTR was measured by CHX- and brefeldin A-chase and immunoblotting on polarized monolayers. The turnover of rÎF508 was four- to fivefold faster than the wt form by both methods (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, a and b). Comparable data were obtained for the functional stability of rÎF508 CFTR in the apical membrane, monitored by the iodide efflux assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c). Importantly, an even faster functional removal of the rÎF508 CFTR occurred from the apical plasma membrane of differentiated respiratory epithelia, obtained from nasal polyps of ÎF508/ÎF508 patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> d and Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1</ext-link>). The cAMP-stimulated iodide release, mediated by rÎF508 CFTR, almost completely disappeared after 4 h of chase at 37Â°C, whereas it remained unaltered in case of the wt CFTR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> d). These observations indicate that the metabolic instability of the rÎF508 CFTR is an inherent characteristic of the mutant and is independent of the expression system used.</p>

Disappearance of rÎF508 and wt CFTR was measured in the presence of 100 Î¼g/ml CHX or 10 Î¼g/ml brefeldin-A (not depicted) at 37Â°C by immunoblot analysis of equal amounts of cell lysates.

        <title>Recycling of CFTR is inhibited by conformationally destabilizing mutations</title>

        <title>Misfolding augments the ubiquitination of CFTR in post-Golgi compartments</title>
        <p>Although nonnative soluble and ER-associated polypeptides are known substrates of ubiquitination, the susceptibility of poorly folded plasma membrane proteins to Ub conjugation is poorly understood. To assess whether Ub modification is involved in the disposal of nonnative CFTR, the ubiquitination level of wt and mutant CFTR, confined to post-Golgi compartments, was determined. To this end, complete degradation of the core-glycosylated ÎF508, Î70, and wt CFTR (and their ubiquitinated adducts) was ensured by treating the cells with CHX for 3 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> a, lanes 1 and 2, bottom and top, respectively; Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1</ext-link>). Then, CFTR was immunoisolated under denaturing conditions with anti-CFTR antibody, and the precipitates were probed with anti-Ub antibody. Detection of ubiquitinated rÎF508, Î70, and wt CFTR in cells expressing exclusively the complex-glycosylated forms by three different anti-Ub antibodies demonstrated that CFTR is susceptible to ubiquitination in post-Golgi compartments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> a; unpublished data). Importantly, densitometry showed that ubiquitination of the complex-glycosylated rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR was increased by â20-fold relative to the wt channel at 37Â°C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b).</p>

For the 28Â°C incubation, the CHX chase was performed at 37Â°C for 1 h and then at 28Â°C for 2 h. When indicated, cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 2 h and then at 40Â°C for 1 h. Solubilized CFTR was denatured in 2% SDS to avoid the isolation of irrelevant proteins. Then, CFTR was precipitated with the L12B4 anti-CFTR antibody. Immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Ub antibody (FK2) and with visualized ECL (top). CFTR was visualized in the lysate with anti-HA antibody (bottom).

        <p>To explore a possible correlation between the unfolding and the ubiquitination propensity of the channel, the conformation of CFTR variants was modulated by temperature shifts.

        <title>The CFTR-Ub chimera has recycling and stability defects</title>
        <p>If Ub conjugation plays a primary role in the recycling and cell surface stability defect of the mutants, fusing Ub to the wt channel (CFTR-Ub) may mimic the consequences of destabilizing mutations. In-frame fusion of Ub to the COOH terminus of CFTR indeed inhibited the channel recycling by â90% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> a), reduced its cell surface T<sub>1/2</sub> from â16 to â1.3 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> b), and diminished the steady-state expression of the mature CFTR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> c). These observations indicate that the chimera reproduces the peripheral trafficking defects of the rÎF508 and the Î70 CFTR. Fusing a Ub molecule harboring arginines in place of all its lysine residues resulted in a similar expression and recycling defect to that of the CFTR-Ub (unpublished data), suggesting that the lysine residues of Ub do not serve as acceptor sites for poly-Ub chain formation in the chimera. The unaltered internalization rates of CFTR-Ub relative to wt CFTR (4.7 Â± 1.3%/min; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> d) is consistent with the notion that the Ub-dependent recycling defect is the primary cause for the rapid down-regulation of the chimera from the cell surface, as is for Î70 and rÎ508 CFTR.</p>

        <p>To substantiate the role of Ub conjugation in the degradation of the rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR, we measured the cell surface stability of mutants in ts20 CHO cells, harboring the thermosensitive E1 Ub-activating enzyme.

The disappearance kinetics of the mutant CFTR were determined by the radioactive antibody-binding assay after the inactivation of the E1 enzyme. Although inactivation of the E1 enzyme completely prevented the elimination of the rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR from the cell surface in ts20 cells, the degradation of the mutants resumed in E36 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> b).

        <title>Association of misfolded CFTR and CFTR-Ub chimeras with the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery</title>
        <p>It is well established that targeting of certain ubiquitinated cell surface receptors for lysosomal degradation requires the recruitment of Ub-binding adaptor proteins (e.g., Hrs, STAM, and eps15, or their yeast orthologues Vps27, HSE1, and Ede1) to the cytosolic surface of early endosomes (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2003</xref>). Because the hepatocyte growth factorâregulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) and signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) are the primary Ub-interacting motif-containing adaptors that form the sorting complex involving components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT I; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bilodeau et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Schnell and Hicke, 2003</xref>), the association of Hrs and STAM-2 with CFTR was assessed first. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Hrs pulled down the complex-glycosylated rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR as well as the CFTR-Ub, but neither the ER-associated ÎF508 CFTR nor the complex-glycosylated wt CFTR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> a). Selective association of STAM-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> b) and the TSG101 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> c), a component of ESCRT I, with the conformationally defective CFTR variants was also documented by the immunoprecipitation technique. Finally, similar results were obtained by probing for the association of CFTR variants with hVps25 and hVps32, components of the ESCRT II and III, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> d). These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that the interaction of destabilized and preferentially ubiquitinated CFTR with the Ub-dependent sorting machinery is responsible for the recycling defect and accelerated degradation of the mutants.</p>

        <p>To substantiate the inference that Ub-binding proteins have a role in rerouting misfolded CFTR from recycling to degradation, we took advantage of the observation that the hydrophobic surface of Ile<sub>44</sub> in Ub is necessary for the association of Ub-binding proteins (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2002</xref>). If Ub recognition is required for rerouting the chimera, disrupting this interaction should reverse the trafficking defect. First, GST-Ub pull-down assays verified that Ile<sub>44</sub>Ala mutation (UbA) abolished the Hrs binding to Ub, as observed for vacuolar protein sorting 27 (Vps27; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2002</xref>), whereas combining Ile<sub>44</sub>Ala and Phe<sub>4</sub>Ala caused partial inhibition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> e). The Phe<sub>4</sub>Ala mutation was introduced to eliminate the endocytic signal of Ub (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2000</xref>). The Ile<sub>44</sub>Ala alone (CFTR-UbA) or in combination with Phe<sub>4</sub>Ala (CFTR-Ub2A) rescued the recycling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> a) and cell surface stability of the chimeras (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> b).

These data not only ruled out an indirect effect of Ub fusion, but also demonstrated that the recycling efficiency of ubiquitinated CFTR was dramatically attenuated by association with Ub-binding protein(s) of the endosomal sorting machinery. This was underscored by the observation that single Ala replacement prevented the association of Hrs as well as TSG101, Vps25, and Vps32 with the CFTR-UbA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, aâc).</p>

These results, together with the recycling measurements, suggest that misfolding has a major impact on the sequestration of CFTR at early endosomes. Endosomal retention in concert with modestly accelerated transfer rates into MVB/lysosomal compartments is sufficient to attenuate the cell surface stability of the rÎF508 CFTR by 10-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Major conformational defects account for the Ub-dependent degradation of newly synthesized wt and mutant CFTR at ER (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 1999</xref>). Comparison of the ER and peripheral quality control of CFTR suggests that both processes entail three consecutive steps: the recognition of misfolded CFTR, the delivery of the channel to the relevant proteolytic machinery, and the proteolysis itself. Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of membrane protein quality control at the ER (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hampton, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">McCracken and Brodsky, 2003</xref>), the present work represents the first attempt to characterize the peripheral counterpart of this process in mammalian cells.</p>

        <title>Misfolding promotes the ubiquitination of CFTR in post-Golgi compartments</title>
        <p>Compelling evidence suggests that Ub conjugation is a prerequisite for the disposal of misfolded rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR from the cell surface.</p>
        <p>First, we demonstrated a correlation between the conformational destabilization and the ubiquitination propensity of rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR in post-Golgi compartments. Rescuing the folding defect at the permissive temperature (28Â°C) diminished, whereas thermo-denaturation (40Â°C) further increased the ubiquitination of the mutants, leading to the preferential recycling or MVB/lysosomal targeting, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c). Neither accelerated biosynthesis nor the saturation of the degradation machinery can explain the nearly 20-fold increased level of ubiquitinated mutants as compared with that of the wt CFTR. The translational rates of the Î70 and ÎF508 CFTR were comparable to that of the wt CFTR in BHK cells (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haardt et al., 1999</xref>), and the copy number of wt CFTR at the cell surface is estimated to be only a few thousand molecules per cell.</p>
        <p>Second, covalent attachment of Ub to the COOH-terminal tail of the wt CFTR reproduced the recycling as well as the cell surface stability defects of the mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The genetically fused Ub mimics the cellular consequences of post-translational ubiquitination of CFTR rather than provoking misfolding. This conclusion is supported by the largely preserved processing efficiency of the CFTR-Ub (unpublished data), and the proportionally decreased PKA-stimulated whole-cell current and cell surface density of the chimera (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312018/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, the Ile<sub>44</sub>Ala point mutation in Ub was able to restore the recycling and stability of the chimera to that of the wt CFTR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, the most direct evidence for the role of Ub-conjugation was provided by the fact that heat inactivation of the E1 Ub-activating enzyme prevented the disappearance of Î70 and rÎF508 CFTR from the plasma membrane in ts20 cells without influencing their endocytosis rates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Collectively, these observations support the pivotal role of Ub modification in the down-regulation of the misfolded rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR from the cell surface via post-endocytic mechanism(s).</p>
        <p>Ubiquitination is known to effectively down-regulate receptors and transporters from the plasma membrane of yeast and mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rotin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sorkin and Von Zastrow, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>). Ligand-induced (e.g., EGF and Î²-adrenergic agonist) or constitutive (e.g., ENaC) ubiquitination of membrane proteins requires substrate recognition by Ub-conjugating enzymes and Ub protein ligases (E2/E3s; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pickart, 2001</xref>). This process is usually mediated by proteinâprotein interaction domains of the relevant E3s (e.g., SH2, WW, and PDZ domains in Cbl, Nedd4/Rsp5, and LNX, respectively) and their cognate binding sites (e.g., phospho-Tyr, PPXY, phospho-Ser/Thr, or PDZ-binding motif; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Weissman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>). Although it cannot be precluded that exposure of similar signals is involved in the ubiquitination of the two CFTR mutations, we favor the scenario that Ub conjugation is promoted by the unfolding of the channel and involves solvent-exposed hydrophobic protein surfaces. A similar mechanism has been invoked in the degradation of misfolded polypeptides at the ER (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Laney and Hochstrasser, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>). Structural destabilization of the rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR nucleotide-binding domains was indeed demonstrated (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Benharouga et al., 2001</xref>). This mechanism would also be reminiscent of the degradation signal identified in random peptides and in the MatÎ±2 transcription factor (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sadis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gilon et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Importantly, a small amount of ubiquitinated wt, complex-glycosylated CFTR was reproducibly detected by three different anti-Ub antibodies (unpublished data). This cannot be attributed to the presence of other ubiquitinated polypeptides because CFTR was isolated under denaturing conditions. It is tempting to speculate that the low level of ubiquitination of the wt CFTR is caused by its slow, physiological unfolding that eventually terminates its long residence time (T<sub>1/2</sub> â 14 h) at the cellular periphery. The profound difference in the metabolic turnover of protease-resistant, structurally stable wt and the protease-susceptible, conformationally labile mutant CFTR is consistent with the previously proposed hypothesis that the structural stability of soluble polypeptides constitutes one of the determinants of their metabolic stability (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">McLendon and Radany, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Parsell and Sauer, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kowalski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Klink and Raines, 2000</xref>).</p>

        <title>Misfolded CFTR is targeted toward lysosomal degradation by the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery</title>
        <p>Recycling of plasma membrane proteins protects polypeptides from degradation and allows them to undergo repeated cycles of endocytosis and exocytosis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh and Maxfield, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mellman, 1996</xref>). On the other hand, the sorting process at early endosomes offers an efficient mechanism to prevent the accumulation of misfolded membrane proteins at the cell surface. This is exemplified by the second step of the peripheral quality control of CFTR. Using Ub adducts of CFTR, obtained by post-translational ubiquitination or by genetic engineering, we presented three lines of evidence in support of the notion that ubiquitinated channels are selectively retrieved from recycling and are redirected for degradation into MVB/lysosomes. First, ubiquitination efficiently prevented the recycling and dramatically reduced the cell surface density, as well as the stability of the mutant and the chimera (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> b, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, a and b). Second, vesicular pH measurements verified that both the mutants and the CFTR-Ub are targeted into lysosomes after their internalization, in contrast to the wt CFTR, which traverses recycling endosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> a). The recycling defect provides a plausible explanation for the 4â22-fold faster metabolic turnover rates of the rescued ÎF508 CFTR at 37 and 40Â°C, respectively (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>). Rescuing the folding defect and thus reducing the ubiquitination of the rÎF508 and Î70 CFTR restored their constitutive recycling (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> a) in parallel to their metabolic stabilization (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Benharouga et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>). Third, immunocolocalization of endocytosed CFTR with markers of the recycling compartment and lysosomes substantiated the notion that the native and ubiquitinated CFTR are segregated at early endosomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> b).</p>
        <p>Ub-binding adaptor proteins, including Hrs and STAM, have a critical role in the retrieval of ubiquitinated cargo for lysosomal degradation at sorting endosomes (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>). Selective binding of destabilized rÎF508, Î70 CFTR, and CFTR-Ub variants, but not the wt CFTR to Hrs, STAM-2, TSG101, Vps25, and Vps32, is consistent with the hypothesis that transport of ubiquitinated CFTR from early endosome to MVB/lysosomes involves its successive association with Hrs/STAM-2 and the human homologues of the ESCRT I, II, and III (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, the I<sub>44</sub>A mutation in Ub not only prevented the recognition of CFTR-UbA and GST-UbA by Hrs and STAM-2, but also did so with downstream components of the ESCRT I, II, and III complexes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). As a result, CFTR-UbA resumed its constitutive recycling and escaped from MVB/lysosomal degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> b and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> a), substantiating our working model that Ub recognition and the subsequent association of the misfolded CFTR with components of ESCRT complexes are required for MVB/lysosomal targeting.</p>
        <p>Suppressor screens in yeast have identified several class E Vps mutants, including Vps23 and Vps27 (the yeast orthologues of TSG101 and Hrs, respectively), which are either directly or indirectly involved in the degradation of misfolded plasma membrane proteins (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Chang, 2001</xref>). Although the role of ubiquitination in the disposal of misfolded membrane proteins has not been established in yeast (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arvan et al., 2002</xref>), these observations suggest that some of the components of the peripheral quality control are evolutionarily conserved.</p>
        <p>In summary, our analyses demonstrate that the folding state of CFTR is monitored not only during the early stage of its biogenesis in the ER (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brodsky and McCracken, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ellgaard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arvan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hampton, 2002</xref>), but is also surveyed in post-Golgi compartments. Our results provide direct evidence for the functional interplay between the ubiquitination machinery recognizing misfolded peripheral membrane proteins and the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting pathway in the elimination of misfolded CFTR, accounting for the cellular and clinical phenotype of the Î70 CFTR mutation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haardt et al., 1999</xref>). We propose that similar mechanisms may be involved in the recognition and degradation of other structurally destabilized membrane proteins that escape ER quality control or are generated by environmental stress. Thus, the peripheral quality control may have fundamental significance in the pathogenesis of conformational diseases and in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.</p>

        <p>BHK cells were stably transfected with wt, ÎF508, Î70 CFTR, and the CFTR-Ub chimeras, harboring a single HA epitope at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (NHA; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haardt et al., 1999</xref>) or three tandem HA tags (3HA) in the 4th extracellular loop. After clonal selection in 500 Î¼M methotrexate, 50â100 individual colonies were pooled and expanded for experiments. The HA tags preserved the biochemical and functional characteristics of CFTR (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haardt et al., 1999</xref>). Experiments have been performed on 3HA-tagged CFTR variants, if not indicated otherwise. Characterization of the 3HA-tagged CFTR will be described separately. PANC-1 cells (CRL1469; American Type Culture Collection) were stably transfected with the pMT/EP plasmid (provided by Dr. J. Ilan, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) encoding the NHA-tagged wt or ÎF508 CFTR. Cells were seeded at confluence on plastic or on collagen-coated filters (Transwell-COL, 0.4-Î¼m pore size; Costar) for iodide efflux and immunostaining. Differentiation was ensured by culturing the epithelia for more than three additional days. Expression of CFTR was induced by 50 Î¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. CFTR-expressing ts20 and E36 cell lines were generated by retroviral infection (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Benharouga et al., 2003</xref>). CFTR-Ub was constructed by fusing Ub in frame to the COOH terminus of CFTR using PCR (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2000</xref>). Mutant chimeras, incorporating UbF<sub>4</sub>A,I<sub>44</sub>A (CFTR-Ub2A), UbI<sub>44</sub>A (CFTR-UbA), and the Lys-less Ub were generated by PCR mutagenesis. The cDNA of Lys-less Ub was provided by Dr. L. Hicke (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). Similar expression levels of the CFTR chimeras were observed regardless whether CFTR harbored the NHA or the 3HA epitope.</p>

        <title>Cell surface density measurements, internalization, and recycling of CFTR</title>
        <p>The cell surface density of 3HA-tagged CFTR was measured by the binding of the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance; at 0Â°C for 1 h) and <sup>125</sup>I-labeled goat antiâmouse secondary antibody (3 Î¼Ci/ml, at 0Â°C for 1 h; Amersham Biosciences). Specific binding was calculated by correcting with the nonspecific antibody adsorption in the presence of 10 Î¼g/ml nonimmune IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Nonspecific antibody binding was usually 3â5% of the specific signal. Internalization of CFTR was calculated from the removal rate of anti-HA antibody from the cell surface during 2â5-min internalization at 37Â°C. Data are expressed as percentage of the specific radioactivity detected before internalization.</p>
        <p>To measure CFTR recycling, first the endosomal CFTR was labeled with anti-HA antibody (at 37Â°C for 30 min). Then the remaining cell surfaceâassociated antibody was blocked by biotinylated goat antiâmouse antibody (KPL) and 10 Î¼g/ml streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich) on ice. Recycling was initiated by shifting the temperature to 37Â°C for 5â10 min. The amount of exocytosed antibodyâCFTR complex was measured by biotinylated secondary antibody and <sup>125</sup>I-streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) at 0Â°C, and was expressed as the percentage of the anti-HA antibody associated with the endosomal compartment before exocytosis. The internalized anti-HA antibody in complex with CFTR was determined in parallel by monitoring the disappearance of cell surface anti-HA antibody with the biotinâstreptavidin sandwich technique. The internalized anti-HA antibody was corrected for the degradation of mutant CFTR during the labeling. The radioactivity corresponding to internalized anti-HA antibody was â40,000 and â10,000â20,000 cpm for the wt and mutants, respectively. Each data point represents 3â4 independent experiments, consisting of triplicate measurements.</p>

        <p>The pH of endocytic vesicles containing CFTR was measured by fluorescence ratio imaging of internalized anti-HA antibody (Covance) complexed with FITC-conjugated goat antiâmouse F<sub>ab</sub> antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies in tissue culture medium at 37Â°C for 1â3 h, washed with NaKH medium (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.3), and imaged on a microscope (Axiovert 100; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) at 35Â°C, equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) and a 63Ã NA 1.4 Planachromat objective. The metabolic stability of CFTR was not influenced by the continuous presence of anti-HA primary and secondary antibody (Fig. S2), indicating that antibody binding did not promote the degradation of CFTR.</p>
        <p>Image acquisition and analysis were performed with the MetaFluor<sup>Â®</sup> software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Images were acquired at 490 Â± 5 nm, and 440 Â± 10 nm excitation wavelength, using a 535 Â± 25 nm emission filter. In situ calibration curves were obtained by clamping the vesicular pH between 4.5 and 7.0 in K<sup>+</sup>-rich medium (135 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes or 20 mM MES, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, containing 10 Î¼M nigericin, 10 Î¼M monensin, and 5 Î¼M carbonyl cyanide <italic>p</italic>-chlorophenylhydrazon) and recording the fluorescence ratio of cells loaded with FITC-transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc.), FITC-EGF (followed by a 2-h chase), or FITC-F<sub>ab</sub> and anti-HA antibody in CFTR-Ub2A expressors. The fluorescence ratios as a function of extracellular pH provided the standard curve for the pH determination of CFTR-containing endosome. In addition, one point calibration was done on each coverslip by clamping the vesicular pH to 6.5. Mono- and multi-peak Gaussian fits for vesicular pH were performed with Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab<sup>Â®</sup> Corporation). The average pH of each type of vesicle population was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the data and was identical to the Gaussian mean, based on single-peak distribution fitting, except for Î70 CFTR, where two-peak Gaussian distribution analysis was done (Fig. S4).</p>
