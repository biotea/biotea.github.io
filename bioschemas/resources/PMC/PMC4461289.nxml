        <p>Turnover
of mRNA is a critical step that allows cells to control gene expression.
Endoribonucleases, enzymes cleaving RNA molecules internally, are
some of the key components of the degradation process. Here we provide
a detailed characterization of novel endoribonuclease SLFN14 purified
from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Schlafen genes encode a family of
proteins limited to mammals. Their cellular function is unknown or
incompletely understood. In reticulocytes, SLFN14 is strongly overexpressed,
represented exclusively by the short form, all tethered to ribosomes,
and appears to be one of the major ribosome-associated proteins. SLFN14
binds to ribosomes and ribosomal subunits in the low part of the body
and cleaves RNA but preferentially rRNA and ribosome-associated mRNA.
This results in the degradation of ribosomal subunits. This process
is strictly Mg<sup>2+</sup>- and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, NTP-independent,
and sequence nonspecific. However, in other cell types, SLFN14 is
a full-length solely nuclear
protein, which lacks ribosomal binding and nuclease activities. Mutational
analysis revealed the ribosomal binding site and the aspartate essential
for the endonucleolytic activity of protein. Only few endoribonucleases
participating in ribosome-mediated processes have been characterized
to date. Moreover, none of them are shown to be directly associated
with the ribosome. Therefore, our findings expand the general knowledge
of endoribonucleases involved in mammalian translation control.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="sec1">Eukaryotic
cells have created
multiple highly regulated and complex mechanisms to control the level
of particular cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, ensuring
their functionality and providing their
degradation in the case of incorrect transcript maturation, some stress
stimuli, or the accomplishment of cellular function. mRNA degradation
is mediated through several pathways. RNA quality control starts in
the nucleus and covers the transcription and processing stages. Aberrant
mRNAs, which escaped into the cytoplasm, are identified on the basis
of the translation process and destroyed by different surveillance
machineries depending on the type of abnormality. The concentration
of fully matured mRNAs is, in turn, regulated by the RNA interference
mechanism in addition to the general mRNA turnover process. Although
mRNA degradation in prokaryotes is initiated by endoribonucleases,
it was widely accepted that eukaryotes employ for the decay mostly
exoribonucleases, enzymes hydrolyzing the RNA molecule from 5â²-
and 3â²-ends. Currently, the growing number of reports of identified
and suggested endoribonucleases assigns a key role in various degradation
pathways to these enzymes. According to current opinion, the mRNA
molecule after the initial internal cleavage is subsequently degraded
by exoribonucleases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Endoribonucleases reveal
a great variety in the organization of
the active center and, therefore, are structurally diverse. Only some
of them (for example, RNase L and IRE1) share the similar nuclease
domain composition and catalytic mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Moreover, the nuclease domains of many known endoribonucleases
(for example, PMR1, APE1, and adolase C) have yet to be identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> As a result, it is very difficult to predict
novel endoribonucleases
based on the primary sequence comparative analysis. Thus, the enzymes
responsible for many processes relying on the internal cleavage of
RNA (for example, no-go decay and 18S nonfunctional rRNA decay) are
still unknown.</p>
    <p>The intracellular distribution of endoribonucleases
is one of the
options for controlling RNA target specificity. Endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-anchored IRE1 is a good example for providing such localized
degradation activity. After the response of the unfolded protein,
which is a cellular response associated with the accumulation of unfolded
or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER, IRE1 initiates the cleavage
of ER-localized mRNAs to cease the translation and, therefore, mediates
the recovery from stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Interestingly,
the vast majority of endoribonucleases
seems to act in the cytoplasm, because they are found to be enriched
in such cytoplasmic components as stress granules (sites for mRNA
storage and degradation), exosomes (RNA degradation protein machineries),
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC, part of the RNA interference
pathway), and polysomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Importantly, some of
them become redistributed in the cytoplasm to
mediate the response of the cell to different stimuli. For example,
PMR1 endoribonuclease is found to be associated with polysomes, but
it is transferred to stress granules upon arsenite treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Another significant characteristic of endoribonucleases is
their
specificity for mRNA targets. Some enzymes are involved in the general
degradation mechanism such as RNA interference (Dicer and AGO2) and
mRNA surveillance (SMG6) pathways, where they cut mRNAs in a nonspecific
manner. Others cleave particular mRNAs and, therefore, play an essential
role in their metabolism. For instance, Ard-1, G3BP, and APE1 endoribonucleases
have been shown to regulate c-myc mRNA, which encodes the transcription
factor and whose turnover should be tightly controlled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
    <p>In our laboratory, we investigate the mammalian translation
process
by reconstituting it <italic>in vitro</italic> from purified components.
Although the mechanism of canonical stages (initiation, elongation,
termination, and ribosomal recycling) has been well-studied, the details
of numerous regulation steps remain unknown. Recently, we became interested
in mRNA surveillance pathways, which take place in the cytoplasm and
absolutely depend on the translation cycle. These pathways aim to
destroy mRNAs, which cannot be correctly translated: nonsense-mediated
decay (NMD) targets mRNAs with a premature termination codon, no-go
decay (NGD) eliminates transcripts containing the elements in the
open reading frame arresting the ribosome during the elongation step,
and nonstop decay (NSD) degrades mRNAs without a termination codon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Genetic experiments in yeast revealed the endonucleolytic
cleavage of mRNA in the proximity of a structured barrier during NGD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> To determine the unknown endoribonuclease involved
in
NGD, we employed an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution approach
for assembling the stalled ribosomal elongation complex on a model
mRNA coupled with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) fractionation.
The purified enzyme was identified as SLFN14, a member of the Schlafen
protein family that is limited to mammals. Although SLFN14 introduced
the endonucleolytic cleavage to mRNA downstream of the P site of the
ribosome, its abundance in RRL resulting in the complete rRNA degradation
and independence of catalytic activity from translation
machinery raise the question of the authentic role of SLFN14 in the
cell. It was found that the expression level of <italic>Slfn1</italic>, which was the first member of the Schlafen family discovered, has
a profound effect on cell growth and progression through the cell
cycle. In particular, overexpression of <italic>Slfn1</italic> resulted
in a cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> stage. Therefore,
the family had been named <italic>Schlafen</italic>, which is translated
from German as âto sleepâ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Consistently, with the aforementioned diversity among
members of this class of enzymes, it is not surprising that SLFN14
does not share sequence and structural homology with any described
eukaryotic endoribonucleases. However, the detailed biochemical characterization
of protein and mutational analysis unambiguously confirmed that SLFN14
is a bona fide endoribonuclease with yet-to-be-identified cellular
function.</p>

Protein Is Responsible for the Endonucleolytic Cleavage
of RNA in RRL</title>
        <p>Before starting the RRL fractionation search
of the unknown endoribonuclease involved in NGD, we assembled the
stalled ribosomal elongation complex (stalled EC) in an <italic>in
vitro</italic> reconstituted system on a model mRNA and purified it
by centrifugation through the sucrose density gradient (SDG). Model
âHBBmodâ mRNA comprises the Î²-globin 5â²-untranslated
region (5â²-UTR) and nonapeptide-encoding open reading frame
(ORF) followed by a stem structure of 27 nucleotide base pairs (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). This stem was successfully employed for the
assembly of stalled EC and the detection of NGD-associated endonucleolytic
cleavage of mRNA in yeast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> The efficient
formation of purified stalled EC was confirmed
by a toeprint assay. According to this technique, the ribosomal complex
on mRNA yields a toeprint signal at its leading edge. Our reconstituted
complexes revealed toeprint signals located at the beginning of a
stem, indicating that they are true stalled ECs (in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, compare lanes 1 and 2). To detect endonucleolytic
cleavage, stalled EC was incubated with RRL or its ribosomal salt
wash (RSW) and mRNA was isolated and assayed by primer extension.
Although we did not observe any changes after incubation with RRL
(Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, lane 4), strong cleavage was found
after incubation with RSW within the stem, a few nucleotides downstream
of the stalled EC toeprint signal (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, lane 3), suggesting the enrichment of the responsible endoribonuclease
in the ribosome-associated fraction of proteins. We could not identify
the precise position of cleavage because of the nucleotide sequence
compression in this area of the stem. To isolate the endoribonuclease
activity, we undertook protein purification from RSW of RRL employing
the combination of different fractionation techniques coupled with
testing of intermediate fractions for mRNA cleavage of stalled EC.
Mass spectrometry of the final protein at 99% purity in the fraction
identified it as a C-terminally truncated form (approximately 95kDa)
of SLFN14 (the full-length rabbit form is 114kDa) (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The short form of the protein may result from
alternative mRNA splicing or proteolytic cleavage of full-length SLFN14
specifically in reticulocytes. SLFN14 belongs to the Schlafen protein
family found in mammals and encoded by six <italic>Slfn</italic> genes
in humans. All SLFN proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus containing

        </fig>
        <p>To confirm our finding, stalled
EC was incubated
with native SLFN14. We observed a similar cleavage of mRNA as in the
presence of RSW (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D, lanes 1 and 2,
empty triangle). Surprisingly, the incubation of HBBmod mRNA alone,
not in the stalled EC, with SLFN14 resulted in multiple additional
endonucleolytic cleavages distributed along mRNA (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4, filled triangles), suggesting
that the activity of SLFN14 is independent of the ribosome. Because
SLFN14 alone manifests the activity and, at the same time, is enriched
with RSW, we tested the potential effect of SLFN14 on the degradation
of rRNA in RRL. In contrast to HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cell
extract, RRL incubation at 37 Â°C within 12 h resulted in a complete
endonucleolytic cleavage
of 28S rRNA as revealed via denaturing agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis
(DAFGE), whereas 18S rRNA degraded much slower (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). To confirm the role of SLFN14 in the
degradation of rRNA, we assayed the protein with purified rabbit 80S
ribosomes. Incubation of SLFN14 with 80S ribosomes in an equimolar
ratio demonstrated a final rRNA degradation pattern identical to that
of RRL (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). The slightly different
initial pattern could be explained by the protection of the ribosome
with ribosome-associated proteins in RRL. Thus, although SLFN14 causes
the endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA in stalled EC, a role more general
than the initially suggested role in the NGD process cannot be ruled
out.</p>

        <p>Because SLFN14 harbors the AAA
domain, we studied
its ATPase activity by thin layer chromatography. Interestingly, SLFN14
contains the truncated 129-amino acid AAA domain, compared to the
200â250-amino
acid regular one. Importantly, some AAA proteins are inactive
as ATPases, and some do not even bind ATP. Therefore, it is not surprising
that SLFN14 did not hydrolyze [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and hydrolysis
was not stimulated by (CU)<sub>17</sub> RNA, 40S ribosomal subunits,
or 80S ribosomes (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G). To investigate
the interaction of SLFN14 with the ribosome, we mixed SLFN14 with
40S or 60S subunits or 80S ribosomes in the presence of AMPPNP or
ADP and in the absence of a nucleotide without incubation to prevent
degradation and purified complexes by SDG centrifugation. SLFN14 efficiently
bound to the ribosome and ribosomal subunits in a nucleotide-independent
manner (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). Following incubation of
such SDG-purified 80S/SLFN14 complexes caused rRNA degradation (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I). The activity of several characterized endoribonucleases
(for example, RNase L, Dicer, Ago2, and SMG6) depends on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Consistently,

        <title>After rRNA Cleavage by SLFN14, 80S Ribosomes Remain Intact and
Active in Translation Whereas Individual Ribosomal Subunits Degrade
into Components</title>
        <p>To examine the integrity of ribosome and
ribosomal subunits after rRNA cleavage by SLFN14, purified 80S ribosomes
or 40S and 60S subunits were treated with SLFN14 and subjected to
SDG centrifugation. 80S ribosomes remain intact in a gradient (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), despite rRNA cleavage (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), and all ribosomal proteins as well as SLFN14 remain associated
(Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C); on the other hand, peaks of 40S
and 60S subunits disappear (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D,E). Probably,
cleavage of the RNA-rich intersubunit area, which is hidden in the
ribosome, is crucial for ribosomal subunit degradation. To correlate
our findings with the fate of ribosomes in RRL, we also subjected
RRL, before and after incubation at 37 Â°C, to SDG
centrifugation. Importantly, incubation was conducted in the presence
of cycloheximide (CHX) to exclude polysome runoff. This antibiotic
interferes with the translocation step during protein
synthesis and, in such a way, blocks the translation elongation stage.
As seen from the ribosomal profile, polysomes after incubation separate
into monosomes, as a result of polysome-associated mRNA cleavage,
and the overall amount of ribosomes decreases by 26 Â± 3%, suggesting
their partial degradation into components (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). In agreement with our findings on purified 80S
ribosomes, monosomes remain intact in the SDG profile despite rRNA
cleavage (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). Next, we decided to test
the functional activity of ribosomes in translation after their cleavage
in RRL. For that, we incubated RRL overnight at 37 Â°C, increased
the ionic strength to separate cleaved ribosomes into subunits, and
purified them via centrifugation in high-salt SDG (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H). Ribosomal subunits
with cleaved rRNAs were as active in the methionyl-puromycin assay
as intact ones assuming that the translational activity of cleaved
ribosomal subunits is not compromised (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I). To confirm our observation, we compared intact and cleaved ribosomal
subunits in all stages of translation (initiation, elongation, termination,
and ribosomal recycling) in an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted
system employing MVHL-STOP mRNA. This mRNA comprises Î²-globin
5â²-UTR, MVHL-tetrapeptide-encoding ORF and a stop codon, followed
by Î²-globin 3â²-UTR (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>J,
top panel). In a manner consistent with methionyl-puromycin assay
results, we found that the toeprint pattern for 80S initiation and
pretermination complexes and the disappearance of toeprint after termination
and ribosomal recycling stages were identical for intact and cleaved
ribosomal subunits (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>J, bottom panel).

in RRL from different sources, eliminating the effect of lysate preparation
on the length of the protein. Then, we detected the subcellular localization
of SLFN14 in randomly chosen HEK293T and MCF7 (human breast cancer)
cells. For that, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of cells were prepared
and assayed for the presence of protein by immunoblotting. On the
basis of the nuclear localization of Schlafens 5, 8, and 9, all long
SLFN family members are predicted to be located in the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Consistently, SLFN14 was found solely in nuclear extracts of both
cell lines (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). Notably, the detected
protein in both cell types is the full-length form of SLFN14. Interestingly,
reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes are the only non-nucleated cell
types in mammals, and this fact may explain the cytoplasmic presence
of SLFN14 in RRL. On the basis of our data, we hypothesize that only
the short form of protein reveals the endonuclease activity. Therefore,
the low expression level, full-length state, and nuclear localization
create multiple levels of protection from endonuclease activity of
SLFN14 in other rabbit tissues.</p>

        <title>Murine Full-Length SLFN14
neither Cleaves RNA nor Binds to the
Ribosome</title>
        <p>Our next aim was to test the hypothesis that full-length
SLFN14 is inactive compared to the C-terminally truncated form. Because
we could not obtain recombinant full-length SLFN14 in a soluble state,
we decided to isolate the endogenous native protein from the available
natural source. Therefore, we detected and purified it from the Krebs
ascites cell lysate employing the combination of fractionation techniques
and chasing the protein by immunoblotting (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). Murine full-length SLFN14 is a 102 kDa polypeptide and,
like the human form, is highly homologous to rabbit SLFN14. To study
the endonucleolytic activity, murine protein at different concentrations
was incubated with 40S ribosomal subunits, and 18S rRNA was isolated
and assayed by PAGE. In contrast to a rabbit form, it did not cause
the cleavage of 18S rRNA (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). Further,
we asked whether full-length SLFN14, despite the absence of endonucleolytic
activity, may still associate with the ribosome and ribosomal subunits.
Because of the high adsorption of proteins to the gradient tube and
the limited amount of murine SLFN14, we assayed the SDG-purified ribosomal
complexes by immunoblotting. Again in contrast to a rabbit short form,
the murine full-length homologue bound to neither the 40S subunit
nor the 80S ribosome (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, left panel).
To test whether the murine shorter
form of protein can associate with the 80S ribosome, we cloned the
65 kDa C-terminally truncated version of murine SLFN14 (murine SLFN14â65kDa),
similar to rabbit SLFN14â65kDa, for the expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Because murine SLFN14â65kDa was found
to be soluble in small quantities after expression, we
assayed its interaction with the 80S ribosome employing the same protocol
that was used for rabbit SLFN14â65kDa. As expected, murine
SLFN14â65
kDa along with its even shorter form (Î<italic>S</italic>LFN14â65kDa)
strongly binds to the 80S ribosome as revealed
by SDG centrifugation (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, middle panel).
Moreover, murine SLFN14â65kDa causes the endonucleolytic cleavage
of both rRNAs after incubation
of the SDG-purified 80S/murine SLFN14â65kDa complex (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, right panel). In conclusion,
the endonucleolytic activity and the ribosomal binding site of SLFN14
are hidden in the presence of the C-terminal part of the protein.
It would be interesting to know the mechanism underlying the appearance
of the C-terminally truncated form, but this question is beyond the
scope of this work.</p>

        <title>Mutational Analysis of SLFN14 Revealed the Ribosomal Binding
Site and the Aspartate Essential for the Endonucleolytic Activity
of Protein</title>
        <p>To study the catalytic activity of SLFN14, we
employed the mutational analysis. Because the only soluble recombinant
form, SLFN14â65kDa, was available in a limited amount, in the
next clone we removed
an additional 20 kDa from the C-terminus. SLFN14â45kDa was
highly expressed and completely soluble. We purified it until
high homogeneity employing the combination of Ni-NTA affinity resin
and FPLC on MonoS column techniques (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D). Like the native protein, SLFN14â45kDa caused the endonucleolytic
cleavage of RNA in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent
manner, but much less efficiently, indicating that the active center
is partially compromised (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E, lanes
1â5).
To rule out the potential cleavage activity associated with the copurified
bacterial endogenous proteins, we performed the expression and protein
purification protocols for the empty vector exactly as for SLFN14â45kDa.
Compared to native and recombinant SLFN14 forms, we did not obtain
RNA degradation in the presence or absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions
for the empty vector expression control (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E, lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, in contrast to SLFN14â65kDa,
SLFN14â45kDa could not associate with the 80S ribosome,
suggesting the location of the ribosomal binding site within 179 amino
acids beside the AAA domain to the C-terminus (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F). Thus, SLFN14â45kDa was chosen as the basis for
the point mutation analysis. Like well-characterized
RNase L, Dicer, Ago2, and SMG6, SLFN14 is the Mg<sup>2+</sup>- and
Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and ATP-independent enzyme. It is shown
that Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by one Asp and one Asn in
the catalytic center of RNase L,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> by two
Asp and two Gln residues in Dicer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> by an Asp-Asp-His
motif in Ago2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and by one Asp in the
essential Asp-Asp-Asp motif in SMG6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Therefore,
Asp is one of the key amino acids in the
active center of these enzymes. We identified 10 Asp residues within
SLFN14â45kDa,
which are conserved among mammals. Importantly, two Asp residues
belong to the Walker B motif 244LIGVDD249, which is the signature
motif of the AAA domain. It is well-known that the Walker B motif,
which contains the consensus sequence hhhhD(E/D),
where h is a hydrophobic acid, is involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination
and ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, several AAA proteins are not active
as ATPases, and some do not even bind ATP. Therefore, we cloned, expressed
in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and purified four Asp single-point mutants.
We substituted
each Asp in the Walker B motif and randomly selected for the mutation
two other conservative ones. RNA degradation analysis revealed that
the D249A mutant was inactive and the activity of the D248A mutant
was strongly decreased, whereas others caused the cleavage with a
similar characteristic pattern (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>GâI).
Thus, Asp249, which probably coordinates the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion,
is essential for the endonucleolytic activity of SLFN14. Importantly,
because endonuclease activity has not previously been reported for
AAA ATPases, it is equally possible that Asp249 could be required
for the structural integrity of the catalytic center or even the entire
protein.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In an attempt to identify
the endoribonuclease involved in the
no-go decay, we employed the RRL fractionation approach coupled with
testing of intermediate fractions in exmaining the ability to cause
the endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA in the reconstituted stalled
EC. This approach resulted in the purification of the C-terminally
truncated form of SLFN14, which is â¼20 kDa shorter than the
114 kDa full-length rabbit protein. Interestingly, immunoblotting
analysis of RRL from different sources did not reveal the presence
of the full-length form of the enzyme. The function of SLFN14 is completely
unknown, and there has been no work concerning its characterization
at a biochemical or cellular level published. SLFN14 belongs to the
Schlafen protein family based on the presence of specific slfn signature
motifs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> The SLFN family is limited to mammals and
represents a diverse group
of proteins with essential sequence variability among species. For
example, there are eight murine SLFNs and six human SLFN,s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> suggesting that they may have different species
specific functions. The precise
role of SLFN proteins in the cell remains to be identified; however,
several members of the family are found to be involved in development,
cell proliferation, and immune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> SLFN14 contains the AAA domain at the N-terminus and
the motif, homologous to the superfamily of DNA/RNA helicases, at
the C-terminus. AAA proteins, where AAA is the abbreviation for ATPase
associated with diverse cellular activities, make up the large and
functionally diverse protein family involved in a wide variety of
processes such as DNA replication, protein degradation, membrane fusion,
microtubule severing, peroxisome biogenesis, signal transduction,
and the regulation of gene expression. Notably, SLFN14 possesses the
shortened 129-amino acid AAA domain, compared to the 200â250-amino
acid regular one, without several signature motifs. For example,
the Walker A motif, which is involved in ATP binding, is absent. In
contrast to other SLFN members, SLFN14 is highly homologous among
all species where it is present, for example, in rabbit, human, chimpanzee,
cow, rat, dog, and mouse.</p>
      <p>In the control
experiment, native rabbit SLFN14 caused the endonucleolytic cleavage
of mRNA in the proximity of the stalled EC. Surprisingly, this enzyme
also resulted in multiple cleavages all along mRNA in the binary SLFN14/mRNA
complex in a ribosome-independent manner. Because SLFN14 is enriched
with RSW, we tested its potential effect on the stability of rRNA
in RRL and found that both 28S and 18S rRNAs became fully degraded
with the formation of the characteristic endonucleolytic cleavage
pattern after the incubation of RRL for 12 h at 37 Â°C. Absolutely
the same final degradation pattern was obtained after
the incubation for 12 h of the 80S/SLFN14 binary complex with the
equimolar ratio of components
assuming that SLFN14 is indeed involved in the rRNA cleavage in RRL.
Consistently, it also cut rRNA when it was mixed with individual ribosomal
subunits, producing again the characteristic degradation pattern.
To confirm the universality of endonucleolytic activity, SLFN14 was
assayed in the presence of different types of RNA. It caused the cleavage
of all tested mRNAs and tRNAs. In agreement with the enrichment in
RSW, SLFN14 binds to the ribosome and both ribosomal subunits, and
the association is ATP-independent. Ribosomal binding unambiguously
indicates the role of this protein in the translation regulation.
Like those of well-characterized RNase L, Dicer, Ago2, and SMG6 endoribonucleases,
the nuclease activity of SLFN14 is Mg<sup>2+</sup>- and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and ATP-independent. Moreover, despite the presence of
the
AAA domain, SLFN14 does not hydrolyze ATP and the hydrolysis is not
stimulated by either the ribosome or RNA. It is not surprising, because
some AAA proteins do not even bind ATP. Because of the high structural
diversity, the nuclease domains responsible for the endonucleolytic
activity of many enzymes are not identified yet, and this is the case
for SLFN14. However, like previously mentioned endoribonucleases,
SLFN14 shares the same divalent ion-mediated mechanism of phosphodiester
bond activation in the catalytic center of the protein.</p>
      <p>To confirm
the correct assignment of the endonucleolytic activity
to SLFN14, we purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> the recombinant
human SLFN14â65kDa, which represents the C-terminally truncated
form of protein. Unfortunately,
we could not obtain a longer form in a soluble state after expression.
This protein efficiently binds to the ribosome and causes RNA degradation,
showing that the C-terminal third of SLFN14 is dispensable for both
activities. To test the sequence and structure specificities of SLFN14
in the cleavage of RNA, we assayed the enzyme in the presence of model
mRNAs with the definite single-stranded and structured regions. We
did not detect any sequence and structure preferences. We assume that
the hydrolysis takes place in the energetically favorable phosphodiester
bonds, which,
in turn, are defined by the tertiary structure of RNA. In contrast
to multiple cleavages of the free mRNA, ribosome-bound SLFN14 cuts
mRNA in the 80S initiation complex and different elongation complexes
predominantly at the spatially closest energetically favorable site.
Because SLFN14 in association
with the ribosome also cleaves rRNAs, we identified its ribosomal
binding site employing the primer extension technique. In the binary
40S/SLFN14 complex, the enzyme cuts 18S rRNA at the distal end of
expansion segments ES3S, ES6S, and ES12S, indicating its location
at the low part of the body of the 40S subunit and likely at the corresponding
low part of the 60S subunit in the 80S ribosome. Interestingly, expansion
segments are absent in prokaryotic ribosomes, and their functions
mainly remain obscure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> After rRNA cleavage
of individual ribosomal subunits,
they both degrade into components. In contrast, after rRNA cleavage
of 80S ribosomes, the last remain undegraded. Interestingly, the simultaneous
presence of several cuts in rRNA does not influence the integrity
of the 80S ribosome. Analysis of the intracellular distribution of
SLFN14 in RRL revealed that the enzyme is associated with ribosomes
and is absent in the free form in the cytoplasm. Moreover, it is overexpressed
and is presented in an equimolar ratio with ribosomes, indicating
the enormous content of this endoribonuclease in reticulocytes. As
a result, SLFN14 is one of few major ribosome-associated proteins
in RRL. In a manner consistent with the high ribosomal affinity, SLFN14
in RRL cleaves first of all ribosomal and ribosome-associated RNA
but potentially may cleave any type of RNA, resulting in the separation
of polysomes into monosomes. Surprisingly, cleaved 80S ribosomes are
active in all stages of translation (initiation, elongation, termination,
and ribosomal recycling). Because the rRNA-rich intersubunit area
remains hidden in the ribosome, the integrity and the catalytic centers
involved in translation activity of ribosomes, obviously, are not
compromised.</p>
      <p>We also tried to understand the mechanism by which
other cell types
preserve the RNA integrity from the endonucleolytic activity of SLFN14.
We found that in contrast to reticulocytes, the SLFN14 level is below
the detection limit in brain, lung, and liver tissues. Our data are
supported by two other reports in which the relative level of SLFN14
expression was found to be very low in primary normal human melanocytes
and malignant melanoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> and was
shown to be very low or even below the detection
level in HEK293, HEK293T, HeLa, CEM, and Jurkat cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Our analysis of the subcellular distribution
in nucleated
cells revealed that SLFN14 is located in the nucleus and is represented
by the full-length form in HEK293T and MCF7 cells. Thus, the low expression
level and nuclear localization may create the barrier for RNA degradation
by SLFN14. Consistently, we did not detect the RNA cleavage after
incubation of HEK293T lysate, although the latter contains SLFN14
as revealed by immunoblotting. Moreover, because SLFN14 is represented
by the full-length version in tested nucleated cells and by the C-terminally
truncated version in RRL, we assign the endonuclease activity to the
short form of the protein. It is well-known that some members of caspases,
the family of cysteine proteases,
become activated by the proteolytic cleavage of their pro forms. To
test our hypothesis, we purified native murine full-length SLFN14
from Krebs ascites cell lysate. In contrast to the short form, the
full-length SLFN14 did not bind to the ribosome and ribosomal subunits
and did not cleave the rRNA, confirming our hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Finally,
we employed the mutational analysis to identify the ribosomal
binding site and to gain insights into the organization of the catalytic
center of SLFN14. We located the ribosomal binding site within 179
amino acids in the central part of the protein beside the AAA domain
to the C-terminus. Like those of well-characterized RNase L, Dicer,
Ago2, and SMG6 endoribonucleases, the activity of SLFN14 strictly
depends on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions. Aspartic acid
plays the essential role of the coordination of divalent ion in the
catalytic center of all four mentioned endoribonucleases. Analyzing
different point mutants of SLFN14, we found that Asp249 is critical
for its endonucleolytic activity. Asp249 is located in the Walker
B motif, which is the signature motif of the AAA domain. Interestingly,
the Walker B motif of SLFN14 with the sequence 244LIGVDD249 belongs
to the minor subgroup of Walker B motifs within AAA proteins with
the consensus sequence hhhhD(E/D), where h is a hydrophobic acid.
Generally, the last amino acid of the consensus sequence is glutamate,
and only few members of AAA proteins contain aspartate instead. Another
important detail is that the AAA domain of SLFN14 is substantially
shorter than the regular AAA domain of AAA proteins (129 amino acids
vs 200â250 amino acids), and as a result, some signature motifs
are missing.
Thus, we assume that the evolutionarily modified AAA domain of SLFN14,
which originally couples ATP hydrolysis with conformational changes
of protein, lost ATP hydrolyzing activity but retained the ability
to coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and currently constitutes the part
of the catalytic center of the enzyme. However, because endonuclease
activity has not been ascribed so far to the AAA domain, it is equally
possible that Asp249 is important for the structural integrity of
the catalytic center or even the entire protein.</p>
      <p>On the basis
of our data, we suggest several possible target processes
for SLFN14. The first proposed process is limited to reticulocytes.
Mammalian reticulocytes do not have a cell nucleus but contain a network
of ribosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> They become fully matured erythrocytes as their ribosomes are degraded
by intracellular enzymes. In particular, polysomes separate into monosomes,
reduce in number, and disappear, and the total RNA content decreases
in parallel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> The rate of RNA degradation during
reticulocyte maturation <italic>in vitro</italic> at 37 Â°C is
4%
per hour. Additionally, ribosomes and ribosome-associated RNA are
degraded at a rate greater than that of free RNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> To date, reticulocyte maturation and, particularly,
RNA degradation have been studied at the cellular level, but the mechanism
is still unknown. Several reports of the characterization of ribonucleases
responsible for RNA degradation have been presented, but their data
are contradictory to each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> We found that SLFN14 binds specifically
and exceptionally to ribosomes
and ribosomal subunits and cleaves ribosomal and ribosome-associated
RNA. These results are in a good agreement with the preferential degradation
of ribosomes and ribosome-associated RNA rather than free RNA during
intact rabbit reticulocyte maturation <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> Ribosomal binding of SLFN14 is a good strategy
for the
targeted degradation of actively translating mRNAs. This approach
may help reticulocytes save energy for other cellular processes because
the energy production is also terminated during reticulocyte maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Importantly, the requirement to degrade different
RNAs
may explain the sequence nonspecificity of SLFN14. We determined that
incubation of SLFN14 with ribosomes
at a physiological ratio results in complete rRNA degradation in only
12 h, which is also consistent with the low RNA degradation rate in
intact
reticulocytes. RNA degradation along with clearance from many cellular
organelles and the lack of DNA in mammalian reticulocytes are unique
among vertebrates. As a result, mammalian erythrocytes are optimized
for oxygen transport. Therefore, the <italic>Slfn14</italic> gene
could originate in the evolution of mammals presumably to contribute
to the efficiency of erythrocytes. Second, SLFN14 could be involved
in the antiviral host response. It is well-known that RNase L is an
interferon (IFN)-activated endoribonuclease,
which destroys total cellular RNA, including viral RNA. The expression
of several members of the Schlafen protein family is induced by IFN-Î±
in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Although SLFN14 was not tested,
all <italic>Slfn</italic> genes are located in the same chromosomal
locus at least in mouse,
rat, and human,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and the expression of
SLFN14 should be also upregulated
in response to the IFN stimulus. Therefore, upon activation, SLFN14
may play a role in the clearance of total cellular RNA similar to
that of RNase L. Finally, the enzyme may be the missing endoribonuclease
in the NGD pathway. To date, we have insufficient experimental data
to confirm or rule out this guess. Despite our suggestions, the real
process for the activity of SLFN14 is yet to be identified. However,
because only a few endoribonucleases involved in mammalian translation
control have been characterized so far, the discovery and biochemical
analysis of novel endoribonuclease SLFN14 expand our knowledge of
the role of this class of enzymes in the ribosome-mediated processes.</p>
