      <abstract>
        <p>Lon is an essential, multitasking AAA<sup>+</sup> protease regulating many cellular processes in species across all kingdoms of life. Altered expression levels of the human mitochondrial Lon protease (<italic>h</italic>Lon) are linked to serious diseases including myopathies, paraplegia, and cancer. Here, we present the first 3D structure of full-length <italic>h</italic>Lon using cryo-electron microscopy. <italic>h</italic>Lon has a unique three-dimensional structure, in which the proteolytic and ATP-binding domains (AP-domain) form a hexameric chamber, while the N-terminal domain is arranged as a trimer of dimers. These two domains are linked by a narrow trimeric channel composed likely of coiled-coil helices. In the presence of AMP-PNP, the AP-domain has a closed-ring conformation and its N-terminal entry gate appears closed, but in ADP binding, it switches to a lock-washer conformation and its N-terminal gate opens, which is accompanied by a rearrangement of the N-terminal domain. We have also found that both the enzymatic activities and the 3D structure of a <italic>h</italic>Lon mutant lacking the first 156 amino acids are severely disturbed, showing that <italic>h</italic>Lonâs N-terminal domains are crucial for the overall structure of the <italic>h</italic>Lon, maintaining a conformation allowing its proper functioning.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Human Lon (<italic>h</italic>Lon, P36776) is a mitochondrial AAA<sup>+</sup> protein (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) belonging to the LonA protease subfamily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Its primary function is the degradation of misfolded, oxidatively modified and regulatory proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, but it also participates in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and possesses a chaperone activity important for the proper assembly of protein complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Changes in <italic>h</italic>Lon expression have been linked to severe diseases, including epilepsy, myopathy, paraplegia, and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In several cancerous tissues, overexpression of <italic>h</italic>Lon promoted proliferation of cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> by remodeling their mitochondrial functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> while its down-regulation led to apoptosis and cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Silencing of <italic>h</italic>Lon or pharmacologically inhibiting its activity has therefore been considered as a new target for the development of anticancer drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>Like other ATPases, Lonâs activities are accompanied by conformational changes induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Early biochemical studies revealed that the binding of protein substrates by Lon stimulates its ATPase and peptidase activities and that this activation is likely to be allosteric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Menon and Goldberg<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> first suggested a substrate-induced proteolytic mechanism, in which the default state of Lon is its inactive, ADP-bound form preventing accidental degradation of cellular proteins. Upon substrate binding, this form releases its ADP molecules and binds ATP, which is followed by its rapid hydrolysis and the cleavage of peptide bonds. In this mechanism, Lon can bind and hydrolyze ATP as long as the substrate binding sites are occupied. More recently, the idea that Lonâs ATPase and protease activities are under allosteric control has been supported by degron binding studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and Su <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> have very recently found that binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to Lon protease from <italic>M. taiwanensis (Mta</italic>Lon) induces conformational changes in Lonâs AP-domain that accompany ATP-independent partial proteolysis of unfolded proteins and cleavage of specific peptides.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the Lon protease is a dynamic protein whose functional domains (proteolytic, ATPase-, and N-terminal domains) are present on a single polypeptide chain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This arrangement distinguishes it from most other AAA<sup>+</sup> proteases; the exceptions are the bacterial FtsH and <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. To date, a full-length three-dimensional Lon structure has not been determined, and therefore its complex mechanisms of action are only partially understood. Although several LonA X-ray crystal structures have been reported to date, some of them representing a substantial portion of the molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, none of them have shown the complete oligomeric protein complex. The most complete structural study reported the determination of two sub-structures of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Lon (<italic>Bs</italic>Lon), which covered part of its N-terminal domain (PDB ID:3M65) and both its ATPase and proteolytic domains (PDB ID: 3M6A)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The region linking these two domains was not determined, however, the amino acid sequence analysis suggested that it was likely to be formed by coiled-coils. This linker region seems to be crucial: an <italic>E. coli</italic> Lon mutated in or lacking this region exhibits severely decreased ATPase activity and disruption to both its substrate translocation and degradation abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Recently, four X-ray crystal structures of <italic>M. taiwanensis</italic> LonA have been resolved, including the structure of the AP-domain bound to three ADP molecules (PDB ID: 4YPL). Interestingly, the <italic>Bs</italic>Lon AP-domain crystallized as an open, helically arranged hexamer when bound to six molecules of ADP, but the <italic>Mta</italic>Lonâs AP-domain adopted a planar conformation. Unfortunately, electron microscopy (EM) studies of Lon and its bacterial and yeast counterparts FtsH and <italic>m</italic>-AAA proteases have likewise failed to provide a clear picture of the overall organization of the protease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this work, we present the first full-length structures of a LonA protease and show the importance of the N-terminal domain for its integrity. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we studied the structure of a proteolytically inactive <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A mutant, which retains near wild-type levels of ATPase activity. We determined the structure of this mutant after its incubation with the non-hydrolyzable ATP-analogue AMP-PNP and with ADP at resolutions of 15âÃ and 21âÃ, respectively. In order to study the role of <italic>h</italic>Lonâs N-terminal domain, we also determined the enzymatic properties of a <italic>h</italic>Lon protein lacking its first 270 amino acids (<italic>h</italic>LonÎ270) and acquired insight into its structure by a cryo-EM analysis. The deletion includes the 114 amino acids of the mitochondrial targeting pre-sequence and 156 amino acids from the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Since both the enzymatic activities of <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 were severely disturbed and its structure showed high variability, the missing 156 N-terminal residues are essential for the stability and proper functioning of the <italic>h</italic>Lon hexamer.</p>

        <title>Structure of the proteolytically inactive <italic>h</italic>Lon incubated with AMP-PNP</title>
        <p>The three-dimensional cryo-EM analysis of the S855A Lon at 15âÃ revealed that <italic>h</italic>Lon, in the presence of AMP-PNP, forms an asymmetric hexamer ~230âÃ long by 143âÃ across. The structure can be divided into three regions, the âheadâ, the âneckâ, and the âlegsâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2a</xref>). Individual cross-sections perpendicular to the <italic>z</italic>-axis show signs of six-fold symmetry in the head and three-fold symmetry in the neck and legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), while interconnection of their centers of mass gives rise to a curve and the reconstructed structure appears slightly bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
        <p>The barrel-like âheadâ has pseudo six-fold symmetry, with individual subunits arranged in a planar conformation. It could be fitted without steric clashes with six subunits from the crystal structure of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Lon (PDB ID 3M6A, chain A) containing the proteolytic and the ATP-binding domains (AP-domain). The âheadâ therefore contains the catalytic chamber of the protein complex, which has a 20âÃ diameter opening at its C-terminal side, but no opening at its N-terminal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, cross-section 3). The fitted 3M6A subunits revealed that this closure corresponds to <italic>h</italic>Lonâs large ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) containing the aromatic-hydrophobic motif (Ar-Î¦) in the axial pore loops (RTYVG), which are characteristic for ATP unfoldases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and form an entry gate to the catalytic chamber in structures of compartmental proteases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, <italic>T. onnurineus</italic> LonB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and in the recently acquired structure of <italic>Mta</italic>Lonâs AP-domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Interestingly, the <italic>Mta</italic>Lon 4YPL crystal structure adopted a planar conformation as well, even if it contains three ADP-bound and three nucleotide-free monomers, whereas our <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A was incubated with an excess of ATP-analogue AMP-PNP.</p>
        <p>The âheadâ narrows into a tight trimeric neck, 93âÃ across and ~10âÃ long, where the six Lon monomers join into three pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, cross-section 4), forming a narrow, ~15âÃ channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, cross-section 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The COILS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> program predicted that the residues expected to occupy this region, 396â423, are likely to possess a coiled-coil arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Three pairs of legs emerge from this neck in a trimer-of-dimers arrangement, giving rise to signs of a 3-fold symmetry in cross-sections through the N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). They consist of two touching tiered-up globular densities, which could be fitted using residues 1â219 of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Lon N-terminal domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (PDB ID: 3LJC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This trimer-of-dimers configuration corresponds to the arrangements of the AP-domains of the ADP-bound <italic>Mta</italic>Lon and <italic>T. onnurineus</italic> LonB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, which arose because of the presence of low- and high-affinity ATPase sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The resolution of the reconstructed AMP-PNP incubated <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A structure was however not high enough to resolve the structure of the coiled-coil region and assign individual N-terminal domains to their corresponding AP-domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), indeed, the local resolution map of the reconstructed structure shows that the N-terminal domains are its most flexible part (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a similar pair-wise arrangement of the N-terminal helices has also been observed in the hexameric cryo-EM structure of the 26S proteasome ATPase domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and re-projections of the reconstructed <italic>h</italic>Lon structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2</xref>) give rise to the âleggyâ and âleg-lessâ <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Lon particles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>

        <p>The cryo-EM map of <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A at 21âÃ in excess of ADP showed that the barrel-shaped âheadâ adopted an open-ring hexameric conformation, in which six <italic>B. subtilis</italic> AP-domains could be fitted in a lock-washer like configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S2b and S3</xref>). In contrast to the AMP-PNP incubated structure, the curvature of the whole ADP-incubated Lon structure is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie S6</xref>), the two monomers adjacent to the ring opening are axially displaced, and the opening angle between them increased from ~58Â° to ~81Â° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The gate to the catalytic chamber formed by the Ar-Î¦ loops now seems to be open (cross-section 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>), which suggests that ATP hydrolysis by <italic>h</italic>Lon induces conformational changes driving substrate translocation into the catalytic chamber, as observed in the ClpXP proteolytic machine and in the 26S proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and suggested also in the recent study of <italic>Mta</italic>Lon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
        <p>Compared to the <italic>Bs</italic>Lon AP-domain where each of the six monomers had an ADP molecule bound<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, the ring opening in the ADP-incubated <italic>h</italic>Lon structure is smaller by 13Â° and the axial displacement between the two monomers adjacent to the ring opening is smaller (by ~21âÃ). However, the open-ring helical arrangement contrasts to the closed-ring planar arrangement of <italic>Mta</italic>Lonâs AP-domain with three ADPs and three nucleotide-free monomers, which may be a consequence of either a different occupancy of ADP-binding sites or restrictions imposed by crystallization. Considering the planar arrangement of the AMP-PNP incubated <italic>h</italic>Lon structure, it is likely that the lock-washer form of <italic>h</italic>Lonâs AP-domain is a true consequence of ADP binding to a full-length <italic>h</italic>Lon hexamer in physiological conditions. The manifold arrangements of the existing structures of Lonâs AP-domain hexamer document its flexibility, required for its allosteric operations. Lock-washer conformations were also observed in the cryo-EM structures of the D1 ring of the NSF ATPase and in the 26S proteasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>

        <title>Structure and enzymatic activities of the <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 mutant</title>
        <p>In order to study the role of Lonâs N-terminal domain in its activities, we constructed a <italic>h</italic>Lon mutant lacking the first 270 residues, i.e. missing the 114 amino acids of the mitochondrial targeting pre-sequence and the first 156 amino acids of the mature protein. Secondary structure prediction algorithms of <italic>h</italic>Lonâs N-terminal domain indicated that it could be divided into two subdomains separated by an unstructured region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The first subdomain, from the beginning of the protein to around residue 270 (valine), contains many Î²-sheets, while the region after this residue, including also the predicted coiled-coil pattern of the domain linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), is predicted to be predominantly Î±-helical. We found that this shortened <italic>h</italic>Lon still forms a multimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and preserves a small degree of the ATPase and peptidase activities of the full-length protein, but that it has almost no proteolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). During the cryo-EM image analysis of this protein, we encountered a large amount of structural heterogeneity and could not detect any hint of the N-terminal domain in the acquired 2D class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S4 and S5</xref>). In order to interpret the class averages, we compared them to matching projections of crystal structures consisting of five and six 3M6A subunits fitted into the reconstructed ADP-bound S855A mutant (after the conversion of the crystal structures to electron densities) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). We observed features corresponding to the hexameric complex as well as markedly decreased intensities at the expected positions of the sixth subunit, which implies its large flexibility. Therefore, the structure of this shortened <italic>h</italic>Lon mutant is highly variable, which indicates that the first 156 N-terminal amino acids of <italic>h</italic>Lon are crucial for the stability and proper assembly of the <italic>h</italic>Lon hexamer.</p>
        <p>The ATPase and peptidase activities of <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 are much lower than those of the wild type, but they could still be stimulated nearly 2Ã by Î²-casein binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that Î²-casein is still able to bind to <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 and stabilize the formed complex, which then becomes more efficient. However, <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 is almost completely unable to cleave Î²-casein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), even though Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and ATP are present<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and itâs ATPase and proteolytic compartments preserve a significant portion of their functionality. Since the loss of functionality of <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 seems to be linked to its high structural variability, the cleavage of Î²-casein likely requires a cooperation of all six <italic>h</italic>Lon subunits, which supports the recently proposed models of a coordinated substrate translocation proposed in <italic>M. taiwanensis</italic> Lon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and the ClpX unfoldase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this work, we presented the first two structures of a Lon protease in full length, as acquired by cryo-electron microscopy, which show that ATP hydrolysis by human mitochondrial Lon protease induces conformational changes to the whole hexameric complex and stress the important role of its N-terminal domains. In particular, the N-terminal gate to its catalytic chamber appears closed by the axial pore loops when <italic>h</italic>Lon is incubated with AMP-PNP, but opens up at ADP binding. In addition, the <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 mutant lacking the first 156 amino acids could not cleave Î²-casein and its 2D class averages indicated large flexibility of its sixth subunit. Therefore, proper assembly and functioning of the <italic>h</italic>Lon complex are guaranteed only if the first 156 amino acids of <italic>h</italic>Lonâs N-termini domains are present.</p>

The <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 frames were aligned and summed with the GPU-based dosefgpu_driftcorr<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> program prior to further analysis. Image CTFs were estimated by CTFFIND3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, the resolution of our micrographs by the GCTFâs EPA procedure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, which revealed that reliable signal can be extracted from these micrographs up to a resolution, on average, of 6.74âÃ for the S855A-AMP-PNP sample, 8.1âÃ for the S855A-ADP sample, and 4.85âÃ for the frame-aligned <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 specimen. The value of the C<sub>s</sub> coefficient of spherical aberration was set to 0.1 in the processing of the <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 dataset. Particles were picked semi-automatically using the e2boxer program from EMAN2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Altogether, 38100 <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A ADP-incubated particles, 97500 <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A AMP-PNP-incubated particles, and 39800 <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 particles were extracted. The box size was set to 224 pixels for the <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A samples, and to 192 pixels for the <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 specimen.</p>
        <p>The collected particle sets were fully processed in Relion 1.3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. After three runs of 2D classification with 300 classes, 73000 <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A AMP-PNP-incubated particles, 32500 <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A ADP-incubated particles, and 12450 <italic>h</italic>LonÎ270 particles were selected for subsequent 3D classification. Inspection of the resulting 2D class averages of full-length specimens revealed top, side, and tilted views (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1âS3</xref>). Top views were identified according to oligomeric features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, while side and tilted views according to hints of the N-terminal domains.</p>
        <p>In order to create an initial model for the 3D classification of both full-length <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A datasets, the identified side-view class average of the <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A AMP-PNP-incubated specimen was low-pass filtered to 120âÃ and extended to a rotationally symmetric 3D model by rotation of its 2D Fourier transform about its long axis, followed by inverse 3D Fourier transformation. The rotation of the 2D Fourier spectrum was performed by bilinear interpolation between neighboring points of Fourier profiles at each Z-level of the Fourier-transformed side view. All these computations were performed in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).</p>
        <p>In Relion, these initial 3D models were again low-pass filtered to 120âÃ and subjected to grey-scale invariant cross-correlation in the first iteration of the 3D classifications. All 3D classification runs were performed with the initial starting model, and the number of classes in each 3D classification run was selected so that at least one âemptyâ, i.e. very sparsely populated class, resulted.</p>
        <p>The first 3D classification of the <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A AMP-PNP-incubated dataset was performed with 5 classes; 30000 particles from the most populated class were then passed through another classification run with 3 classes. From this 2<sup>nd</sup> run, 23170 particles were selected for final 3D refinement. 3D classification of the <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A ADP-incubated dataset was performed in 3 runs with 6, 3, and 6 classes, respectively. After the 3<sup>rd</sup> run, 10809 particles were available for 3D refinement. In each 3D classification run on the full-length Lon datasets, only those particles contributing to classes with well-formed N-terminal domains were selected for further 3D processing.</p>
        <p>The 3D maps of the major classes acquired from the final 3D classification run were low-pass filtered to 40âÃ and used as initial models for 3D refinement, giving an 18.3âÃ resolution <italic>h</italic>Lon S855AâAMP-PNP structure, and 22.4âÃ <italic>h</italic>Lon S855AâADP structure. The reported resolutions were estimated using Relionâs gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation at the level of 0.143. Both full-length <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A structures were then masked, resulting in a resolution of 15âÃ for the AMP-PNP-incubated structure and 21âÃ for the ADP-incubated structure. Local resolution maps were computed using ResMap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. The handedness of all reconstructions was adjusted to match the orientation of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Lon hexamer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (PDB ID 3M6A).</p>
        <p>In order to check the influence of the starting model on the resulting quaternary structure of the full-length protein, we processed the 23170 <italic>h</italic>Lon S855A AMP-PNP-incubated particles against a synthetic soft-edged cylinder with a length of 220âÃ and a diameter of 140âÃ.

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Crosslinking of wild-type (wt) <italic>h</italic>Lon and its S855A and Î270 mutants. 5âÎ¼g of protein was crosslinked with 0.1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 30âmin on ice and then separated on a 5.5% SDS-PAGE gel. All Lon proteins form oligomeric structures. M: molecular marker. (<bold>b</bold>) Proteolytic activity of wt <italic>h</italic>Lon and its Î270 mutant. 1âÎ¼g of Î²-casein was cleaved by 4âÎ¼g. <italic>h</italic>Lon for 0, 15, and 30âminutes at 37âÂ°C. The reaction mixtures were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The Î270 mutant is proteolytically almost inactive. M: molecular marker. (<bold>c</bold>) ATPase activity of wt <italic>h</italic>Lon and its S855A and Î270 mutants. The triangles (âµ) and circles (âª) show the data for the basal and Î²-casein-stimulated ATPase activity, respectively. The red line corresponds to the wild type, the green to the S855A mutant and blue to the Î270 <italic>h</italic>Lon mutant. It can be seen that the Î270 mutant has a much lower ATPase activity than wt <italic>h</italic>Lon, even lower than the S855A mutant. All three forms still show ATPase stimulation by Î²-casein. (<bold>d</bold>) Peptidase activity of wt <italic>h</italic>Lon and its Î270 mutant. The triangles (âµ) and circles (âª) show the data for the basal and Î²-casein-stimulated peptidase activity, respectively. The red line corresponds to the wt and blue to the Î270 <italic>h</italic>Lon mutant. It can be seen that the Î270 mutant basal activity is about one-third of the wild-type, while its stimulated activity is closer to one half. The S855A mutant has no detectable peptidase activity. (<bold>e</bold>) Protease activity of wild type <italic>h</italic>Lon and its S855A and Î270 mutants. The red line corresponds to the wt and blue to the Î270 <italic>h</italic>Lon mutant protease activity. The <italic>h</italic>Lon Î270 mutant protease activity is very low compared to wt <italic>h</italic>Lon; the S855A mutant has no detectable proteolytic activity.</p>
