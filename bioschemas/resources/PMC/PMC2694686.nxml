      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in the gene encoding tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) cause two seemingly diverse diseases: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) or sarcotubular myopathy (STM) and BardetâBiedl syndrome type 11(BBS11). Although TRIM32 is involved in protein ubiquitination, its substrates and the molecular consequences of disease-causing mutations are poorly understood. In this paper, we show that TRIM32 is a widely expressed ubiquitin ligase that is localized to the Z-line in skeletal muscle. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that TRIM32 binds and ubiquitinates dysbindin, a protein implicated in the genetic aetiology of schizophrenia, augmenting its degradation. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of TRIM32 in myoblasts resulted in elevated levels of dysbindin. Importantly, the LGMD2H/STM-associated TRIM32 mutations, D487N and R394H impair ubiquitin ligase activity towards dysbindin and were mislocalized in heterologous cells. These mutants were able to self-associate and also co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type TRIM32 in transfected cells. Furthermore, the D487N mutant could bind to both dysbindin and its E2 enzyme but was defective in monoubiquitination. In contrast, the BBS11 mutant P130S did not show any biochemical differences compared with the wild-type protein. Our data identify TRIM32 as a regulator of dysbindin and demonstrate that the LGMD2H/STM mutations may impair substrate ubiquitination.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ubiquitinâproteasome system (UPS) is the major pathway responsible for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="DDP167C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Lysine residues within target proteins are modified by covalent attachment of the 8.5 kDa regulatory protein ubiquitin through the sequential action of three ubiquitin ligases: E1, E2 and E3 (<xref rid="DDP167C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Ubiquitin can itself serve as an acceptor for further rounds of ubiquitination, forming a polyubiquitin chain. Lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains are recognized by the proteasome, which rapidly degrades the modified protein. Through its ability to selectively target proteins for destruction, the UPS is involved in all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology and has an important role in degrading misfolded proteins (<xref rid="DDP167C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In humans, there are 68 members of the TRIM protein family that contain the eponymous tripartite motif domains: RING, BBOX and a coiled-coil (<xref rid="DDP167C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Many TRIM proteins have additional and variable C-terminal domains, including the SP1a and the RYanodine receptor (SPRY), NCL-1, HT2A and LIN-41 (NHL) and plant homeodomain (PHD) domains (<xref rid="DDP167C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Despite the prevalence of TRIM genes in the genome, most members of this protein family have poorly defined biological functions. A small number of TRIM family members have been shown to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and have been implicated in different diseases states, such as cancer (<xref rid="DDP167C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="DDP167C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), retroviral restriction (<xref rid="DDP167C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and inherited genetic disease (<xref rid="DDP167C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="DDP167C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), indicating that they have important cellular roles.</p><p>In 2002, Frosk <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) described a mutation, D487N, in the gene encoding tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) as the SPRY cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H). LGMD2H is a mild, autosomal recessive muscle disease that was originally described in the Manitoba Hutterite population (<xref rid="DDP167C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Historically, these patients were described as having sarcotubular myopathy (STM). Clinically, the disease is characterized by moderately elevated serum creatine kinase levels, slowly progressive weakness and wasting of the proximal limb musculature and a relatively late onset in the second or third decade of life. Similarly, MÃ¼ller-Felber <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) described two German patients with a congenital, non-progressive muscle disease with segmental vacuolation of some muscle fibres diagnosed as STM. The muscle biopsies of these patients showed evidence of Z-line streaming, dilation of the sarcotubular system, autophagic double-membraned vacuoles and an increased number of centrally located myonuclei. Although STM has an earlier onset and is clinically more severe than LGMD2H, the same D487N mutation has been shown to cause both disorders suggesting that the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous (<xref rid="DDP167C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This mutation resides in the third NHL repeat of TRIM32 (<xref rid="DDP167C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These repeats are thought to fold into a six-bladed Î²-propeller structure (<xref rid="DDP167C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Studies on proteins such as Brat and malin have shown that the NHL repeats mediate proteinâprotein interactions (<xref rid="DDP167C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="DDP167C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Three additional mutations in the first (R394H), fourth (T520TfsX13) and fifth (D588del) NHL repeats of TRIM32 were also found to cause LGMD2H in non-Hutterite populations (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Interestingly, this study also identified one patient with LGMD2H attributable to heterozygous mutation R394H/+ in the <italic>TRIM32</italic> gene (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Recently, a mouse model of LGMD2H/STM has been described that recapitulates many of the features in the LGMD2H/STM in humans (<xref rid="DDP167C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, in addition to muscular dystrophy, these mice also have evidence of neurological involvement that may contribute to some of the myopathic changes observed in their muscles. These changes have been attributed in part to decreased levels of neurofilaments in <italic>Trim32</italic> knockout mice concomitant with a reduction in the diameter of myelinated motor axons (<xref rid="DDP167C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, a missense mutation P130S, in the BBOX domain of TRIM32, causes BardetâBiedl syndrome type 11 (BBS11) (<xref rid="DDP167C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). BBS is a complex condition associated with obesity, retinal degeneration, genito-urinary tract malformations and cognitive impairment (<xref rid="DDP167C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Furthermore, BBS appears to be associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric and behavioural abnormalities (<xref rid="DDP167C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In mammals, the majority of the BBS proteins participate in the formation of the primary cilium and exist in a 450 kDa multiprotein complex, termed the BBSsome (<xref rid="DDP167C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In addition to their role in ciliogenesis, BBS proteins participate in a number of signalling pathways and may have a more general role in vesicular trafficking and movement of intracellular organelles such as melanosomes (<xref rid="DDP167C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Intriguingly, no muscle abnormality is found in BBS patients, suggesting different aspects of TRIM32 function are disrupted by the LGMD2H mutations.</p><p>Although TRIM32 is thought to be involved in protein ubiquitination, its precise physiological role in muscle is unknown (<xref rid="DDP167C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). A recent report investigating the role of TRIM32 in muscle demonstrated that TRIM32 binds to myosin IIA and ubiquitinates actin <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="DDP167C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This study also concluded that TRIM32âD487N behaved like the wild-type protein with respect to its ability to monoubiquitinate actin. In a separate study, Saccone <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) have reported that the D487N mutation impairs both self-association and E2-binding in yeast. Paradoxically, this defect would be predicted to drastically impair substrate ubiquitination.</p><p>In addition to its role in genetic disease, TRIM32 is up-regulated in epidermal carcinogenesis, where it is thought to increase keratinocyte survival by blocking ultraviolet light B (UVB)-induced tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) apoptotic signalling (<xref rid="DDP167C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This effect was later shown to be mediated through TRIM32 ubiquitination and destabilization of a pro-apoptotic SUMO-E3 ubiquitin ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT Y (PIASy) which exhibited altered intracellular distribution in response to UVB/TNFÎ±-treatment (<xref rid="DDP167C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Whether PIASy is a substrate of TRIM32 in muscle under normal conditions has yet to be determined.</p><p>The aim of this study was to elucidate the cellular role of TRIM32 and to investigate how <italic>TRIM32</italic> mutations might alter the function of the protein. We have found that TRIM32 is able to bind and ubiquitinate dysbindin, a protein involved in endosomalâlysosomal trafficking and the genetic aetiology of schizophrenia (<xref rid="DDP167C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The LGMD2H/STM mutants have impaired ubiquitin ligase activity, were mislocalized in heterologous cells but were able to self-associate. Furthermore, the common D487N mutant was able to bind to its E2 enzyme but was not monoubiquitinated under basal conditions. In contrast, no biochemical differences between wild-type TRIM32 and the BBS11-associated P130S mutant were found. Our data suggest that TRIM32 may be a regulator of dysbindin and highlight important functional differences between wild-type TRIM32 and the LGMD2H/STM mutants D487N and R394H.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TRIM32 can ubiquitinate dysbindin in heterologous cells</title><p>TRIM32 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of several distinct domains (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>A). Mutations associated with muscle disease cluster within the NHL repeats, whereas the BBS11 mutation is found in the BBOX domain (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>A). The yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H) was used to identify potential TRIM32-interacing proteins from a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. This screen isolated three independent full-length clones encoding the protein dysbindin. Subsequently, we used the Y2H system to determine whether the D487N (LGMD2H) and P130S (BBS11) mutants, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, could interact with dysbindin. In yeast, the LGMD2H mutant TRIM32âD487N failed to interact with dysbindin, whereas a robust interaction between TRIM32âP130S and dysbindin was found (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>B). To ensure that the TRIM32-, D487N- and P130S-LexA fusion proteins were being expressed at comparable levels, protein extracts were prepared from each yeast strain and analysed by western blot using the anti-TRIM32 antibody (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>C). Characterization of the anti-TRIM32 antibody is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp167/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>A. Each protein was produced at similar levels in yeast suggesting that the lack of interaction between the LGMD mutant and dysbindin did not result from reduced expression of the LGMD mutant bait plasmid.</p><fig id="DDP167F1" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 1.</label><caption><p>Dysbindin interacts with TRIM32 in yeast and <italic>in vivo</italic>.

(<bold>B</bold>) TRIM32, D487N and P130S bait strains were co-transformed with empty prey plasmid (pYesTrp2) or dysbindin prey plasmid. The double transformants were tested for histidine auxotrophy.

(<bold>E</bold>) Dysbindin is polyubiquitinated by TRIM32. Myc-dysbindin was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells expressing HA-ubiquitin and either TRIM32, D487N, P130S, R394H or RING-mut. Immunoprecipitated dysbindin was probed for the presence of conjugated HA-ubiquitin by western blot. A high molecular weight smear is seen on the HA blot indicative of polyubiquitination. As expected, the RING mutant is unable to ubiquitinate dysbindin. Interestingly, D487N and R394H have impaired ubiquitin ligase activity towards dysbindin, exemplified by the weaker smearing on the HA blot. (<bold>F</bold>) Effect of TRIM32 on the ubiquitination of PIASy. The ubiquitination of PIASy was assessed under identical condition to those for dysbindin as shown in (E). Co-expression of TRIM32 or TRIM32âD487N had no apparent effect upon the ubiquitination of PIASy. Note that PIASy is modified by endogenous ubiquitin ligases when expressed in HEK293T cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp16701"/></fig><p>To confirm the interaction between TRIM32 and dysbindin in mammalian cells, myc-tagged TRIM32 (and mutants thereof) and dysbindin were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. TRIM32 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using the anti-myc 9E10 antibody. The immune complexes were immunoblotted and probed for the presence of dysbindin using the anti-dysbindin antibody PA3111A (<xref rid="DDP167C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>D shows that wild-type TRIM32 and all of the mutants [D487N, P130S and RING mutant (RING-mut)] could co-immunoprecipitate with dysbindin from HEK293T cell extracts.</p><p>To determine whether TRIM32 could act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for dysbindin, various combinations of expression constructs encoding TRIM32, TRIM32âD487N, TRIMâP130S, TRIM32âRING-mut, myc-dysbindin and haemaglutinin (HA)-ubiquitin were transfected in to HEK293T cells. In addition to the aforementioned mutants, we also included a second LGMD2H mutant R394H, which was recently found in two patients from Southern Italy (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The RING-mut construct was produced by site-directed mutagenesis changing three conserved Zn<sup>2+</sup>-co-ordinating residues (C21, C40 and H42) in the RING domain to alanine. These mutations were predicted to impair the activity of TRIM32 as an ubiquitin ligase. Transfected cells were lysed under denaturing and reducing conditions (1% SDS, 10 m<sc>m</sc> DTT) to prevent polyubiquitinated proteins co-immunoprecipitating with dysbindin. Myc-dysbindin was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts using the 9E10 antibody. Ubiquitinated dysbindin was identified by immunoblotting immunoprecipitated myc-dysbindin with the anti-HA antibody. A band corresponding to monoubiquitinated dysbindin is detected with both the anti-myc and the anti-HA antibodies when wild-type TRIM32 is co-expressed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>E). The anti-HA-ubiquitin blot also detects high molecular weight smearing indicative of polyubiquitination. This smearing is present in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both wild-type TRIM32 and the P130S mutant. Interestingly, the intensity of the polyubiquitin smearing was markedly reduced for the LGMD2H/STM-associated D487N and R394H mutants, suggesting that these mutations are associated with impaired ubiquitin ligase activity. As expected, mutation of the RING domain abolished ubiquitination of dysbindin demonstrating that this ubiquitination was solely due to the function of TRIM32 and not endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligases. To negate the possibility that the impaired ubiquitin ligase activity of the D487N and RING-mut was due to the inherent instability of the protein in transfected cells, we determined the half-lives of each protein. Wild-type TRIM32 and the D487N mutant have very similar half-lives (17.7 and 18.5 h, respectively), whereas P130S and the RING-mut were slightly more stable (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp167/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>).</p><p>In control experiments, we performed the identical ubiquitination assays using myc-PIASy instead of myc-dysbindin. PIASy is polyubiquitinated by endogenous E3 ligases in HEK293T cells in the absence of TRIM32. This ubiquitination does not increase in the presence of TRIM32 expression (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>F). As suggested by Albor <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), one possible explanation for this finding is that PIASy translocation from the nucleus occurs only under UVB/TNFÎ±/MG132 treatment, which then permits TRIM32 to modify PIASy. Without eliciting a stress response, PIASy and TRIM32 are in different subcellular compartments, where interaction and ubiquitination would be unlikely to occur (see below and Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F2">2</xref>A).</p><fig id="DDP167F2" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 2.</label><caption><p>Localization of TRIM32 and dysbindin in skeletal muscle.

Following fixation, the cells were stained for dysbindin and analysed by confocal microscopy. In agreement with previous reports, TRIM32âEYFP is seen as cytoplasmic speckles (sometimes referred to as cytoplasmic bodies), often located around the nucleus (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F3">3</xref>A). The size and number of the TRIM32 speckles were dependent on the expression level of the protein, similar to TRIM5Î± cytoplasmic bodies (<xref rid="DDP167C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Cells expressing low levels of TRIM32 had a greater number of cytoplasmic bodies with lower fluorescence intensity, whereas in the cells expressing higher amounts of TRIM32, the cytoplasmic speckles appear to coalesce to form larger aggregates that were fewer in number. These cytoplasmic speckles were also immunoreactive for ubiquitinated proteins detected with the anti-FK1 monoclonal antibody (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F3">3</xref>B).

Protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide and samples were taken every 5 h. The levels of protein remaining at each time point were determined by quantitative western blotting. FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F4">4</xref> shows that the presence of TRIM32 had a destabilising effect on dysbindin compared with the ubiquitination-defective RING-mut (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F4">4</xref>B).

It is possible that these bands represent dysbindin breakdown products. Since the RING-mut is able to bind (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F1">1</xref>C), but not ubiquitinate dysbindin, we conclude that polyubiquitination of dysbindin by wild-type TRIM32 augments its degradation.</p><fig id="DDP167F4" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 4.</label><caption><p>TRIM32 targets dysbindin for degradation.

Dysbindin ubiquitination was assessed with the anti-HA antibody as described above. In each reaction, dysbindin is clearly polyubiquitinated by each combination of TRIM32 and mutant. However in extracts from cells expressing myc-TRIM32 and R394HâEYFP, we consistently found a reduction in the levels of the monoubiquitinated form of dysbindin (asterisk). This change was also detected with the anti-dysbindin antibody (asterisk).

Having found that a wild-type protein was able to interact with a mutant albeit in heterologous cells, we tested the ability of the D487N and R394H mutants to ubiquitinate dysbindin in the presence of wild-type TRIM32. These experiments were performed as described above; however, each transfection was spiked with 0.5 Âµg of a plasmid encoding TRIM32âEYFP, D487NâEYFP, R394HâEYFP or RING-mutâEYFP. Each condition was compared with the ubiquitination-defective RING-mut, since this would represent a mixture of an active and inactive ubiquitin ligase (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F5">5</xref>E). Although no gross differences in dysbindin ubiquitination were observed, it is notable that the levels of monoubiquitinated dysbindin were reduced when TRIM32 was co-expressed with the R394H mutant (asterisks in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F5">5</xref>E). This result was found in three separate experiments and may reflect the ability of the R394H mutant to attenuate the activity of wild-type TRIM32. Finally, we co-expressed the EYFP-tagged LGMD2H/STM mutants and wild-type TRIM32 in COS-7 cells to determine whether co-expression of TRIM32 could alter the cytoplasmic distribution of the mutants that was reported above (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F3">3</xref>B).

We used a direct biochemical approach to assay the basal ubiquitination status of TRIM32 and each of the mutants. Myc-TRIM32 and each of the mutants were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. The cells were lysed under denaturing and reducing conditions, and myc-TRIM32 was purified using immunoaffinity chromatography from cell lysates using 9E10-conjugated Protein G Sepharose beads. Affinity purified myc-TRIM32 was separated by gel electrophoresis and stained with colloidal Coomassie blue. A strong 72 kDa band corresponding to TRIM32 is present at similar amounts in all lanes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F7">7</xref>).

In addition to TRIM32, band A1 yielded multiple peptides obtained from ubiquitin (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F7">7</xref>). We therefore concluded that the upper band represents monoubiquitinated TRIM32 and that D487N and the RING-mut fail to gain this modification.

Dysbindin and TRIM32 were both found at the Z-line in skeletal muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, Z-line streaming is a pathological feature of many muscle diseases including LGMD2H/STM and was also a found in the mouse <italic>Trim32</italic> knockout (<xref rid="DDP167C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Although no direct link between dysbindin, BLOC-1 and muscle disease has been established, dysbindin is known to participate in the trafficking of proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles including some lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs) (<xref rid="DDP167C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Interestingly, mutations in LAMP-2 cause Danon disease, a complex lysosomal myopathy associated with the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in myofibres and impaired lysosomal function (<xref rid="DDP167C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our data could implicate TRIM32 in the regulation of trafficking in the lysosomalâendosomal pathway in muscle through the ubiquitination of proteins such as dysbindin.</p><p>Mutations in the human dysbindin gene, <italic>DTNBP1</italic>, cause a complex, hypo-pigmentation and bleeding disorder characterized by defects in the formation of lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes and platelet-dense granules (<xref rid="DDP167C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). A defect in lysosomalâendosomal trafficking may explain recent evidence linking dysbindin to the psychiatric disorder schizophrenia (<xref rid="DDP167C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). A plethora of genetic studies have linked <italic>DTNBP1</italic> variants to an increased susceptibility to develop schizophrenia (<xref rid="DDP167C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, Talbot <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) found that dysbindin protein levels are reduced in the hippocampal formation of schizophrenics relative to age-matched control. In light of these studies, it is important to consider that TRIM32-mediated dysbindin ubiquitination may have a regulatory role, affecting protein trafficking to endosomes or recycling. These processes are often regulated by monoubiquitination and K63-linked polyubiquitination (<xref rid="DDP167C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). A role for TRIM32 in atypical ubiquitination is further supported by the study of Saccone <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) who showed that the ubiquitin ligase E2N, which normally participates in the formation of lysine-63 linked polyubiquitin chains, may act as an E2 enzyme for TRIM32.</p><p>Using several complimentary techniques, we have demonstrated that the LGMD2H/STM-associated D487N and R394H mutations abrogate the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM32. In common with wild-type TRIM32, the D487N could bind to UbcM3 consistent with current evidence showing that the RING domain is the main determinant in E2 recruitment (<xref rid="DDP167C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Since D487N is able to bind dysbindin, it is possible that the reduced ubiquitin ligase activity of D487N results from disruption in protein interactions with other components of the ubiquitinâproteasome pathway, and suggests that the NHL domain is not essential for substrate binding in this instance. This defect could also be linked to the altered distribution seen for D487NâEYFP and R394HâEYFP in transfected cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F3">3</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp167/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>) and the impaired monoubiquitination of D487N (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F7">7</xref>). Since mutations of the RING domain also resulted in impaired monoubiquitination, it is likely that this represents an âauto-monoubiquitinationâ event that may have a regulatory role.</p><p>Molecular modelling of the NHL repeats of TRIM32 suggested that LGMD2H mutations significantly disrupt the Î²-propeller structure of the NHL domain (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This structural malformation is likely to have a substantial role in the altered subcellular distribution and function of the LGMD mutant. In mammalian cells, we found that wild-type and mutant TRIM32 could self-associate, whereas in yeast, the D487N and R394H mutants were unable to transactivate expression of the reporter genes. Since the D487N and R394H mutants can ubiquitinate dysbindin, albeit to a lesser extent, it follows that D487N and R394H should be able to bind to dysbindin. Although we have not used formal biophysical methods to show direct binding between dysbindin and TRIM32 in mammalian cells, our data indicate that the mutants D487N and R394H are able to associate with dysbindin either directly or via an intermediate protein (another TRIM or TRIM-related protein) co-immunoprecipitating from transfected cells. It should be noted that neither TRIM32 nor dysbindin is present in yeast cells suggesting that their interaction in the Y2H is direct and not mediated by a third protein. Our findings are similar to those of Gentry <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), who found that mutations in the NHL domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase malin (which causes a form of myoclonus epilepsy) completely abolished its interaction with laforin (the substrate of malin) in the Y2H system. Despite this, both proteins co-immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells, with the NHL mutations significantly impairing the ubiquitin ligase activity of malin towards laforin (<xref rid="DDP167C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the self-association properties of TRIM32, we have also found that wild-type TRIM32 and the LGMD2H/STM mutants co-localized and co-immunoprecipitate from cells expressing both proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp167/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link> and Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F5">5</xref>D). In the case of the R394H mutant, co-expression with wild-type TRIM32 reduced the level of dysbindin monoubiquitination potentially indicating that this mutation may compromise the function of the wild-type protein (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP167F5">5</xref>E). Interestingly, Saccone <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found one LGMD2H patient that was heterozygous for the R394H mutation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that an interaction between wild-type and mutant TRIM32 may cause late onset LGMD2H in this patient.</p><p>It is striking that all four LGMD2H/STM mutations cluster within the NHL repeats of TRIM32, yet none of the patients presented with symptoms of BBS11 and vice versa. BBS11 is a complex disorder that is associated with an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric disease. For example, BBS patients are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia compared with the general population, leading to the suggestion that BBS genes may themselves be candidate schizophrenia susceptibility genes (<xref rid="DDP167C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Indeed, recent data suggest disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 forms a complex with BBS4 and pericentriolar material 1 protein at the centrosome, where a number of other BBS proteins have been found to localize (<xref rid="DDP167C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Here, BBS proteins are thought to be involved in the assembly and function of primary cilia by regulating intracellular transport (<xref rid="DDP167C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Although TRIM32 has not been localized to primary cilia, knockdown of TRIM32 in zebrafish results in defective melanosome transport (<xref rid="DDP167C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Our findings are therefore of particular interest, since we have characterized a second interaction between a BBS gene and a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, both of which appear to have roles in intracellular trafficking. Some genetic variants in the <italic>DTNBP1</italic> gene influence cognitive performance in the general population and are also associated with cognitive decline in schizophrenia (<xref rid="DDP167C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="DDP167C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). It is therefore interesting to speculate that the interaction between TRIM32 and dysbindin may play role in the cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in some BBS patients. Although the BBS11 mutation P130S was not defective in dysbindin ubiquitination, these data may suggest that the P130S mutation disrupts as yet unidentified aspects of the protein function not affected by TRIM32 mutations associated with LGMD2H/STM. In support of this, Chiang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="DDP167C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) found that unlike P130S, D487N could rescue TRIM32 knockdown BBS phenotypes in zebrafish.</p><p>In summary, we have identified several functional differences between wild-type and LGMD2H/STM-mutated TRIM32. These differences affect the localization and potential regulation of TRIM32 and lead to impaired ubiquitination of substrates such as dysbindin that we have identified herein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Y2H screening</title><p>Y2H screening was performed using the Hybrid Hunter system (Invitrogen).
