    <p id="P2">Initiation of left-right asymmetry involves the generation of leftward fluid flow by motile cilia of the embryonic node, leading to activation of the conserved <italic>NODAL</italic> gene expression cascade in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and ultimately to the asymmetric positioning of the heart and other visceral organs<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Heterotaxy (or situs ambiguus) comprises abnormal left-right positioning of visceral organs<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, falls between the two extremes of situs solitus (normal) and situs inversus (complete mirror image version of normal) and is often associated with complex congenital heart defects (CHDs)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Laterality defects (ie, heterotaxy and situs inversus) have an estimated prevalence of 1.1/10,000 live births<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and account for approximately 3% of all CHDs<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Situs inversus can occur in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; OMIM 244400), caused by mutations in structural components of motile cilia. Genes implicated in isolated heterotaxy include components of the <italic>NODAL</italic> pathway and <italic>ZIC3</italic> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), however these genes account for only a small proportion of cases.</p>
    <p id="P3">We investigated two non-consanguineous families with recurrent heterotaxy including CHDs, but without any obvious symptoms of ciliopathy. Family 1 consists of affected dizygotic twins, one of whom died at one day of life due to haemodynamic failure, while family 2 consists of two affected brothers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and for family 2 see reference<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>). Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the affected twins of family 1 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) led to the identification of rare, compound heterozygous mutations in matrix metallopeptidase 21 (<italic>MMP21</italic>, NM_147191.1): c.677T&gt;C, p.(Ile226Thr) and c.1203G&gt;A, p.(Trp401*); the latter corresponding to rs137955225 with Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) allele frequency &lt; 1/30,000. No rare, damaging variants were identified in genes previously implicated in isolated heterotaxy (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Point mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis indicated recessive inheritance (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Based on previous whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the family 2 affected brothers and their healthy parents, compound heterozygous missense variants in <italic>BCL9L</italic> were suggested as potentially pathogenic<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, however both <italic>BCL9L</italic> variants in that family are predicted benign and neutral by Polyphen2 and Provean programs respectively, and left-right patterning defects have not been reported in <italic>Bcl9l</italic> knockout mice or morphant zebrafish<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Re-analysis of the family 2 WGS data for identification of structural variants revealed compound heterozygosity in both brothers for a deletion of <italic>MMP21</italic> exons 1-3 (chr10:127,460,915-127,466,819; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) inherited from the mother and a frameshift mutation in <italic>MMP21</italic> (c.365delT, p.(Met122Serfs*55)) inherited from the father. The heterozygous exonic deletion was validated by microarray analysis, and breakpoints were verified by long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing.</p>
    <p id="P4">Subsequently we sequenced <italic>MMP21</italic> following HaloPlex target enrichment in 264 index cases with either heterotaxy (extra-cardiac and/or cardiac laterality defects such as dextrocardia or transposition of the great arteries (TGA), n=154) or non-heterotaxy CHDs such as isolated tetralogy of Fallot or common arterial trunk (n=110). The total included 25 syndromic cases in which heterotaxy or CHDs were associated with one or more other anomalies (for example, anal atresia, vertebral anomalies or cleft palate), and was comprised of 117 familial and 147 sporadic cases, including 34 index cases born to consanguineous parents. We identified nine cases (families 3-11) with rare, biallelic <italic>MMP21</italic> variations predicted to affect protein function; all variations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with heterotaxy or other laterality defects and complex CHDs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, Supplementary Tables 2 and 4</xref>). For families 10 and 11, one of the variants has been reported in the ExAC database in the homozygous state; the <italic>MMP21</italic> variants are therefore unlikely to be causal in those cases. In families 3-9, all variants identified have ExAC allele frequencies &lt;1/10,000 and have not been reported as homozygous. All missense variants (except p.(Arg408Gly)) were predicted probably damaging and deleterious by Polyphen2 and Provean, respectively (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Parametric genome-wide linkage analysis performed on families 6 and 7 (analysed simultaneously) demonstrated a linkage peak with LOD score of 3.508 on a region of chromosome 10 containing <italic>MMP21</italic> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>); no other genes in the interval are known to cause laterality disorders (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Also, homozygosity mapping in family 7 indicated that <italic>MMP21</italic> fell within a large region of homozygosity shared by the two affected individuals (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Five families were consanguineous (families 3, 5-8). Of the three family 8 individuals with a homozygous <italic>MMP21</italic> variant, F8-III:9 had situs inversus totalis while F8-III:3 is reported to be asymptomatic, suggesting possible incomplete penetrance in this family (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Overall, the penetrance of laterality defects in our series is very high compared to that observed in PCD (~50%). Based on the above findings, <italic>MMP21</italic> mutations account for 5.9 % of non-syndromic heterotaxy cases.</p>
    <p id="P5">MMP21 is predicted to be secreted and conforms to the basic domain structure of MMPs<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>: an N-terminal signal peptide, an auto-inhibitory pro-domain, a catalytic peptidase domain and four C-terminal hemopexin repeats that are involved in substrate recognition (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Mapping of the affected MMP21 peptidase domain residues Glu215, Ile226 and Ala321 to a model based on the crystal structure of the MMP11 peptidase domain indicated that all three fall within core secondary structure components (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>); their substitutions may therefore destabilize the domain. The variants p.(Arg360Cys), p.(Arg375His) and p.(Arg408Gly) map to the first and fourth hemopexin domains and therefore may influence substrate specificity.</p>
    <p id="P6">Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for <italic>mmp21</italic> in zebrafish embryos at stages during which left-right asymmetry is established indicated that expression was restricted to Kupfferâs vesicle (the left-right organizer in fish; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-e</xref>). Injection of splice-blocking (MO1; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>) or translation-blocking (MO-AUG) <italic>mmp21</italic> morpholinos, but not standard control or 5 base mispair morpholinos, resulted in randomized heart looping in zebrafish at 48 hpf (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f,g</xref>). Defects in other organs known to be dependent on ciliary function were not observed (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), confirming a highly specialized role for <italic>mmp21</italic> in the generation of left-right asymmetry.</p>
    <p id="P7">Consistent with the above findings, two ENU-induced <italic>Mmp21</italic> missense mutations cause laterality defects and complex CHDs in mice<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 7,8,9</xref> and accompanying manuscript by Akawi et al). We performed CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-editing in mouse zygotes to knock-in the <italic>MMP21</italic> p.(Ile226Thr) or p.(Ala321Pro) missense mutations from family 1 and 6. We harvested 49 F0 embryos at E13.5 and observed mutations (including deletions and insertions) in <italic>Mmp21</italic> in 15/15 (100%) embryos and 20/34 (59%) embryos injected with p.(Ile226Thr) or p.(Ala321Pro) oligos, respectively (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8 and Supplementary Tables 10 and 11</xref>). Phenotyping showed 97% of the mutation-positive embryos (32/33; not included are two mutation-positive dead embryos whose phenotype could not be analysed) had CHDs including TGA, with 20 (61%) exhibiting situs inversus or heterotaxy and 13 (39%) exhibiting situs solitus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). No defects were observed in 14 embryos with wildtype genotypes and in one mutation-positive embryo (A321P-20). Subcloning of PCR products amplified from yolk sac genomic DNA revealed that embryo I226T-1 harboured a loss of function deletion on one allele and on the other the desired A to G mutation causing the homologous p.(Ile226Thr) substitution (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8 and Supplementary Table 11</xref>). This embryo exhibited situs inversus with CHD (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 10</xref>), while embryos I226T-4 and -5 also harboured laterality defects and CHDs and had a high abundance of subclones with the knock-in allele (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 11</xref>), supporting the pathogenicity of the p.(Ile226Thr) missense mutation. No p.(Ala321Pro) knock-in alleles were identified. The above findings show that <italic>Mmp21</italic> loss of function can cause the same spectrum of phenotypes seen in mice with ENU-induced missense mutations, suggesting that the latter are loss of function.</p>
    <p id="P8">Specific ECM molecules play various roles at the node during left-right patterning<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, suggesting candidate MMP21 cleavage targets. Also, relevant to the central role of TGFÎ² family members (e.g. NODAL, LEFTY) in generation of left-right asymmetry, MMPs can activate latent TGFÎ² factors<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Important future work will involve investigation of MMP21 cleavage targets at the node. Interestingly, an <italic>MMP21</italic> orthologue appears to be either absent or undergoing decay in genomes of birds, reptiles and cetartiodactyl mammals (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 9-11</xref>). It has been reported that in chick and pig (a cetartiodactyl), cells of the embryonic node are covered by endoderm, such that asymmetry would be established by rotational cell movements around the node rather than by cilia-driven fluid flow<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. We speculate that <italic>MMP21</italic> is only required in those species in which asymmetry depends on ciliated nodal cells exposed to an extracellular cavity.</p>
    <p id="P9">In conclusion, our results suggest that <italic>MMP21</italic> plays an essential role in the pathway specifying left-right asymmetry by providing a highly specific cleavage activity at the embryonic node, and that <italic>MMP21</italic> mutations are a relatively frequent cause of heterotaxy in humans.</p>

Stained embryos were photographed in 30% sucrose and then cryosectioned. An <italic>mmp21</italic> cDNA containing the entire ORF was also amplified using the primers 5âF and 3âR above. This sequence has been deposited in GenBank, with accession number KT207790.</p>
