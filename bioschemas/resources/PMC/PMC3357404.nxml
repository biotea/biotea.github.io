      <abstract>
        <p>The TRIM family of proteins is distinguished by its <underline>tri</underline>partite <underline>m</underline>otif (TRIM). Typically, TRIM proteins contain a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil domain and the more variable C-terminal domains. TRIM16 does not have a RING domain but does harbour two B-box domains. Here we showed that TRIM16 homodimerized through its coiled-coil domain and heterodimerized with other TRIM family members; TRIM24, Promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein and Midline-1 (MID1). Although, TRIM16 has no classic RING domain, three-dimensional modelling of TRIM16 suggested that its B-box domains adopts RING-like folds leading to the hypothesis that TRIM16 acts as an ubiquitin ligase. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrated that TRIM16, devoid of a classical RING domain had auto-polyubiquitination activity and acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro assays</italic>. Thus via its unique structure, TRIM16 possesses both heterodimerization function with other TRIM proteins and also has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The <underline>tri</underline>partite <underline>m</underline>otif (TRIM)/Ring finger, B box, coiled-coil (RBCC) family of proteins are defined by the presence of the tripartite motif. The TRIM protein family is composed of more than 70 highly conserved proteins which have been implicated in a diverse range of biological processes including development, cell growth, differentiation, innate immune functions and cancer <xref rid="pone.0037470-Joazeiro1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Meroni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. One poorly characterized member of this family is TRIM16. TRIM16 or estrogen-responsive B box protein (EBBP) is a positive transcriptional regulator of the retinoic acid receptor Î²<sub>2</sub> (RARÎ²<sub>2</sub>) gene <xref rid="pone.0037470-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Raif1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. TRIM16 overexpression also enhances retinoid-induced differentiation, reduces neuroblastoma cell growth, migration, and significantly reduces tumorigenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0037470-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Typically, TRIM proteins contain a <underline>R</underline>eally <underline>I</underline>nteresting <underline>N</underline>ew <underline>G</underline>ene (RING) finger domain, one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil domain and the more variable C-terminal domains. The RING and B-box domains are both cysteine-rich and bind zinc atoms, indicating possible interactions with proteins, DNA and RNA. The RING domain has E3 ubiquitin-ligase potential and can transfer ubiquitin to RING proteins as well as heterologous substrates <xref rid="pone.0037470-Joazeiro1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Meroni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, little is known about the function of B-box domains, although they occur widely in nature. Recently, the first solved structure of a B-box domain displays a structure similar to a RING domain, suggesting these domains evolved from a common ancestor <xref rid="pone.0037470-Massiah1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Massiah2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. TRIM16 does not have a RING domain but does harbour two B-box domains, leading to the hypotheses that TRIM16 has RING-like domains and functions as an ubiquitin ligase. TRIM16âs C-terminus contains an RFP-like or B30.2/SPRY (B30.2) domain.</p>
      <p>Several members of the TRIM protein family are known to homodimerize and heterodomerize with other TRIMs, and the coiled-coil domain is generally required for these functional associations <xref rid="pone.0037470-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Reymond1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this study, we show that TRIM16 can homodimerize through its coiled-coil domain but also bind to other TRIM proteins; Midline-1 (MID-1/TRIM18), Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML/TRIM19) and TRIM24 (TIF-1Î±). Additionally, our molecular modelling of TRIM16âs B-boxes suggests zinc binding capability and we present evidence that B-box domains have ubiquitination capability, leading to the suggestion that other B-box-containing proteins may perform a similar function.</p>

        <title>TRIM16 Homodimerizes via Its Coiled-Coil Domain</title>
        <p>In the large and evolutionary conserved TRIM family, specific domains tend to operate as functional units. Many TRIM proteins homodimerize via their coiled-coil domains <xref rid="pone.0037470-Meroni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Reymond1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. To further investigate the function of TRIM16, we tested whether TRIM16 is able to homodimerize. Two differently tagged TRIM16 expression vectors and 5 different deletion mutants of TRIM16 were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g001">Figure 1A</xref>); TRIM16-GFP and TRIM16-myc-his with both tags being fused separately to the C-terminus of the TRIM16 protein. The full-length TRIM16 and 5 deletion constructs were used to probe for the role of various domains in protein function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). HEK293 cells were co-transfected either empty vector pCMV6-AC-GFP and TRIM16-GFP or empty vector (EV) pCDNA-myc-His and TRIM16-myc-His. Immunoprecipitation of the myc-tag strongly indicated that TRIM16-GFP and TRIM16-myc-His were homodimerizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed these results by using the anti-GFP antibody (Ab) for immunoprecipitation, and investigating whether GFP-tagged deletion mutants of TRIM16 were able to retain homodimerization with the TRIM16-myc-His. GFP fusion mutants bearing coiled-coil domains (mutant 1, 3 and 5) were able to homodimerize with the TRIM16-myc-His protein, indicating this region is required for TRIM16 homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g001">Figure 1C and 1A</xref>). However a weak band (Lane 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) indicates that B-boxes are able to form some homodimers to a lesser extent.</p>

        <title>TRIM16 Heterodimerizes with MID1, TRIM24 and PML</title>
        <p>TRIM proteins have been shown to interact with other TRIM family members. For example, TRIM24 is known to bind PML <xref rid="pone.0037470-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and RET finger protein (RFP/TRIM27) through the B-box and coiled-coil domains <xref rid="pone.0037470-Cao2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore it was important to establish whether TRIM16 may also form hetero-complexes. PML, TRIM24 and MID1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) have E3-ligase ability through their RING domain and generally homo/heterodimerize through their coiled-coil domains <xref rid="pone.0037470-Meroni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Reymond1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. To determine whether MID1 could interact with TRIM16, we performed co-transfection of MID1-GFP and TRIM16-myc-His in HEK293 cells and subsequent performed immunoprecipitation by anti-myc antibody and western blot with anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that TRIM16 and MID1 formed a complex in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The specificity of this interaction was validated by MID1 immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP tag antibody and Western blot analyzed by myc-tag antibody, probing for TRIM16-myc-His (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The interaction with MID1 suggested that TRIM16 may have a function in the cytoskeleton, as MID1 associates with the microtubules and the cytoskeleton <xref rid="pone.0037470-ArandaOrgilles1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

TRIM16-GFP was immunoprecipitated via its GFP tag, and the resulting associating proteins were subjected to western blot and probed for PML (anti-PML antibody) or TRIM24-His (anti-His antibody). In addition to the interaction observed with MID1, the interactions with TRIM24 and PML proteins demonstrate that TRIM16 is able to heterodimerise with at least three different classes of TRIM proteins.</p>
        <p>TRIM16 is known to bind the promoter region of the RARÎ² gene <xref rid="pone.0037470-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, TRIM24, also a transcription factor, has been shown to act in a complex with PML and the RARÎ± and RXR receptors, which are known to bind the same promoter region sequence of RARÎ² as TRIM16 <xref rid="pone.0037470-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Gronemeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. PML is a tumour suppressor which has a significant role in the cell-cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. PML is required for the formation of large protein complexes called PML-bodies which are believed to have a role in transcription. PML and TRIM24 do not possess a B30.2 domain which suggests TRIM16âs heterodimerization is through the other domains on these proteins.</p>

        <title>TRIM16âs B-Boxes Possess RING-Like Folds</title>
        <p>The solution structure of MID1âs B-boxes reveals they adopt RING-like folds with a modelled capacity for zinc-binding and possibly ubiquitination activity <xref rid="pone.0037470-Massiah2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037470-Tao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We hypothesized that the B-boxes of TRIM16 also have RING-like folds. An amino acid sequence alignment of the human MID1 sequence with TRIM16 from various species was performed (Sim, ExPASy, CA). There was 46% sequence identity between the human B-box1 sequences of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). TRIM16 shares the zinc binding consensus sequence to MID1 with the exception of the 6<sup>th</sup> cysteine residue of the MID1 B-box1âs consensus sequence being substituted with a histidine residue in TRIM16. Other TRIMs (eg.TRIM29 (ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene) and TRIM25 (The estrogen-responsive gene/EFP) also share this particular substitution <xref rid="pone.0037470-Massiah1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. An unbiased blast search of the NCBI database with TRIM16âs B-box1 sequence yields significant sequence identity with human TRIM16, TRIM29, TRIM25, MID1, RFP and MID2 (only TRIMs resulted, in order of significance all with E-values &lt;0.009, and scores above 37.7). Analysis of TRIM16âs B-box2 sequences yielded similar results to B-Box1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), although with a lower human sequence identity (28%) to MID1 (Sim, ExPASy, CA). When comparing the full-length of the sequence, TRIM16 shares low sequence identity with other TRIMs such as TRIM29, TRIM25, RFP, MID1 and MID2, except in the B-box1 region where the high homology amongst these TRIMs suggests a subgroup of TRIMs having a specific zinc-binding role in homeostasis.</p>

        <p>Protein ubiquitination occurs in a series of reactions in which a molecule of ubiquitin is transferred from the activating enzyme (E1), to a conjugating enzyme (E2), and, with the involvement of an E3 ligase, to a substrate or to the E3 ligase itself. Common features of E3 ligases are their ability to auto-ubiquitinate and self-degrade. TRIM16 is itself an unstable protein, degraded by proteasome mediated degradation. In various cell lines, TRIM16 protein quantity was increased after the proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, TRIM16 has a short protein half-life around 4 hours measured by cycloheximide-based protein chase experiments in both SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
        <p>This result, together with the fact that TRIM16âs B boxes can adopt a RING-like structure moved us to investigate whether TRIM16 exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity catalyzing auto-ubiquitination. TRIM16 E3 ligase activity was first examined by <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assay. TRIM16-GFP and TRIM16 domain deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and HA-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) were expressed in HEK293 cells; The cells were treated with MG132 four hours prior harvesting to preserve the polyubiquitin chains. GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and the presence of polyubiquitinated TRIM16 was detected by Western blot. Only full-length TRIM16 has a high-molecular-weight smear, representing polyubiquitinated TRIM16 as detected by anti-GFP and anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
        <p>TRIM16 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was further examined by <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction. TRIM16-myc-His was incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> together with recombinant human E1, a panel of E2 enzymes, HA-tagged Ub and ATP. TRIM16 showed auto-polyubiquitination activity with a specific family of E2 enzymes, UbcH5 (UbcH5a, UbcH5b, UbcH5c) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Other E2 enzymes tested produced no auto-polyubiquitination. To test whether B-Boxes of TRIM16 are required for auto-polyubiquitination, myc-His tagged TRIM16Â andÂ TRIM16 domain deletion mutants were incubatedÂ as above with E1, UbcH5b or catalytically inactive UbcH5b (C85A) enzymes. Extensive high molecular weight smears representing polyubiquitinated TRIM16, as detected by Western blot with anti-myc antibodies, is observed in the presence of catalytically active UbcH5b and wild-type TRIM16. In reaction where wild-type UbcH5b was substituted with a catalytically inactive variant UbcH5b (C85A), this auto-polyubiquitination was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). To investigate whether recombinant TRIM16 synthesized using cell free system is able to auto-ubiquitinate <italic>in vitro</italic>, we have performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay. Recombinant TRIM16 purified from wheat germ extract was incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> together with recombinant human E1, UbcH5b, HA-tagged Ub and ATP; reaction was supplemented with zinc chloride (Zn) as described in Takahashi H <italic>et al</italic>, 2009 <xref rid="pone.0037470-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. High-molecular-weight TRIM16 was detected when Zn and ATP were present in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037470-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, lane 1).</p>
        <p>The RING domain is typically known for its E3 ubiquitin ligase potential. Here we have demonstrated for the first time that a protein devoid of a classical RING domain can bind ubiquitin and auto-ubiquitinate via its B-boxes and function as an E3 ligase. In this report, we provide a first clue as to the function of the TRIM16 protein which is devoid of a classic RING domain. A surprising result of our study is that the B-boxes of TRIM16 exhibit an E3 ligase activity. We have also found that TRIM16 can homo and hetero-dimerize, a common feature found in other TRIMs. Therefore, in addition to its role as an E3 ligase we cannot exclude the possibility that TRIM16 may also control the stability of other TRIM proteins or that TRIM16 may function in a multi-subunit complex with other TRIMs enhancing their E3 ligase activity.</p>
        <p>The proteasome degradation pathway remains one of the most powerful regulatory systems in cells of normal and malignant phenotypes. In recent years, an important function of TRIM proteins in mediating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates as well as to themselves (auto-ubiquitination) have been shown to be involved in a number of critical processes in cell signalling, survival pathways and differentiation. Therefore, the interactions of the TRIM proteins have far reaching implications in all aspects of cells. Due to the scope of TRIM16 protein binding and structure studies as outlined here, our work suggest that TRIM16 is a useful biological model for the study of TRIM protein and ubiquitin interactions in the absence of the RING domain. Although TRIM16 lacks a RING domain, it nonetheless possesses important ubiquitination and heterodimerization functions, the implication of these functions in normal and cancer cells will need to be further elucidated.</p>
