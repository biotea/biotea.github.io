        <p id="P2">Mutations in <italic>SHANK3</italic> and large duplications of the region spanning <italic>SHANK3</italic> both cause a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that proper <italic>SHANK3</italic> dosage is critical for normal brain function. <italic>SHANK3</italic> overexpression <italic>per se</italic> has not been established as a cause of human disorders, however, because 22q13 duplications involve several genes. Here we report that <italic>Shank3</italic> transgenic mice modeling a human <italic>SHANK3</italic> duplication exhibit manic-like behavior and seizures consistent with synaptic excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. We also identified two patients with hyperkinetic disorders carrying the smallest <italic>SHANK3</italic>-spanning duplications reported so far. These findings suggest <italic>SHANK3</italic> overexpression causes a hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorder. To probe the mechanism underlying the phenotype, we generated a Shank3 <italic>in vivo</italic> interactome and found that Shank3 directly interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to increase F-actin levels in <italic>Shank3</italic> transgenic mice. The mood-stabilizing drug valproate, but not lithium, rescues the manic-like behavior of <italic>Shank3</italic> transgenic mice raising the possibility that this hyperkinetic disorder has a unique pharmacogenetic profile.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P3">An increasing number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and bipolar disorder are being classified as "synaptopathies"<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, because the genes mutated in these disorders lead to abnormal synaptic development or function. For example, all members of the <italic>SHANK</italic> gene family (<italic>SHANK1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>), which encode for core scaffolding proteins organizing macromolecular complexes at the postsynaptic density (PSD)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, have been linked to human synaptopathies<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Point mutations in <italic>SHANK3</italic> (also called <italic>ProSAP2</italic>) are seen in non-syndromic autism, ID and schizophrenia<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and deletions of the region containing <italic>SHANK3</italic> cause Phelan-McDermid syndrome (22q13 deletion syndrome)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mice modeling <italic>SHANK3</italic> deletion mirror the human behavioral phenotypes and display synaptic abnormalities<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Interestingly, a few 22q13 duplications spanning <italic>SHANK3</italic> have been reported in patients diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, suggesting that increased expression of <italic>SHANK3</italic> could be also deleterious. Because duplication cases involve large genomic regions (&gt;0.8 Mb) with more than 20 genes, however, it is unclear if it is <italic>SHANK3</italic> overexpression that causes a neurological phenotype. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of <italic>Shank3</italic>-overexpressing mice and on the role of <italic>SHANK3</italic> duplication in hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. We identify a mechanism that contributes to the neuronal phenotype and report pharmacological therapies that might benefit individuals with <italic>SHANK3</italic> overexpression.</p>

      <title>Manic-like behavior in <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice</title>
      <p id="P5">We introduced an N-terminal EGFP-tag into mouse <italic>Shank3</italic> to generate <italic>EGFP-Shank3</italic> transgenic (TG) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar to endogenous <italic>Shank3</italic><sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, <italic>EGFP-Shank3</italic> transcript was detected in cortex, hippocampus and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The regional and developmental expression of EGFP-Shank3 recapitulated those of endogenous Shank3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 1bâd</xref>). EGFP-Shank3 was targeted to the dendritic spines and co-localized with excitatory postsynaptic marker PSD-95, but not with inhibitory postsynaptic marker Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, TG mice expressed 1.2 to 2-fold higher levels of each of the three major Shank3 isoforms (Î±, Î² and Î³), with ~50% more total Shank3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 1e, f</xref>), which parallels expression in human <italic>SHANK3</italic> duplication patients. There was no significant change in levels of other synaptic proteins in the hippocampus and striatum of TG mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 1g, h</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P6">Our <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice showed increased locomotor activity and speed compared with WT littermates in the open field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). TG mice were also hyperactive in their home cages, suggesting that their behavior in the open field was not due to the novel environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Given that one patient carrying a large 22q13 duplication spanning <italic>SHANK3</italic> has been reported to have ADHD<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we sought to determine whether the hyperactivity in the TG mice is related to ADHD by testing whether it could be corrected by amphetamine, a treatment for ADHD. Surprisingly, rather than the expected paradoxical calming effect, an acute injection of amphetamine aggravated the hyperactivity of TG mice to a greater degree than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). As increased sensitivity to amphetamine is one characteristic of mania<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>âbipolar disorder can be misdiagnosed as ADHD, especially in children due to the overlap in diagnostic criteria<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>âwe pursued behavioral tests to determine if there are abnormalities typically associated with a manic state.</p>
      <p id="P7">Immobility during the tail-suspension test has been used as an indicator of despair. Consistent with manic-like behavior<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, the duration of immobility in <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice was less than WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>); the TG mice also exhibited elevated acoustic startle response with reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI), abnormal circadian rhythms, and hyperphagia-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2fâj</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d</xref>), all of which are behaviors observed in humans during manic episodes<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P8">We normalized Shank3 levels by crossing the TG mice with <italic>Shank3B</italic><sup>+/â</sup> mice<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and found that this reversed hyperactivity, reduced immobility in tail-suspension, and reduced PPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice also displayed decreased social interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 2eâg</xref>), which has also been seen in patients with large 22q13 duplications<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Unlike <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice did not exhibit repetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 2hâj</xref>), but they made fewer calls during the ultrasonic vocalization test at postnatal day 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 2k, l</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ~50% increase in Shank3 level causes a hyperkinetic phenotype in mice that resembles mania, and that it is the increased dosage of <italic>SHANK3</italic> in 22q13 duplications that likely contributes to hyperkinesia in humans.</p>

      <title><italic>SHANK3</italic> duplications in humans</title>
      <p id="P9">To confirm unequivocally the role of <italic>SHANK3</italic> dosage in the neuropsychiatric phenotypes, we queried the array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) database at the Molecular Genetics Laboratory of Baylor College of Medicine and identified two cases that carry small duplications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P10">The first individual is an 11-year old girl diagnosed with ADHD, combined type. The 22q13 duplication includes the entire <italic>SHANK3</italic> and part of the <italic>ACR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). <italic>ACR</italic> encodes acrosin, a protease expressed in sperm facilitating its penetration into oocytes, with no known expression or function in brain.

      <title>Synaptic E/I imbalance in <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice</title>
      <p id="P12">Having found that humans with <italic>SHANK3</italic> duplications have a hyperkinetic disorder and seizures, we evaluated the <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice for seizures and synaptic abnormalities. We observed spontaneous seizures in the <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice, but never in WT littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). We monitored for electrographic seizures using electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG of TG mice showed hyperexcitability discharges accompanied by electrographic seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Since alteration in the neuronal excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is considered to cause seizures<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, we examined morphological and functional changes of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons from TG mice displayed increased VGLUT1-positive PSD-95, an excitatory synaptic marker, and decreased VGAT-positive Gephyrin, an inhibitory synaptic marker, puncta density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P13">We examined functional properties of synapses by whole-cell patch clamping in CA1 pyramidal neurons of acute hippocampal slices. Neuronal density, paired-pulse facilitation ratio, input-output relationship, and intrinsic excitability of these neurons were similar in WT and TG mice, suggesting normal basal synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of TG mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 4aâe</xref>). Consistent with decreased density of VGAT-positive Gephyrin puncta in cultured hippocampal neurons from TG mice, we observed reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency, but not in amplitude or decay time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). AMPA receptor-mediated miniature EPSC (mEPSC) was normal, but amplitude of spontaneous EPSC (sEPSC, without TTX) was increased in TG mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). There was no change in AMPA/NMDA ratio in CA1 pyramidal neurons of TG mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Consistently, NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity measured by extracellular field recordings at Schaffer collateralâCA1 pyramidal synapses was normal in TG mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 4g, h</xref>). The spontaneous seizures of TG mice, together with morphological and functional alterations in synapses, suggest the synaptic E/I balance in TG neurons is shifted toward excitation.</p>

      <title>Arp2/3 complex mediates F-actin increase</title>
      <p id="P14">To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the synaptic alterations of <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice, we set out to identify the <italic>in vivo</italic> interactors of Shank3. We used the EGFP-tag of the <italic>Shank3</italic> transgene to isolate Shank3 protein complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass-spectrometry analysis identified 273 proteins that bind Shank3 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). There was significant overlap between the proteins on this list, those from our previous Y2H screening<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, and known mouse or human PSD proteins<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). We combined our two Shank3-focused experimental lists (previous Y2H screening<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and current <italic>in vivo</italic> IP, for a total 404 proteins called Shank3 interactome) for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 5c, d</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P15">We performed Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis, which suggested that regulation of actin cytoskeleton is a principal role of the Shank3 interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Based on this analysis, we hypothesized that abnormal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton could be one major molecular change in the synapses of TG mice. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of a 50% increase in Shank3 on F-actin levels. We found that F-actin levels of excitatory synapses were increased by ~30% in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons from TG mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), which was restored by expression of <italic>Shank3</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Next, we utilized our Shank3 interactome to generate a sub-network of actin-related proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) to focus the search on molecular mediators of the elevated F-actin. This network comprises both known and novel Shank3 interactors, which we confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 5f</xref>). The most interesting new Shank3 direct interactors we identified (based on both Y2H screening and <italic>in vivo</italic> IP) were two subunits of the Arp2/3 complex (ARPC2 and ARPC5L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Arp2/3 complex consists of seven-subunits and binds directly to the F-actin mother filament to initiate nucleation and branching<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Consistent with the interaction analysis, ARPC2 clusters co-localized with EGFP-Shank3 and significantly enlarged in TG neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>); the latter observation was reversed by <italic>Shank3</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). To initiate actin polymerization, Arp2/3 complex must be activated by nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs)<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Given that the NPFs WASF1 and Cortactin (CTTN) directly interact with Shank3<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, Shank3 could function as a scaffold that brings WASF1, Cortactin and Arp2/3 together, facilitating the formation of F-actin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, co-localization of WASF1 and ARPC2 was enhanced in TG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Furthermore, the density of dendritic spines was increased in TG brains compared to WT brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P16">Our analysis suggested hippocampal pyramidal neurons of TG mice have a reduced number of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, c</xref>), which was unexpected based on the exclusive localization of EGFP-Shank3 in excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To understand the underlying mechanism, we first investigated inhibitory neurons, changes of which might secondarily affect inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neurons. However, we found that there was no difference in synapse number on the GAD-6-positive inhibitory neurons of TG mice, although these neurons express EGFP-Shank3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">We next explored a possible cell-autonomous relationship between excitatory and inhibitory synapses of TG pyramidal neurons. We hypothesized that increased clustering of actin-related proteins in excitatory synapses might reduce some of those proteins in inhibitory synapses, thereby contributing to the decrease of inhibitory synapse number. We focused on actin-related proteins, since the actin cytoskeleton defines the molecular architecture of both E/I synapses<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. We picked Mena and Profilin as candidates for four reasons: they directly interact with Gephyrin in inhibitory synapses<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>; Profilin1 and Profilin2 are recruited to excitatory synapses by neuronal activity<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>; Profilin2 was also identified in our Shank3 <italic>in vivo</italic> IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>); and Mena and Profilin interact with proteins in the Shank3 interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Both proteins showed decreased localization to inhibitory synapses, and Profilin2 showed enhanced localization to excitatory synapses in TG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5gâi</xref>). Together, these results suggest that increased expression of Shank3 enhances F-actin levels through Arp2/3 complex in excitatory synapses of TG neurons. By modulating the synaptic distributions of Mena and Profilin2, this contributes, at least in part, to changes in inhibitory synapses.</p>

      <title><italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice respond to valproate</title>
      <p id="P18">Having established that Shank3 overexpression causes mania-like behavior in mice and a hyperkinetic syndrome in humans, we tested whether mood-stabilizing drugs for human mania could rescue the behavioral abnormalities of TG mice. First, we examined the effect of lithium, the first FDA-approved treatment for bipolar disorder, which inhibits multiple targets including inositol monophosphatase and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. The basal activity of GSK-3Î² in TG mouse hippocampus and striatum was similar to that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Mice were fed with lithium carbonate-containing chow for three weeks, resulting in serum lithium levels (WT: 0.82 Â± 0.04, TG: 0.91 Â± 0.08 mmol/L) comparable to those in the therapeutic range for humans (0.6~1.2 mmol/L). Lithium did not mitigate any of the manic-like behaviors of <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P19">Given that our mice display seizures in addition to manic-like behavior, we decided to test valproate, another FDA-approved mood-stabilizing drug used to treat manic or mixed episodes that also acts as an anticonvulsant, increases GABA neurotransmission and inhibits sodium channels, calcium channels and histone deacetylase 1<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We treated the TG mice with acute intraperitoneal injections of either valproate (200 mg/kg) or saline and subjected them to behavioral testing. Valproate reversed the baseline hyperactivity, the amphetamine-hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>), and the abnormal acoustic startle response and PPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6eâh</xref>) in TG mice. The behavior of WT mice, except for a decrease in baseline activity and an increase of PPI in male mice, was not significantly affected by valproate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6câh</xref>). Valproate also significantly decreased the frequency of epileptiform spikes in TG mice as measured by EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P20">There are multiple genomic loci for which both deletions and duplications cause human neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that proper dosage of some genes is critical for normal brain function<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In most cases, however, the genes causing the respective phenotypes are poorly defined, making it hard to understand pathogenesis and to develop targeted therapies. Chromosome 22q13 spanning <italic>SHANK3</italic> is one example. Although <italic>SHANK3</italic> loss has been shown to cause ASD in humans, <italic>SHANK3</italic> overexpression has never been definitively determined to cause neuropsychiatric disease. In this study, we generated <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice that model a human duplication and identified patients with the smallest 22q13 duplications involving <italic>SHANK3</italic>. The remarkable similarity of the neurobehavioral phenotypes between the mouse model and patients with <italic>SHANK3</italic> duplications supports the notion that <italic>SHANK3</italic> overexpression causes a hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorder that approximates mania. Indeed, either a 50% reduction or 50% increase in Shank3 levels results in marked neuropsychiatric phenotypes and a predisposition to epilepsy.</p>
      <p id="P21">Notably, the manic-like behavior of <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice was reversed selectively by valproate but not by lithium treatment. It is not uncommon to find human patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) that are resistant to lithium monotherapy<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Indeed, a subset of individuals with the rapid-cycling form of BPD is highly resistant to lithium<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. As GSK-3 is considered the major target for lithiumâs efficacy in the treatment of BPD<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, the lithium-resistance of <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice and their normal GSK-3Î² activity are congruent with a mechanism independent of GSK-3 and possibly more dependent upon synaptic alterations, including E/I imbalance.</p>
      <p id="P22">Synaptic E/I imbalance is likely to underlie the pathogenesis for seizures<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. We found morphological and functional changes in E/I synapses of TG neurons favoring excitation, which might account for both seizures and hyperkinetic behavior. Consistent with this, GABAergic dysfunction in patients with bipolar disorder has been reported<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and valproate (which increases GABA neurotransmission and decreases high-frequency action potential firing) rescued the manic-like behaviors of TG mice. In contrast, lithium enhances excitatory postsynaptic potentials in CA1 synapses<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, which might explain the resistance of <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice to lithium treatment. Mechanistically, enhanced F-actin polymerization through Arp2/3 complex could be responsible for the synaptic changes of TG neurons, but other Shank3-dependent molecular pathways cannot be excluded.</p>
      <p id="P23">In conclusion, our study advances our understanding of the human diseases associated with <italic>SHANK3</italic> and the mechanisms that can lead to bipolar disorder. We propose two distinct mechanisms leading to bipolar disorder: one is dysfunction of the well-established GSK-3 pathway that is responsive to lithium treatment; the second is a synaptic dysfunction associated with an E/I balance shifted toward excitation, which could result in hyperkinetic behaviors, and which is resistant to lithium but sensitive to valproate. We believe this sort of pharmacogenetic analysis in model organisms could improve treatment strategies for patients with bipolar disorder as the genetic underpinnings of each patient's illness are elucidated.</p>

The age- and gender-matched C57BL/6J mice were used as novel partners. Two days before the test, the novel partner mice were habituated to the wire cages (3 in diameter Ã 4 in height) for 1 hour per day. The wire cage with inanimate novel object inside served as a control. The test mouse was habituated in the chamber for 15 min as described<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. During the habituation period, neither wild-type nor <italic>Shank3</italic> transgenic mice showed a preference for either side of the chamber (data not shown). After the habituation period, the novel partner mouse was placed into one of the wire cages and located randomly in either the right or left side of chamber. The novel object was placed into the wire cage located in the other side of chamber. The test mouse was allowed to explore the three chamber apparatus for 15 min. The movements were recorded and the total amount of time spent in each chamber was automatically measured by ANY-maze software (Stoelting Co.). The close interaction time, defined by rearing, sniffing or pawing at each wire cage, was measured manually.</p>

The third EEG electrode made of silver wire (127 Âµm diameter) was implanted in the subdural space of the right frontal cortex area. A reference/grounding electrode was then positioned in the occipital region of the skull. All electrode wires were attached to a miniature connector (Harwin Connector). After 3â5 days of post-surgical recovery, EEG activities (filtered between 0.1 Hz and 5 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz) were recorded for 1 hour per day over 3â5 days. In the experiments evaluating the effects of valproate on EEG activities, adult male <italic>Shank3</italic> TG mice with implanted electrode went through recording sessions for 3 consecutive days.

Acute fresh hippocampal slices were prepared from FVB/N male mice at the age of 6â8 weeks old as previously described<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Coronal slices (250 Âµm thick) containing medial hippocampus were cut with a vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc) in a chamber filled with chilled (2â5 Â°C) cutting solution containing (in mM) 110 choline-chloride, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 3.1 sodium pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The slices were then incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM) containing 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 D-glucose, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> at the room temperature. The solutions were bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Whole-cell recording was made using patchclamp amplifiers (Multiclamp 700B) under infraredâdifferential interference contrast microscopy (Zeiss). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using digitizers (DigiData 1440A) and analysis software pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs), miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) and IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons at â70 mV in voltage-clamp mode. sEPSCs were recorded in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker, SR95531 (10 ÂµM). mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.5 ÂµM) and SR95531 (10 ÂµM). Glass pipettes with a resistance of 2.5-5 MÎ© were filled with a solution containing (in mM) 140 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, pH 7.2 (with KOH). For recording mIPSCs, potassium gluconate was replaced with KCl (140 ÂµM) in the pipette solution. Besides TTX (0.5 ÂµM), glutamate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium (CNQX) (10 ÂµM) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-AP-5) (25 ÂµM) were also added to the bath. Series resistance (15â30 MÎ©) and input resistance (100â200 MÎ©) were monitored throughout the whole-cell recording. Evoked EPSCs were recorded in the presence of SR95531 (10 ÂµM). To stimulate presynaptic inputs, stimulation pulses (50 Âµs duration at 0.1 Hz) were applied to a bipolar tungsten stimulation electrode (WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL) placed along the Schaffer collaterals. Extracellular stimuli were administered using a stimulator system (Master 8, Jerusalem, Israel). The stimulating and recording pipettes were placed at the same depth in the slice and the distance between them was kept constant (~300 Âµm). Data were discarded when the change in the series resistance was &gt;20% during the course of the experiment. The whole-cell recording was performed at (30 Â± 1) Â°C with the help of an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instr.). For measurements of the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor ratio, the CA1 pyramidal neuron was voltage-clamped at 40mV. First, a stable baseline recording of total EPSCs was obtained. The NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP-5 (50 mM) was then applied to the bath for 5â10 min to isolate fast AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs. Digital subtraction of AMPA-receptor-EPSCs from the total EPSCs from the same neuron yielded NMDA-receptor-EPSCs. An average of 12â20 EPSCs were collected for each type of EPSC. The bath solution contained picrotoxin (100 ÂµM). The intracellular solution contained 140mM CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 10mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 5mM TEA-Cl, 2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5mM MgATP and 0.3mM GTP, pH7.2â7.4 (with CsOH).</p>

Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were recorded at 31 Â± 0.5 Â°C in an interface chamber perfused at 1 ml/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 15 D-glucose. Extracellular stimuli were administered along the Schaffer collaterals using Formvar-insulated, bipolar nichrome electrodes controlled by a stimulus isolator (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA). An ACSF-filled glass-recording electrode was placed in <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> to record the field potential changes. Electrophysiological traces were amplified with AC-coupled amplifier (model 1800; A-M Systems), digitized using a Digidata 1320A (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), and acquired with pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). To assess baseline synaptic transmission, input-output relationships were examined by measuring the rising slope of the fEPSP evoked by 100 Âµs pulses over various stimulus intensities (1V to 10V). The stimulation intensity that evoked a fEPSP whose slope was 30â40% of the maximum fEPSP slope, determined by the input-output recording experiment, was used for the following recording paradigms. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by two trains of 100 stimuli pulses at 100 Hz that are separated 20 sec apart. To monitor LTP development, the fEPSPs were recorded every 20 seconds for 20 minutes before and 60 minutes after induction. The magnitude of potentiation was determined by measuring the changes in the slope of the fEPSP. NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) formation was induced with 900 paired stimuli with 50 msec inter-stimulus interval at 1 Hz frequency. In all experiments, genotypes will be confirmed by PCR with tails cut. All data are shown as mean Â± s.e.m.</p>

The eluted proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant blue-stain and excised into 10 gel pieces according to molecular size. The individual gel pieces were destained and subject to in-gel digestion using trypsin. Tryptic peptide was dissolved in 10 Âµl of loading solution (5% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid) and subjected to nanoflow LC-MS/MS analysis with a nano-LC II (Thermo Scientific) coupled to LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. The peptides were loaded onto an in-housed Reprosil-Pur Basic C18 (3 Âµm, Dr.Maisch GmbH, Germany) trap column which was 2 cm Ã 75 um size. Then the trap column was washed with loading solution and switched in-line with an in-housed 100 mm Ã 75 um column packed with Reprosil-Pur Basic C18 equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water. The peptides were separated with a 75 min discontinuous gradient of 5â28% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 450 nl/min. Separated peptides were directly electro-sprayed into LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. The LTQ Orbitrap instrument was operated in the data-dependant mode acquiring fragmentation spectra of the top 50 strongest ions and under direct control of Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific). Obtained MS/MS spectra were searched against target-decoy mouse refseq database in Proteome Discoverer 1.3 interface (Thermo Fisher) with Mascot algorithm (Mascot 2.3, Matrix Science). The precursor mass tolerance was confined within 20 ppm with fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 dalton and a maximum of two missed cleavage allowed. Assigned peptides were filtered with 5% false discover rate (FDR) and subject to manual verifications. Any protein whose peptide was identified from wild-type brain sample was excluded from the further analysis.</p>
