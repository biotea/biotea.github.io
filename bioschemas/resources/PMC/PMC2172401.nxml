        <p>Plexins are widely expressed transmembrane proteins that mediate the effects of semaphorins. The molecular mechanisms of plexin-mediated signal transduction are still rather unclear. Plexin-B1 has recently been shown to mediate activation of RhoA through a stable interaction with the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG. However, it is unclear how the activity of plexin-B1 and its downstream effectors is regulated by its ligand Sema4D. Here, we show that plexin-B family members stably associate with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2. Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB-2, resulting in the phosphorylation of both plexin-B1 and ErbB-2. A dominant-negative form of ErbB-2 blocks Sema4D-induced RhoA activation as well as axonal growth cone collapse in primary hippocampal neurons. Our data indicate that ErbB-2 is an important component of the plexin-B receptor system and that ErbB-2âmediated phosphorylation of plexin-B1 is critically involved in Sema4D-induced RhoA activation, which underlies cellular phenomena downstream of plexin-B1, including axonal growth cone collapse.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Semaphorins are a group of secreted or membrane bound proteins, which have been shown to regulate axonal pathfinding during the development of the nervous system (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Raper, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fiore and PÃ¼schel, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pasterkamp and Kolodkin, 2003</xref>). Their effects are mediated by plexins, a group of transmembrane proteins. Although originally described in the nervous system, most members of the semaphorinâplexin signaling system are also expressed outside the nervous system (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Furuyama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kameyama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Maestrini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa et al., 1997</xref>) and are involved in the regulation of immune functions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bismuth and Boumsell, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kikutani and Kumanogoh, 2003</xref>), in invasive tumor growth (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>), or in morphogenetic processes during vascular, lung, epidermal, or cardiac development (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Goshima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Klagsbrun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Serini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Toyofuku et al., 2004</xref>). Four different families of plexins have been identified in the mammalian system: plexin-A1â4, plexin-B1â3, plexin-C1, and plexin-D1 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tamagnone and Comoglio, 2000</xref>). In addition to plexins, various other proteins have been implicated either as receptors for semaphorins or as components of the semaphorin receptor complex (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pasterkamp and Kolodkin, 2003</xref>). The vertebrate class 3 semaphorins, which signal via plexin-A family members, require the assistance from neuropilins serving as high affinity binding sites for the semaphorin (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rohm et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Antipenko et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, other semaphorins like semaphorin 4D (Sema4D, also known as cluster of differentiation antigen 100) or Sema7A bind with high affinity directly to plexin-B1 and plexin-C1, respectively (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>), and do not activate neuropilins. There is evidence that semaphorins can also act through plexin-independent mechanisms. Sema4D can regulate lymphocyte function by binding to cluster of differentiation antigen 72 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kumanogoh et al., 2000</xref>), which may also mediate some effects of Sema4D in the nervous system (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Moreau-Fauvarque et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, Sema4A enhances T cell activation by interacting with Tim-2 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kumanogoh et al., 2002</xref>), and recent evidence indicates that Sema7A can interact with Î²1-type integrins (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Considerable progress has recently been made in understanding the signaling mechanisms used by plexin-B1. Several small GTPases of the Rho family have been involved in plexin-B1âmediated signaling. Plexin-B1 can directly interact with the GTP-bound form of Rac (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rohm et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Driessens et al., 2001</xref>). This interaction inhibits Rac-dependent processes by sequestering the active form of Rac (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, plexin-B1 forms a complex with PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)âRhoGEF/leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) through its carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aurandt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Driessens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hirotani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Perrot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 and activation of chimeric plexin-B2 stimulates PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG activity, resulting in activation of RhoA (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aurandt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Perrot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). Dominant-negative forms of PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG block Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>) as well as neurite retraction in PC12 cells (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Perrot et al., 2002</xref>), thereby demonstrating the role of RhoGEF-mediated RhoA activation in Sema4D-induced cytoskeletal changes. It has been suggested that Rnd1, which binds to the cytoplasmic part of plexin-B1, can promote the interaction between plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Oinuma et al., 2003</xref>). However, it remains unclear how the activity of plexin-B1 and its downstream effectors is regulated by Sema4D. It was recently shown that in epithelial cells, plexin-B1 associates with the scatter factor 1/hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met. Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 can control the invasive growth of these cells by stimulating the tyrosine kinase activity of Met, which results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both plexin-B1 and Met (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we show that plexin-B family members can also interact with the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ErbB-2. Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 induces ErbB-2 activation, which results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both plexin-B1 and ErbB-2. ErbB-2âmediated phosphorylation of plexin-B1 is required for Sema4D-induced RhoA activation as well as for plexin-B1âmediated axonal growth cone collapse. This finding suggests that ErbB-2 is part of a signaling complex that is required for plexin-Bâmediated regulation of cellular functions by semaphorins.</p>

        <title>Tyrphostin AG 1478 inhibits plexin-B1 tyrosine phosphorylation and RhoA activation in response to Sema4D</title>
        <p>Recent evidence shows that plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG form a stable complex that mediates Sema4D-induced RhoA activation. However, the mechanism of plexin-B1âmediated activation of RhoGEF proteins remains unclear. We postulated that additional signals are involved in plexin-B1 activation and subsequent stimulation of RhoGEF activity by Sema4D. Therefore, we tested a variety of pharmacological inhibitors of common effectors like phosphoinositide kinases, phospholipases, and protein kinases for their potential ability to block plexin-B1/PDZ-RhoGEFâdependent RhoA activation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF. Inhibition of phosphoinositide-3 kinase, phospholipase C, or various protein kinases like Erk, Mek, p38, Src, and protein kinase C had no effect on RhoA activation. However, the tyrphostin AG1478, which inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family in intact cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Egeblad et al., 2001</xref>), almost completely blocked Sema4D-mediated activation of RhoA at a concentration of 1 Î¼M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors like the PDGF receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1296 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Levitzki and Gazit, 1995</xref>) or K252a, which has been shown to inhibit autophosphorylation of various receptor tyrosine kinases like TrkA or Met at nanomolar concentrations (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Morotti et al., 2002</xref>), were without effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). AG1478 had no effect on the activation of RhoA through active forms of GÎ±<sub>12</sub>/GÎ±<sub>13</sub> and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), suggesting that AG1478 does not interfere nonspecifically with RhoGEF-mediated activation of RhoA and that an AG1478-sensitive tyrosine kinase is involved in some of the signaling mechanisms upstream of RhoA activation brought about by the plexin-B1/RhoGEF complex.</p>

        <p>To substantiate the potential involvement of a tyrosine kinase activity in Sema4D-induced RhoA activation, we tested whether plexin-B1 or its downstream effectors PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to Sema4D. Cells cotransfected with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV)-tagged plexin-B1 and FLAG-tagged versions of PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG were treated with supernatants of cells expressing the myc-tagged extracellular portion of Sema4D, and plexin-B1 or RhoGEF proteins were subsequently immunoprecipitated. We could not detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of precipitated RhoGEF proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). However, plexin-B1 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in a Sema4D-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). As expected, only plexin-B1 but not other plexins like plexin-B2, -B3, or -D1, which do not serve as Sema4D receptors, was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Sema4D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 in response to Sema4D was completely inhibited by 1 Î¼M of AG1478 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C).</p>

        <title>ErbB-2 is involved in Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 phosphorylation and RhoA activation</title>
        <p>Based on the inhibitory effect of the ErbB receptor kinase blocker AG1478, we tested the effect of dominant-negative mutants of ErbB-1â4 lacking the cytoplasmic portion of the protein (ÎC-terminal mutant) on Sema4D-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 as well as on Sema4D-induced RhoA activation in heterologously transfected HEK293 cells. HEK cells express ErbB-1, ErbB-2, and Met, whereas ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 could not be detected (see online supplemental materials, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312094/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312094/DC1</ext-link>). Although expression of ÎC-terminal mutants of ErbB-1, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 had no effect, the expression of a COOH-terminally truncated version of ErbB-2 as well as an ErbB-2 mutant lacking the kinase domain completely blocked both Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as Sema4D-induced RhoA activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). In contrast, a dominant-negative ÎC-terminal mutant of Met reduced Sema4D-induced RhoA activation and plexin-B1 phosphorylation by only a minor extent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C).</p>

Cells were treated with medium from Mock (â)- or Sema4D (+)-transfected cells, lysed, and plexin-B1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) using VSV antibody.

However, ErbB-2 is the preferred dimerization partner for the other ErbB family members, ErbB-1, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Karunagaran et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Graus-Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Holbro and Hynes, 2004</xref>), which serve as receptors for various ligands including EGF, TGFÎ±, and neuregulins (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2003</xref>). To exclude any potential unspecific effects of supernatants derived from HEK293 cells expressing Sema4D, we tested the effect of purified histidine (His)-tagged Sema4D on plexin-B1 phosphorylation. Purified Sema4D induced tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation could be observed at 1 min after addition of Sema4D and reached a peak after â¼10 min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Cells lacking plexin-B1 expression did not respond to Sema4D (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, direct binding of Sema4D to cells expressing ErbB-2 was not observed (unpublished data). Thus, the involvement of ErbB-2 in plexin-B1âmediated signaling appears to occur subsequent to the binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1.</p>

        <title>Sema4D activates downstream signaling of ErbB-2</title>
        <p>Ligand-induced activation of heterodimerized ErbB-2 results in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on ErbB-2 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hazan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Segatto et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Olayioye et al., 2000</xref>). To test if ErbB-2 is phosphorylated in response to Sema4D, we exposed HEK293 cells expressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF to increasing concentrations of purified Sema4D. Cell lysates were probed with site-specific antiphosphotyrosine antibodies directed against tyrosine phosphorylation sites on ErbB-2. Sema4D induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 1139 and 1248 but not of tyrosine residues 877 (not depicted) or 1112 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). In contrast, EGF, which can signal through an ErbB-1/ErbB-2 heterodimer, induced phosphorylation of tyrosines 1112, 1139, and 1248 of ErbB-2 in the same cells. Interestingly, the relative potencies of Sema4D and EGF with regard to the induction of site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation clearly differed. Although Sema4D induced phosphorylation of Y1248 at much lower concentrations than of Y1139, there were no major differences in the concentrations of EGF required for phosphorylation of Y1112, Y1139, or Y1248 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues 1139 and 1248 of ErbB-2 have been shown to serve as binding sites for Grb2 and Shc (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al., 1995</xref>). Shc becomes phosphorylated after binding to phosphorylated ErbB-2 and mediates ErbB-2âdependent Erk activation together with Grb2 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ravichandran, 2001</xref>). Indeed, Shc was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated after addition of Sema4D (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C), and Sema4D induced activation of Erk, although with lower potency than it induced Shc phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>Expression of an ErbB-2 mutant in which tyrosine 1248 was mutated to phenylalanine (ErbB-2(Y1248P)) completely blocked Sema4D-induced phosphorylation of endogenous ErbB-2 as well as of transfected ErbB-2 at tyrosine 1248 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Consequently, ErbB-2(Y1248P) blocked Sema4D-induced phosphorylation of Shc and also greatly reduced Erk activation by Sema4D (unpublished data). However, the ErbB-2(Y1248P) mutant had no effect on the activation of RhoA produced by Sema4D (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Furthermore, although the MEK1/2 inhibitor P98059 blocked Sema4D-induced Erk activation (unpublished data), it failed to affect plexin-B1âmediated activation of RhoA.</p>

        <p>Both the active GTP-bound form of Rac as well as the small GTPase Rnd1 have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic portion of plexin-B1 and to modulate plexin-B1 signaling (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Oinuma et al., 2003</xref>). As described previously, active Rac increased the surface expression of plexin-B1 in cells transfected with plexin-B1 alone (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2002</xref>). However, Rac1 had no effect on surface expression of plexin-B1 in cells coexpressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). In contrast, Rnd1 increased surface expression of plexin-B1 only in cells coexpressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that Rnd1 promotes the interaction between plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Oinuma et al., 2003</xref>). We asked whether Rac1 or Rnd1 would modulate Sema4D-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1. Interestingly, both constitutively active Rac as well as Rnd1 enhanced Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 phosphorylation in cells coexpressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). The observed increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 in the presence of active Rac1 occurred in the absence of any effect of Rac on the surface expression of plexin-B1. In contrast, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 in the presence of Rnd1 concurred with and may result from an increased membrane localization of plexin-B1 in cells expressing Rnd1.</p>

        <title>ErbB-2 and Met are involved in Sema4D-induced axonal growth cone collapse</title>
        <p>To test whether or not ErbB-2 is involved in the biological effects of Sema4D, we studied its role in plexin-B1âmediated axonal growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). ErbB-2, which is widely expressed in the central nervous system (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gerecke et al., 2001</xref>), was found to be expressed in axonal growth cones of primary hippocampal neurons cultured from E17 rat embryos (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). Based on the finding that Sema4D induced an autophosphorylation of ErbB-2 in HEK293 cells, we tested if ErbB-2 underwent autophosphorylation in response to Sema4D in axonal growth cones of hippocampal neurons. Staining of neurons with an antibody specific for phosphorylated tyrosine 1248 revealed that Sema4D-induced activation of ErbB-2 occurred mainly in the central domain of the growth cone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B). To test if Met is also expressed in axonal growth cones and becomes activated upon exposure to Sema4D, we stained hippocampal neurons with antibodies recognizing Met phosphorylated at tyrosine residues 1234 and 1235. Sema4D induced phosphorylation of Met in the entire growth cone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Plexins are transmembrane proteins mediating the effects of semaphorins, which were originally identified as prominent repulsive guidance factors for axonal growth cones during neural development. There is now increasing evidence that signaling via semaphorins and plexins is involved in the regulation of cellular functions in many other organ systems. Several recent studies have addressed the signaling mechanisms downstream of plexins. Plexin-B family members have recently been shown to form a stable complex through their COOH termini with the RhoGEF proteins PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG, which mediate plexin-B1âdependent activation of RhoA and subsequent changes of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the mechanisms underlying the activation of plexin-B1 remained unclear so far. Here, we show that the tyrosine kinase ErbB-2 is critically involved in Sema4D-induced activation of plexin-B1 and downstream signaling processes via the small GTPase RhoA. Plexin-B family members associate with endogenous ErbB-2, an interaction that requires the extracellular domains of both receptors. Activation of plexin-B1 by Sema4D results in tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 by ErbB-2. Inhibition of ErbB-2âmediated tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 blocks Sema4D-induced RhoA activation in HEK293 cells. Finally, dominant-negative forms of ErbB-2 block Sema4D-induced activation of RhoA in HEK293 cells as well as Sema4D-induced collapse of axonal growth cones in primary hippocampal neurons.</p>
      <p>Plexin-B1 has previously been shown to associate with an unidentified tyrosine kinase activity, which can phosphorylate plexin-B1 in vitro (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>). Genetic data indicate that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> protein off-track (OTK), which is structurally related to receptor kinases, can functionally interact with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> plexin-A. Biochemical analysis suggests that OTK coimmunoprecipitates with mammalian plexins including plexin-B1 (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Winberg et al., 2001</xref>). The functional significance of these findings is not clear because OTK and its mammalian orthologues are unlikely to be enzymatically active (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Mossie et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 1996</xref>). More recent studies have shown that the receptor tyrosine kinase Met associates with plexin-B1. Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of Met, resulting in the phosphorylation of both receptors and the Met substrate Gab1 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>). Although this paper implicates Met in Sema4D-induced effects on epithelial cell invasive growth, it remained unknown whether or not Met is required for the Sema4D-induced activation of Rho via the plexin-B1/RhoGEF complex.</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that after activation, plexin-B1 can also functionally interact with ErbB-2 and that ErbB-2âmediated phosphorylation of plexin-B1 is required for signaling of plexin-B1 via RhoGEF proteins. Sema4D-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 and subsequent RhoA activation were only slightly reduced in the presence of a dominant-negative form of Met. In addition, the Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a had no effect on plexin-B1 phosphorylation in response to Sema4D, indicating that Met is not necessarily required for plexin-B1 activation. In contrast, phosphorylation of plexin-B1 and Sema4D-induced RhoA activation were highly sensitive to the ErbB-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 and to dominant-negative ErbB-2, thereby suggesting that the tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB-2 is involved in ligand-dependent plexin-B1 phosphorylation. This finding is consistent with our finding that plexin-B family members and ErbB-2 can specifically associate.</p>
      <p>ErbB-2 is unique among the ErbB family members as it has no known ligand and can be activated only in trans by ErbB-1, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 or other tyrosine kinases like Jak2 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Olayioye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yamauchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>). Recent structural data show that the extracellular portion of ErbB-2 exists in an extended configuration that very likely interferes with ligand binding (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it appears unlikely that Sema4D can directly act on ErbB-2. Consistent with this, we did not observe any direct binding of Sema4D to ErbB-2, nor did we see an activation of ErbB-2 in the absence of plexin-B1. This observation indicates that Sema4D activates ErbB-2 indirectly through plexin-B1. However, the mechanisms through which Sema4D-bound plexin-B1 activates ErbB-2, and in turn becomes phosphorylated, is still not clear. An involvement of other ErbB family members appears unlikely because dominant-negative mutants of ErbB-1, ErbB-3, or ErbB-4 have no effect on Sema4D-induced activation of plexin-B1. Given that ErbB-2 and plexin-B1 associate even in the absence of ligands, it is conceivable that Sema4D-induced clustering of plexin-B1 results in the formation of plexin-B1/ErbB-2 heterooligomers, which then allow ErbB-2 to dimerize and to become activated.</p>
      <p>Sema4D-induced activation of ErbB-2 kinase activity also results in the autophosphorylation of ErbB-2. Interestingly, the pattern of ErbB-2 tyrosine residues phosphorylated in response to Sema4D was different from that induced by EGF. In contrast to EGF, Sema4D did not induce phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 1112, which has been shown to provide a docking side for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Klapper et al., 2000</xref>). Binding of c-Cbl to ErbB-2 enhances ubiquitination and degradation of ErbB-2 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Klapper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Levkowitz et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, lack of phosphorylation of ErbB-2 at tyrosine 1112 in response to Sema4D may reduce the propensity of ErbB-2 to become degradated after activation. In addition, Sema4D-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 1139 occurred with much lower potency than phosphorylation of tyrosine 1248, whereas EGF-induced phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues occurred with very similar potency. These differences between EGF and Sema4D with regard to the phosphorylation of ErbB-2 support the view that both stimuli use different mechanisms and probably also different kinases for ErbB-2 phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>Sema4D-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 1248 and tyrosine 1139, which recruit Shc and Grb2, resulted in the activation of the Erk pathway. However, inhibition of Sema4D-induced Shc phosphorylation and Erk activation using an ErbB-2 mutant lacking tyrosine 1248 or by inhibition of MEK1/2 did not affect Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 phosphorylation and subsequent RhoA activation. This result indicates that phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and activation of downstream signaling pathways is not required for plexin-B1âmediated activation of RhoA. Consistent with this finding, EGF-induced ErbB-2 phosphorylation and activation did not result in plexin-B1 phosphorylation and RhoA activation. However, we observed that EGF can inhibit Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition is most likely due to the ability of EGF to sequester ErbB-2, making it unavailable to support Sema4D-induced plexin-B1 activation. This finding indicates that plexin-B1 and the EGF receptor ErbB-1 interact with the same pool of ErbB-2 and that also other factors that use ErbB-2âmediated signaling pathways may interfere with plexin-B1 activation by Sema4D.</p>
      <p>The small GTPases Rac and Rnd1 have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic portion of plexin-B1 and to enhance plexin-B1âmediated signaling (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Oinuma et al., 2003</xref>). Constitutively active Rac is able to increase the surface localization of plexin-B1 in a heterologous expression system as well as to increase its affinity for Sema4D (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2002</xref>). However, active Rac had no effect on plexin-B1 surface expression in HEK293 cells coexpressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, Rnd1 increased surface expression of plexin-B1 in cells coexpressing plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF, which is consistent with the idea that Rnd1 promotes the interaction of plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Oinuma et al., 2003</xref>). We found that Rnd1 and active Rac also increase Sema4D-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1. Rac-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of plexin-B1 appeared to be stronger than the effect of Rac on surface expression of plexin-B1. This observation suggests that binding of active Rac promotes plexin-B1 activation by increasing the affinity for Sema4D (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Vikis et al., 2002</xref>) or by other mechanisms that facilitate ligand-induced phosphorylation of plexin-B1. Our data support the view that active Rac is able to modulate plexin-B1âmediated signaling.</p>
      <p>The observation that Sema4D is able to indirectly activate ErbB-2 and to induce Erk activation raises the interesting possibility that signaling pathways downstream of ErbB-2 mediate some of the biological effects exerted by Sema4D and other potential ligands for plexin-B family members. Besides its role in tumor progression (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Holbro et al., 2003</xref>), ErbB-2 has been shown to play an important role in various morphogenetic processes during development (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Citri et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, several human fetal tissues like brain, lung, liver, and kidney have been shown to express ErbB-2 as well as plexin-B1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Coussens et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Maestrini et al., 1996</xref>). Based on the ability of plexin-B1 to mediate ErbB-2 activation, it will be interesting to explore the potential role of a functional interaction between plexin-B1 and ErbB-2 in tumor progression as well as in various developmental processes.</p>
      <p>Recently, the receptor tyrosine kinase Met has been implicated in plexin-B1 signaling. Our data indicate that the relative contribution of Met to plexin-B1âmediated effects may be cell specific. For example, in HEK293 cells, Sema4D-induced plexin-B1/RhoGEF activation does not necessarily require Met, whereas ErbB-2 is strictly essential. However, in developing primary hippocampal neurons, Sema4D-induced axonal growth cone collapse could be blocked by dominant-negative mutants of both ErbB-2 and Met, and both tyrosine kinases became phosphorylated in axonal growth cones upon exposure of neurons to Sema4D. This finding suggests that both tyrosine kinases may be involved in morphogenetic effects induced by Sema4D in developing neurons, which is consistent with the finding that plexin-B1 associates with Met (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>) as well as with ErbB-2, as shown here, and can signal through both receptor tyrosine kinases. Although an interaction between ErbB-1 and Met has been reported (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al., 2000</xref>), a direct interaction between Met and ErbB-2 has not been described yet. Although we have been unable to coimmunoprecipitate both proteins in HEK293 cells, one cannot rule out the possibility that Met and ErbB-2 exist in a heterooligomeric complex with plexin-B1.</p>
      <p>In summary, we show that plexin-B family members associate with ErbB-2 and that Sema4D is able to activate ErbB-2 indirectly via plexin-B1. Sema4D may exert some of its activities by downstream signaling of ErbB-2. However, plexin-B1/RhoGEFâmediated activation of RhoA only requires phosphorylation of plexin-B1 by ErbB-2. These results provide novel insight into signaling pathways used by semaphorins and plexins and open new vistas for their cellular effects.</p>

Proteins from cell extracts were precipitated with anti-FLAG M2 mAb Agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-VSV-G Agarose affinity gel. In other experiments, we used antiâErbB-2 antibodies. Antibodyâantigen complexes were isolated by binding to protein A/GâSepharose followed by washing with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. Precipitated proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schuell) and blocking of nonspecific binding sites with 5% milk in TBST. Blots were probed with appropriate antibodies, and proteins were visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, blots probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies were treated with ECL reagent, and luminescence was scanned and quantified using a Fluoro-S-Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p>
