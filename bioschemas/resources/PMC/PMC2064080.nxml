      <abstract>
        <p>Vesicular traffic in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> oocyte occurs actively during vitellogenesis. Although endocytosis in the oocyte has been well characterized, exocytic vesicular traffic is less well understood. We show that the oocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) becomes concentrated into subcortical clusters during vitellogenesis. This ER reorganization requires Jagunal, which is an evolutionarily conserved ER membrane protein. Loss of Jagunal reduces vesicular traffic to the oocyte lateral membrane, but does not affect posterior polarized vesicular traffic, suggesting a role for Jagunal in facilitating vesicular traffic in the subcortex. Reduced membrane traffic caused by loss of Jagunal affects oocyte and bristle growth. We propose that ER reorganization is an important mechanism used by cells to prepare for an increased demand for membrane traffic, and Jagunal facilitates this process through ER clustering.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ER is a three-dimensional membranous network that extends throughout the cell, and is organized into discrete domains: the nuclear envelope, the smooth ER, and the rough ER. The ER participates in a variety of cellular functions, such as protein and lipid synthesis, the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, degradation of glycogen, and detoxification reactions (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baumann and Walz, 2001</xref>). The fine structure of the ER in any given cell may be organized depending on which of these functions predominates. For example, during myogenesis, the ER differentiates into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is an ER specialized in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Flucher, 1992</xref>). Proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER are transported to their destinations by the secretory pathway, and different cells use the secretory pathway to varying degrees. In addition, the amount of exocytic vesicular traffic may vary in a cell during development.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> oogenesis is a good model system to study how cells prepare for the varying requirements of vesicular transport activity. The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oocyte is interconnected with 15 nurse cells by ring canals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Cooley, 1996</xref>), and cytoplasm transported from nurse cells to the oocyte constitutes a major contribution to oocyte growth (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 1994</xref>). Another source for oocyte growth is yolk taken up during vitellogenesis (stages 8â10), when the oocyte becomes highly endocytic. During vitellogenesis, the rate of oocyte growth overtakes the rate of nurse cell growth such that, ultimately, the oocyte volume equals the total volume of the 15 nurse cells. In addition, a high density of microvilli forms on the oocyte surface during these stages (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mahowald, 1972</xref>). Therefore, a large amount of membrane must be added to the oocyte plasma membrane during vitellogenesis. However, mechanisms for increasing exocytic membrane trafficking is poorly understood.</p>

      <p>In this study, we identified a novel gene, <italic>jagunal</italic>, which is required for oocyte and bristle growth. The <italic>jagunal</italic> gene encodes a novel conserved ER membrane protein. We show that Jagunal is required for reorganizing the ER through ER clustering in the oocyte during vitellogenesis. The failure to reorganize the ER in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes results in reduced vesicular traffic and slowed cell growth. We propose that Jagunal is involved in reorganizing the ER in cells that must increase exocytic membrane traffic during development.</p>

        <title>Germline clones of <italic>jagunal</italic> exhibit defects in oocyte integrity and growth during stages 10 and 11</title>
        <p>After the completion of vitellogenesis, the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oocyte doubles its volume within 30 min to reach its maximum size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The final growth of the oocyte depends on rapid cytoplasm transport from nurse cells. Mutations that affect the ability of nurse cells to transport cytoplasm result in the production of small eggs (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mahajan-Miklos and Cooley, 1994</xref>); this phenotype has been referred to as âdumpless.â To identify essential genes involved in oocyte growth, we examined a collection of lethal mutations on chromosome 3R that were made (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yohn et al., 2003</xref>) and preselected for a small egg phenotype in Ruth Lehmann's laboratory at New York University (New York, NY). We found a mutation that severely affects oocyte growth and named it <italic>jagunal</italic> (<italic>jagn</italic>), which means small egg in Korean. Germline clones (GLCs) of <italic>jagunal (jagn<sup>Q21X</sup></italic>) showed a fully penetrant dumpless phenotype with severe defects in oocyte integrity. Four additional <italic>jagn</italic> alleles were isolated from a noncomplementation screen, three of which were lethal and one (<italic>jagn<sup>D16N</sup></italic>) that was semilethal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Homozygous mutant <italic>jagn<sup>Q21X</sup></italic>, <italic>jagn<sup>K38X</sup></italic>, and <italic>jagn<sup>W153X</sup></italic> animals died during the first and second instar larval stages. GLCs of <italic>jagn<sup>K38X</sup></italic> and <italic>jagn<sup>W153X</sup></italic> showed a dumpless phenotype.</p>
        <p>
<italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes appeared normal until stage 9. During stage 10, the anterior region of the oocyte began to detach from nurse cells and follicle cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, arrow). We examined the phenotype in live egg chambers using a protein trap line (G413) that produces a GFP fusion with Basigin (Bsg) and labels plasma membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Morin et al., 2001</xref>). In time-lapse images, Bsg-GFP allowed us to view both rapid oocyte growth caused by intercellular cytoplasm transport from nurse cells, and ooplasm streaming in the oocyte during stage 11 (Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.2007001048/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.2007001048/DC1</ext-link>). As observed in fixed egg chambers, live <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes expressing Bsg-GFP detached from other cells at the anterior region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, arrow). In severely affected mutant egg chambers, the oocyte detached from nurse cells completely and the cytoplasm of nurse cells leaked into the space between nurse cells and the oocyte (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, arrow; and Video 2). In more mildly affected egg chambers, the oocyte was connected to nurse cells, and intercellular cytoplasm transport proceeded to some extent during stage 11 (Video 3). However, the oocyte failed to grow to its maximum size. GLC phenotypes of <italic>jagunal</italic> were less severe in younger flies, likely because of the perdurance of wild-type gene products expressed before the formation of <italic>jagn</italic> mutant clones. Therefore, we focused on the phenotypes in egg chambers from females at least 7 d old.</p>

        <title>Jagunal is required for bristle growth and ridge structure</title>
        <p>To determine whether the growth defect caused by <italic>jagn</italic> mutations is oocyte specific, we examined the growth of <italic>jagn</italic> mutant bristles by making somatic cell clones. <italic>jagn</italic> mutant bristles were thinner and shorter than wild-type bristles. This defect was observed in several bristle types: wing anterior margin bristles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>), microchaetes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>), and macrochaetes (not depicted). <italic>jagn</italic> mutant bristles also exhibited a defect in their surface structure. During the development of bristles, the plasma membrane forms bulges between the 8â12 actin bundles associated with the plasma membrane, and the secretion of cuticle produces a ridged structure (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Overton, 1967</xref>). Wild-type bristles contain several parallel ridges with deep valleys between them, whereas <italic>jagn</italic> mutant bristles have a weak ridge structure with shallow valleys (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>, inset).</p>

        <title>The <italic>jagunal</italic> gene encodes a conserved protein with four predicted transmembrane domains</title>
        <p>The <italic>jagn</italic> mutation mapped to the chromosome interval 83C1- 83D4 as delineated by the proximal breakpoint of the noncomplementing deficiency <italic>Df(3)Tp110</italic> and the proximal breakpoint of the complementing deficiency <italic>Df(3R)Tp13</italic>. We mapped the <italic>jagn</italic> mutation further by single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping to within a 70-kb region containing 20 genes. By sequencing open reading frames of genes in the 70-kb interval, we identified mutation sites in all <italic>jagn</italic> alleles within a predicted gene, <italic>CG10978</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). The viability and fertility defects associated with all <italic>jagn</italic> alleles were rescued by ubiquitous expression of a <italic>CG10978</italic> cDNA, confirming that <italic>CG10978</italic> is <italic>jagn</italic>.</p>
        <p>
<italic>CG10978</italic> (<italic>jagn</italic>) encodes a protein of 197 amino acids with predicted homologues in the genomes of human, mouse, zebrafish, mosquito, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Jagunal shows 31% identity and 51% similarity to the human homologue. The first 40 amino acids of Jagunal are highly conserved, and a semilethal allele, <italic>jagn<sup>D16N</sup></italic>, is a missense mutation at a conserved Asp residue in the N-terminal region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, asterisk), suggesting that the N-terminal region has an important function. The protein has four predicted transmembrane domains and a putative dilysine motif at the C-terminal end (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, boxed area). The dilysine motif is known to be an ER-retention motif for ER membrane proteins (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 1993</xref>). Jagunal homologues in human and zebrafish match the consensus of the motif (KKXX), whereas arginine replaces lysine in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Jagunal (RKXX). However, the C-terminal sequence is likely to act as an ER retention motif; some substitutions of lysine by arginine are permitted in the dilysine motif (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale and Jackson, 1996</xref>), and interference with this sequence in Jagunal alters its localization (see the following section).</p>

        <title>Jagunal is an ER membrane protein and enriched in the oocyte subcortex during vitellogenesis</title>
        <p>To examine the subcellular localization of Jagunal, we made an antibody against Jagunal. Unfortunately, the antibody did not detect endogenous Jagunal proteins in ovaries by Western blotting or immunofluorescence. However, overexpressed Jagunal was detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), and because ectopic expression of Jagunal rescued the lethality of <italic>jagn</italic> mutations, the localization of ectopically expressed Jagunal likely reflects that of endogenous Jagunal. In Western blot analysis, overexpressed Jagunal migrated slightly faster than the expected molecular weight of 23 kD on a denaturing gel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, arrow); several background bands were also detected. In immunofluorescence, a strong signal was detected in cells overexpressing Jagunal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Jagunal colocalized with an ER marker, EYFP-ER (EYFP fused to the KDEL ER retention sequence; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the distribution of Jagunal showed a characteristic ER pattern during early stages, where it was enriched at the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Jagunal began to be enriched in the oocyte during stages 2â3, where it was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). During stages 9 and 10, Jagunal became concentrated in the oocyte subcortex adjacent to follicle cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and G</xref>). Double labeling revealed that Jagunal was on the cytoplasmic side of cortical actin filaments in the oocyte (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>, arrow).</p>

<bold>Localization of Jagunal in egg chambers.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis of wild-type (lane 1) and Jagunal-overexpressing (lanes 2 and 3) ovary extracts. The actin-Gal4 driver (lane 2) and germline triple drivers (lane 3) were used to overexpress Jagunal in the ovary. In wild-type extract, two nonspecific bands were detected, but endogenous Jagunal was barely visible. However, overexpressed Jagunal was detected (arrow). (B and Bâ²) Jagunal-overexpressing follicle cells were marked with GFP (indicated by a bar). Jagunal expression was elevated in GFP-positive cells (red). The follicle cells are shown with the basal membrane at the top. (CâE and G) Jagunal was overexpressed using the actin-Gal4 driver. (C) Jagunal is enriched at the nuclear envelope during early stages. (DâDâ³) Egg chambers expressing EYFP-ER (green) were stained for Jagunal (red). Jagunal colocalizes with EYFP-ER and becomes enriched in the oocyte during early stages. (E and G) Jagunal becomes enriched at the oocyte subcortex during stages 9 and 10 (arrows). (GâGâ³) Jagunal enriched at the oocyte subcortex (arrow) is near cortical actin, but does not colocalize with cortical actin. (F and J) Localization of Jagn-Venus in egg chambers.

        <p>Jagn-GFP and -Venus fusion proteins provided evidence for a functional ER retention motif. We made Jagn-GFP and -Venus transgenes by using a genomic DNA construct with GFP fused in-frame to the C-terminal end of Jagunal and with Venus fused in-frame between the first and second transmembrane domains, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I and J</xref>). Because the expression level of these proteins in ovaries was low, we used a GFP antibody to detect them. Jagn-Venus showed an ER distribution and was enriched in the oocyte subcortex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>), whereas Jagn-GFP localized at the plasma membrane, including ring canals and the oocyte plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>, arrow and arrowhead), in addition to the apparent ER localization. The aberrant localization of Jagn-GFP at the plasma membrane was also found in follicle cells during stage 10, when vesicular traffic occurs actively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I</xref>). In contrast, Jagn-Venus did not localize at the plasma membrane of follicle cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 J</xref>). The aberrant localization of Jagn-GFP at the plasma membrane likely results from loss of ER retention activity because GFP blocks the dilysine motif that must occupy the extreme C-terminal position to be functional (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, the Jagn-Venus transgene, but not the Jagn-GFP transgene, rescued the lethality of <italic>jagn</italic> alleles, further supporting the role of the dilysine motif in controlling the localization of Jagunal.</p>

        <title>Jagunal is required for establishing subcortical ER in the oocyte during vitellogenesis</title>
        <p>The fact that Jagunal is an ER membrane protein suggested that defects caused by <italic>jagn</italic> mutations might be caused by a defect in the ER. Therefore, we examined the distribution of several ER proteins in wild-type and <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes. In wild-type egg chambers, EYFP-ER, which is an ER luminal protein, was evenly distributed in the oocyte during stage 8, which is the earliest vitellogenic stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). However, beginning at stage 9, EYFP-ER became concentrated in the oocyte subcortical region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, arrow), and the enrichment continued through stage 10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, arrow), which is similar to distribution of Jagunal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). However, the enrichment of EYFP-ER in the subcortex was greatly reduced or eliminated in <italic>jagn</italic> GLCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>). We examined two other ER luminal proteins, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)âGFP (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bobinnec et al., 2003</xref>) and Boca. Boca is an ER chaperone and is required for correct folding of Yolkless (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Culi and Mann, 2003</xref>). Similar to EYFP-ER, these proteins also became concentrated in the oocyte subcortical region during stages 9 and 10 in wild-type egg chambers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, G and I, arrows). The enrichment of Boca and PDI-GFP was greatly reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes; instead, the proteins were uniformly distributed in ooplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, H and J</xref>). We also examined two ER membrane proteins, Sec61-Î±-GFP and Rtnl1 (reticulon-like)-GFP. Sec61-Î± is a component of the translocon that translocates proteins across ER membranes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and van Waes, 1999</xref>), and reticulons are ubiquitous ER membrane proteins proposed to stabilize highly curved ER membrane tubules (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to ER luminal proteins, GFP fluorescence showed that these ER membrane proteins became concentrated in the oocyte subcortical region in wild-type egg chambers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, K and M, arrows), and the enrichment was again greatly reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> liter and N). The concentration of all examined ER proteins in the oocyte subcortex suggests that the subcortical enrichment of ER proteins is not caused by uneven distribution of some ER proteins. Instead, the ER itself is likely to be concentrated in the subcortex. These results suggest that the ER is reorganized to produce a subcortical enrichment of the ER in the oocyte during vitellogenesis, and that Jagunal is required for this reorganization.</p>

        <title>Jagunal is required for clustering the ER in the oocyte during vitellogenesis</title>
        <p>During stages 9 and 10, ER proteins were concentrated into clusters in the subcortex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>â², arrow) in wild-type egg chambers. However, ER clusters were not found in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocyte subcortex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>â²). To further characterize ER organization in the oocyte during vitellogenesis, we examined ER organization in the ultrastructural level. In wild-type oocytes, the ER membranes were dispersed in the cytoplasm during stage 8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, arrows). However, beginning at stage 9, many ER clusters were found in the subcortical region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, arrow), corresponding to ER clusters observed by confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>â², arrow). Although some ER clusters were found far away from the oocyte cortex, the overall ER density was much lower deep inside the ooplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>â³) compared with the subcortical region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>â²), which is, again, consistent with the subcortical enrichment seen by confocal microscopy. The ER clusters continued to exist through stage 10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, arrow). However, ER clusters were not found in stage 12 oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>, arrows), suggesting that the clusters disassembled after completion of vitellogenesis. In addition to ER clustering, ER morphology changed during vitellogenesis. The ER luminal space increased during stages 9 and 10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>), compared with stages 8 and 12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and D</xref>).

        <title>The distributions of exocyst and Golgi complexes are not affected in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes</title>
        <p>The dramatic reorganization of the oocyte ER during stages 9 and 10 likely reflects a major increase in oocyte ER function needed for vitellogenesis and membrane expansion. To determine whether <italic>jagn</italic> mutations affect the organization of components downstream of ER in the exocytic membrane traffic pathway, we examined exocyst and Golgi complex localization. The exocyst complex is involved in targeting secretory vesicles to the appropriate exocytic sites on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2000</xref>), and two components of the exocyst complex, Sec5 and Sec8, localize at the oocyte plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, A and Aâ²; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murthy and Schwarz, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beronja et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast to Sec5, Sec8 does not localize at the interface of the oocyte and nurse cells (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beronja et al., 2005</xref>).

        <p>We used antibodies to Lava lamp, which is a golgin protein, to examine the distribution of Golgi complexes (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sisson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Papoulas et al., 2005</xref>). In wild-type egg chambers, Golgi complexes were enriched in the oocyte and distributed evenly throughout the ooplasm during stage 8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>), as previously reported (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Herpers and Rabouille, 2004</xref>). However, we found that many Golgi complexes began to accumulate in the subcortical region during stage 9 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>, arrowhead). The enrichment of Golgi complexes in the subcortical region became more evident during stage 10, with more Golgi near lateral plasma membranes compared with the posterior region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>, arrowhead). Because enrichment of Golgi in the subcortical region was not previously reported (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Herpers and Rabouille, 2004</xref>), we examined other Golgi markers, EYFP-Golgi (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al., 2004</xref>) and dCOG5-GFP, which is a subunit of the COG complex (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Farkas et al., 2003</xref>).

        <p>The presence of exocyst complexes at the oocyte plasma membrane and Golgi enrichment in the oocyte subcortex during stages 9 and 10 support the idea that membrane traffic to the oocyte surface increases during these stages.

        <title>Transport of Yolkless to the oocyte surface is reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes</title>
        <p>Although Jagunal is conserved in metazoans, yeast do not have a Jagunal homologue, indicating that Jagunal is not an essential component of secretory pathway. Indeed, GLCs of <italic>jagn</italic> did not show any evident defect in previtellogenic stages, as do GLCs of <italic>sec5</italic> and <italic>sec6</italic> (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murthy and Schwarz, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beronja et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that membrane trafficking is not blocked in mutant cells. Instead, Jagunal might be involved in increasing vesicular traffic to the oocyte surface during vitellogenesis by reorganizing the ER. To determine whether membrane traffic to the oocyte surface is reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes during vitellogenesis, we examined the localization of Yolkless in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes. Yolkless is the yolk receptor, and its presence at the cell cortex coincides with vitellogenesis. Yolkless is distributed uniformly in the oocyte during previtellogenic stages and begins to be transported to the oocyte surface with the onset of vitellogenesis during stage 8 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Schonbaum et al., 2000</xref>). Yolkless is transported to the oocyte plasma membrane by exocytosis, and it accumulates in the cortex as a result of endocytic recycling (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Schonbaum et al., 2000</xref>). As oogenesis proceeds, the intensity of Yolkless at the cortex increases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>); by stage 10, Yolkless is almost exclusively in the cortex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>).</p>

        <p>In <italic>jagn</italic> GLCs, the level of Yolkless in the oocyte lateral cortex was reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, DâF</xref>). The amount of Yolkless staining at the oocyte lateral cortex varied from near normal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>) to absent (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, D and F</xref>). Posterior enrichment of Yolkless in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes was most evident during stage 9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>, arrow), when 72% (39/54) of mutant oocytes showed a nonuniform cortical Yolkless distribution. Although we occasionally saw wild-type oocytes with a very weak posterior enrichment of Yolkless, the posterior enrichment of Yolkless was much stronger in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes. The behavior of Yolkless suggests that <italic>jagn</italic> mutations affect exocytic vesicular traffic to the oocyte lateral membrane. In addition, posterior enrichment of Yolkless in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes suggests the existence of a Jagunal-independent transport pathway polarized to the posterior pole. For example, the posterior enrichment of Yolkless may be caused, in part, by posterior-polarized endocytic recycling requiring Rab11 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dollar et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether endocytosis of yolk is affected in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes, we examined yolk granules in electron micrographs of stage 10 wild-type and <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes. Yolk granules were reduced in size and abundance in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, G and H</xref>). We measured the area of yolk granules in several egg chambers, and found that the overall area occupied by them was reduced by â¼70% in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes (from 29 to 9.3%; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 I</xref>). The amount of yolk in <italic>jagn</italic> oocytes varied widely, from 0 to 20% of oocyte area, but did not overlap wild-type amounts of yolk. To further examine endocytosis in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes, we quantitated the number of coated pits and vesicles in the plasma membrane and cortex of stage 10 oocytes. Compared with wild-type egg chambers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>), the number of coated pits and vesicles was reduced by â¼60% in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes (from 6.3 to 2.4 vesicles/Î¼m; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, DâF</xref> and G). Again, the amount of reduction varied, but numbers of coated pits and vesicles in <italic>jagn</italic> oocytes did not overlap wild type.

        <p>Considering that Jagunal is an ER membrane protein and <italic>jagn</italic> mutations affect ER organization during vitellogenesis, the decreased endocytosis in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes is likely to be caused by reduced transport of factors required for endocytosis (including Yolkless and membrane) to the oocyte surface.

Interestingly, we observed that microvilli were nearly absent on the surface of an oocyte that was detached from neighboring follicle cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 H</xref>, arrowheads).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A large number of essential components of vesicular traffic have been identified through genetic and biochemical approaches, particularly in yeast, where defects in secretion cause striking phenotypes. However, proteins that play essential roles in regulating or organizing vesicular traffic, particularly in higher eukaryotes, still remain to be elucidated. Information is particularly limited in the context of development, where patterns of vesicle traffic are modified according to developmental programs. The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oocyte undergoes a dramatic transition in vesicular traffic during vitellogenesis, which, in addition to its large size, makes it an ideal model system to study how cells reorganize vesicular traffic. GLC analysis makes it possible to examine lethal mutations for effects on oocyte development, and allowed us to identify an essential gene, <italic>jagunal</italic>, which is required for ER organization. The amino acid sequence of Jagunal, as well as its localization, indicates that Jagunal is an ER membrane protein. The defects caused by <italic>jagn</italic> mutations can be explained by a failure to reorganize the ER at key developmental steps, resulting in reduced vesicular trafficking. In the oocyte, this reduced membrane traffic ultimately results in the dramatic failure in cell expansion that was observed initially. Our study suggests a functional role of ER reorganization in regulating exocytic vesicular traffic, and offers the opportunity to elucidate molecular mechanisms of organizing ER clusters.</p>

        <title>Jagunal is required for clustering the ER</title>
        <p>Many examples illustrating the importance of ER reorganization during cell differentiation exist; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms used by cells to carry them out (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baumann and Walz, 2001</xref>). One well-documented example of ER reorganization occurs during oocyte maturation in diverse organisms (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kline, 2000</xref>). In mouse, 1â2-Î¼m-wide ER clusters become localized in the oocyte cortex during oocyte maturation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Mehlmann et al., 1995</xref>). The cortical ER clusters are presumed to be involved in calcium signaling. Similar ER clusters that might be involved with calcium signaling were reported in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> preblastoderm embryos (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Frescas et al., 2006</xref>). ER clustering could be a general mechanism to establish a highly dense ER domain; therefore, determining the mechanisms cells use for this change in ER organization is of central interest. We found evidence that the ER becomes concentrated in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oocyte subcortex during vitellogenesis, and accumulates into prominent clusters. The establishment of this highly dense ER domain requires Jagunal. Conservation of the <italic>jagunal</italic> gene in metazoans suggests a conserved role of Jagunal in ER clustering.</p>
        <p>A possible function of Jagunal might be inferred from other proteins with four transmembrane domains. Diverse protein families have this organization, including tetraspanins, tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins, and junctional proteins of either the gap junction (connexins) or tight junction (claudins and occludins; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Maecker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita and Furuse, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Falk, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 2002</xref>). One of the most remarkable similarities of these diverse proteins is their tendency to occur as homomultimers in specialized membrane domains, where they are enriched in dense molecular aggregates (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 2002</xref>). It is therefore attractive to postulate that Jagunal exists as a homomultimeric complex and/or binds to other membrane proteins to form a protein complex on ER membrane. Jagunal contains several charged or polar amino acids in its transmembrane domains, many of which are conserved among Jagunal homologues; these amino acids might be involved in binding to other membrane proteins.</p>
        <p>An intriguing feature of the amino acid sequence of Jagunal is the high conservation of the N-terminal 40 amino acids. The predicted topology of Jagunal places the amino terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. This domain could contribute to ER organization by binding cytoplasmic components such as cytoskeletal proteins, or by interacting with proteins within the ER that promote clustering. Identification of binding partners of the Jagunal N-terminal domain will provide clues to the role of Jagunal in ER reorganization.</p>

        <title>Oocyte ER reorganization mirrors a change in the location of exocytosis during vitellogenesis</title>
        <p>The phenotype of <italic>jagn</italic> germline clones reveals a modulation of ER function rather than a global block in membrane traffic. Mutations in exocyst components such as Sec5 and Sec6, which do block membrane traffic, cause a much more severe phenotype, in which egg chambers degenerate at an early stage (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murthy and Schwarz, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beronja et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, previtellogenic egg chambers mutant for <italic>jagn</italic> are normal. More subtle effects on ER exit sites caused by <italic>trailer hitch</italic> mutations result in abnormal aggregates of Gurken and Yolkless in the cytoplasm of oocytes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et al., 2005</xref>), which we did not observe in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes. The transport of Yolkless to the oocyte lateral membrane is reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes, but not blocked (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), and Gurken transport is not affected (not depicted).</p>
        <p>Our results suggest that membrane addition to the oocyte surface is reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes. Decreased membrane addition might be caused by a defect in ER-derived exocytic membrane traffic or a defect in endocytic recycling. However, a defect in endocytic recycling in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes is unlikely because we did not see an accumulation of Yolkless in the cytoplasm, as was seen in <italic>Rab11</italic> and <italic>sec5</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dollar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sommer et al., 2005</xref>). Instead, Yolkless protein in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes remained cortical.</p>
        <p>The oocyte plasma membrane is highly polarized in terms of membrane function during vitellogenesis. The anterior membrane is tightly attached to the four adjacent nurse cells and does not appear to be a site of active endocytosis. In contrast, the oocyte plasma membrane adjacent to follicle cells is highly endocytic with numerous pits or depressions of the plasma membrane between extensive microvilli (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Giorgi and Jacob, 1977</xref>). The posterior of the oocyte is a special subdomain with elevated endocytic activity (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cummings and King, 1970</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dollar et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, there is evidence pointing to the existence of a special exocytic pathway in the oocyte posterior. When human transferrin receptor is expressed in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> oocyte, its trafficking to the cell surface is restricted to the posterior cortex of the oocyte during stage 8. The posterior enrichment of transferrin receptor at this stage is not dependent on its mRNA localization (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bretscher, 1996</xref>). Given that vitellogenesis begins during stage 8, this result suggests that vesicular traffic is initially polarized to the posterior pole until vitellogenesis starts. The posterior exocytic pathway might be used to transport Gurken at the posterior pole before stage 8 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
        <p>The role of Jagunal may be to facilitate the transition from posterior-polarized secretion during previtellogenic stages to a uniform level of membrane trafficking in the lateral and posterior endocytic oocyte membrane during vitellogenesis. More specifically, membrane traffic to the lateral endocytic membranes is particularly dependent on Jagunal function. Many <italic>jagn</italic> oocytes accumulate Yolkless at the posterior, but fail to provide sufficient Yolkless to lateral endocytic membrane. The formation of the lateral endocytic subdomain coincides with the establishment of a subcortical ER domain and the enrichment of Golgi complexes near the endocytic membrane. The coincidence suggests that the ER and Golgi complexes in the subcortical region are involved in massive vesicular traffic to the plasma membrane adjacent to follicle cells. Jagunal may be involved in establishing a subcortical ER domain by clustering the ER in the subcortical region to increase ER density and vesicular traffic. The disappearance of ER clusters before stage 12 of oogenesis further suggests a specific role of ER clusters during vitellogenesis.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the enrichment of Golgi complexes in the subcortical region does not require <italic>jagn</italic>, suggesting that subcortical Golgi enrichment is not dependent on the subcortical ER. Golgi complexes might move to the oocyte subcortex along microtubules, as they do in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Papoulas et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

        <title>Jagunal is required for oocyte and bristle growth</title>
        <p>This study revealed that Jagunal is involved with ER reorganization; however, the final outcome for mutant oocytes and bristle cells is a failure to grow during development. Therefore, we need to understand how a defect in ER reorganization ultimately results in a growth defect. Previously characterized mutations that affect oocyte growth impede the flow of cytoplasm from nurse cells into the oocyte by affecting functions of nurse cells (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hudson and Cooley, 2002</xref>), emphasizing that nurse cell cytoplasm is essential for oocyte growth. However, the surface of the oocyte itself also has to expand to accommodate oocyte growth. This is especially critical during the final, rapid phase of nurse cell cytoplasm transport (dumping) that occurs during the 30-min stage 11. The oocyte surface also must more than double in size during this short time.</p>
        <p>There are at least two plausible mechanisms for providing enough membrane to the oocyte surface during dumping, either of which could require Jagunal. The first model is that membrane is added to the plasma membrane rapidly, perhaps by massive vesicle fusion. Given that ooplasm streams vigorously in the oocyte during this time (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Serbus et al., 2005</xref>), membrane reservoirs must exist near the cortex, where streaming does not occur. The second model is that a surplus of membrane is stored in advance as microvilli. In this model, the oocyte can expand rapidly by using the membrane of some microvilli during stage 11. If the ability to add membrane before or during dumping is reduced in <italic>jagn</italic> mutant oocytes, the rapid influx of nurse cell cytoplasm might result in excessive tension on the plasma membrane, finally causing detachment from adjacent cells and growth arrest.</p>
        <p>Similar models for membrane addition have been considered for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> cellularization, when the membrane surface area increases 25-fold in about 1 h (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fullilove and Jacobson, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Mahowald, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Loncar and Singer, 1995</xref>). Several lines of evidence support a dominant role of membrane trafficking for this process. For example, pulse-labeling experiments in living embryos showed polarized insertion of new membrane from a cytoplasmic reservoir during cellularization (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>). In addition, injection of brefeldin A, which inhibits ERâGolgi transport, reduces the speed of membrane invagination (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sisson et al., 2000</xref>). An open question is whether the organization of ER is important for membrane traffic during cellularization. Interestingly, before cellularization occurs, the ER becomes segregated into discrete units associated with each nucleus, ensuring that cells receive equal amounts of ER (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bobinnec et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Frescas et al., 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether this organization is crucial to membrane addition during cellularization, and if Jagunal is involved in creating the ER units.</p>
        <p>Bristle growth is also affected by <italic>jagn</italic> mutations, suggesting that Jagunal participates more generally in rapid cell growth. Both the small bristle phenotype and the defect in bristle ridge structure can be explained by reduced membrane trafficking. During pupal development, tiny bristles sprout and elongate for â¼16 h to reach their maximum length (65 Î¼m for microchaetes or 400 Î¼m for macrochaetes; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tilney et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, bristles elongate at an average rate of 4 Î¼m/h (microchaetes) or 25 Î¼m/h (macrochaetes) during the elongation period. Accordingly, a large amount of membrane must be added to the plasma membrane to accommodate this growth, and our results suggest a requirement for Jagunal during this process. Future work will be important to determine whether ER reorganization and elevated membrane traffic underlie bristle growth.</p>
