      <abstract>
        <p id="P6">X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a complex human disease that causes intellectual disability<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Causal mutations have been found in approximately 90 X-linked genes<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; however, molecular and biological functions of many of these genetically defined XLMR genes remain unknown. PHF8 (PHD Finger 8) is a JmjC domain-containing protein and its mutations have been found in patients with XLMR and craniofacial deformities. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8 as the first mono-methyl histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1) demethylase, with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2. PHF8 is located around the transcription start sites (TSS) of ~7,000 refseq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions (non-TSS). PHF8 depletion resulted in up-regulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the TSS and H3K9me2 in the non-TSS sites, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene expression, which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic domains. Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8 catalytic function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish developing brain and jaw development, thus providing a potentially relevant biological context for understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8 patients. Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supports a model whereby PHF8 regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw development in part by directly regulating the expression of the homeodomain transcription factor MSX1/MSXB, which functions downstream of multiple signaling and developmental pathways<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Our findings suggest that an imbalance of histone methylation dynamics plays a critical role in XLMR.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P7">XLMR affects 1â4 out of 2,000 males, causing intellectual disability (Intelligence Quotient (IQ) &lt;70)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Approximately 1/3 of them are syndromic patients in that they also have additional clinical symptoms including defects in craniofacial, muscular and hematopoietic development <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. About 25% of the XLMR genes identified by human genetic studies are predicted to encode nuclear proteins including transcriptional regulators and chromatin remodeling proteins <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. However, molecular mechanisms by which these proteins regulate biological processes relevant to the disease remain incompletely understood.</p>
    <p id="P8">PHF8 belongs to a subfamily of JmjC domain-containing proteins that also includes KIAA1718 and PHF2. All three proteins share a similar domain structure with an N-terminus PHD finger adjacent to the catalytic JmjC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), predicting that they are candidate histone demethylases. We used nucleosomes as substrates and identified a novel H4K20me1-specific demethylase activity for PHF8 and KIAA1718, with additional activities towards H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, but not H4K20me2/3 or trimethylated H3K9, 27 and 36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, when histone octomers were used as substrates, we were unable to detect the H4K20me1 demethylase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1</xref>), consistent with a number of recent reports that identified PHF8 as an H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2 specific demethylase<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. This discrepancy could be due to the use of nucleosomes versus histone octmers as substrates, and, as such, is not unprecedented. For instance, a number of histone methyltransferases have been shown to only methylate nucleosomal substrates or to methylate a specific lysine residue only in the nucleosomal context<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Importantly, the above <italic>in vitro</italic> demethylation reactions were also analyzed by mass spectrometry, which confirmed the Western blot results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c to h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, a point mutation in the catalytic domain (phenylalanine to serine, F279S) abolished PHF8 demethylase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), suggesting that the reduction of the H3K9me1/2 and H4K20me1 signals by the wild type PHF8 was due to its demethylase activity. The F279S mutation has been found in several male XLMR patients from a Finnish family<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, indicating the importance of the demethylase activity in PHF8-associated mental retardation.</p>
    <p id="P9">We next investigated the impact of PHF8 on the global H4K20 and H3K9 methylation states in the cells. PHF8 over-expression in U2OS but not HeLa cells, which express a high level of PHF8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>), resulted in a significant reduction of H3K9me2 (but not H3K9me1), and only a slight reduction of the global level of H4K20me1 (~10%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4, and Table 2</xref>). Although over-expression or RNAi of PHF8 in HeLa cells did not affect the global levels of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 assayed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 5a</xref>), we did observe an increase in the overall H4K20me1 level in the late G2/M and early G1 stages of the cell cycle when we inhibited PHF8 expression by RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 5b</xref>). This is consistent with the previous reports that H4K20me1 is cell cycle-regulated<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and provides further support that PHF8 regulates H4K20me1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, inhibition of PHF8 also reduced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>), suggesting a possible role for PHF8 in regulation of cell growth via histone demethylation.</p>
    <p id="P10">To identify the genomic locations of PHF8, we performed ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA deep sequencing). We obtained 17,293 peaks in HeLa cells after IgG normalization. Of those, 8,077 peaks representing 7,469 refseq genes are mapped to within 2.5 kb of TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Table 3</xref>) as well as 9,824 potential PHF8 binding events in the gene bodies (23.5%) and intergenic regions (33.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). This pattern of PHF8 genomic distribution was corroborated by ChIP-chip analysis. Importantly, majority of the PHF8 binding signals identified by ChIP-chip were erased by PHF8 RNAi, supporting the specificity of the PHF8 binding events detected by the PHF8 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figures 3, 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, the pattern of PHF8 binding around TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) resembles that of H3K4me3<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, consistent with the fact that the PHD domain of PHF8 binds H3K4me3<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Point mutations (Y7A, W29A, Y7A/Y14A, W29A/Y14A) that abolished binding of PHF8 to H3K4me3 <italic>in vitro</italic> disrupted its localization <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that PHF8 TSS localization may be dependent on its PHD domain recognizing H3K4me3. Importantly, analysis of the ChIP-seq and gene expression microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Table 6</xref>) shows that PHF8 binding events are positively correlated with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that PHF8 binds H3K4me3 and functions to promote gene transcription.</p>
    <p id="P11">We next used ChIP-seq to investigate histone methylation regulation by PHF8 at its direct loci using HeLa cells stably expressing either control or PHF8 shRNA. We found that PHF8 depletion caused a modest albeit significant increase in H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the PHF8 TSS target loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c and e</xref>), compared with the regions not bound by PHF8 (p-value &lt; 0.01), suggesting that PHF8 regulates transcription by demethylating H4K20me1 and H3K9me1. Unlike H4K20me1 and H3K9me1, H3K9me2 level remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). Interestingly, for the 9824 non-TSS PHF8 sites, we found that reduction of PHF8 is instead correlated with an increase in H3K9me2 (p-value &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>), but not H3K9me1 or H4K20me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2d and f</xref>), indicating that PHF8 may regulate non-TSS regions via demethylation of H3K9me2. Consistently, a recent study reported PHF8 regulation of rDNA transcription via demethylation of H3K9me2<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The finding that PHF8 may exhibit differential substrate specificities at different genomic locations (TSS versus non-TSS) implies that additional factors are involved in the regulation of PHF8 demethylase specificity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P12">To confirm the ChIP-seq histone modification data, we initially focused on three TSS-bound PHF8 target genes, FBXO7, TFAP2C and NCOA3, and first confirmed PHF8 binding near TSS (amplicon 2) by conventional ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3a and b</xref>). Inhibition of PHF8 resulted in up-regulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at amplicon 2 of the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). In some instances, we also observed an increase in H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 in amplicons #1 and 3 for reasons that are currently unclear. In contrast, we found no appreciable changes in H3K9me2, H3K27me1/2 or H3K36me1/2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>), many of which are also substrates of PHF8 <italic>in vitro</italic> (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figures 1 and 2</xref>). We also did not observe changes in histone H3, suggesting that the increase in H4K20me1/H3K9me1 is not due to an increase in nucleosome density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). We further investigated an additional seven PHF8 target genes and found H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 increase for some if not all of these targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>). We next investigated the impact of PHF8 inhibition on the expression of these three target genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>, Consistent with the bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>) implicating PHF8 as a positive regulator of transcription, their expression was down-regulated in PHF8 RNAi cells, restored by wild-type PHF8 but not by the patient F279 mutation or the H3K4me3-binding defective PHD finger mutant (Y7A, W29A). The expression of the addition seven genes was similarly reduced upon PHF8 inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that PHF8 demethylates H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that both H3K4me3-binding and catalytic functions of PHF8 are important for its ability to positively regulate gene expression.</p>
    <p id="P13">Although H4K20me1 has been found downstream of TSS on active genes<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, it has also been associated with repression and recruitment of L3MBTL1, which preferentially binds mono- and dimethylated lysines including H4K20me1 and H3K9me1<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and induces chromatin compaction to further negatively regulate gene expression<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Upon PHF8 knockdown, we also observed a corresponding increase of L3MBTL1 at amplicon 2 but not amplicons 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>). This is interesting in light of the fact that the H4K20me1 increase in PHF8 RNAi cells extends beyond amplicon 2, suggesting that factors, in addition to H4K20me1, are involved in determining L3MBTL1 recruitment. Additionally, we observed a reduction of H3K4me3, a mark that is associated with active genes, consistent with these genes being in a transcriptionally repressed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>). Taken together, these findings support the model that PHF8, when bound to TSS of the target genes, positively regulates transcription by demethylating H3K9me1 and H4K20me1.</p>
    <p id="P14">To address the biological function of PHF8, we turned to zebrafish where PHF8 is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>). zPHF8 expression was first detected at 14 hours post-fertilization (hpf) in the head and tail regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>), but starting at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf), zPHF8 was found mostly in the head region. zPHF8 expression was also detectable in the jaw of the embryo at 3 dpf. Injection of a zPHF8 morpholino caused delay in brain development at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>, compare panel b with a), and apoptosis in the developing brain and the neural tube at 30 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, compare panel b with a). Significantly, this apoptosis can be rescued by reintroduction of wild type but not catalytically inactive zPHF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, compare panels c, d with a, b). However, whether PHF8 regulates cell death by directly modulating the apoptotic machinery or indirectly through regulation of cell proliferation remains to be investigated. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether PHF8 also plays a role in post-mitotic mature neurons. In addition to apoptosis in the developing brain, we also detected significant differences in the craniofacial development between control and zPHF8 morpholino injected embryos at 3, 4 and 7 dpf, with the most pronounced defect being the absence of a lower jaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, compare panel a with b, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 13</xref>). To better understand the craniofacial developmental abnormality, we used Alcian blue to visualize the extent of cartilage development in these embryos. We found that the 1st through 5th pharyngeal arches were all either developmentally affected or were absent upon zPHF8 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, compare panel d,f with c,e). Specifically, the 1st pharyngeal arch had not migrated to the full extent of the lower jaw and the 2nd pharyngeal was inverted. The 3rd through 5th pharyngeal arches were also significantly under-developed. Importantly, wild type but not catalytically inactive zPHF8 showed significant rescue of the craniofacial defects induced by the zPHF8 morpholino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). Collectively, these findings identified a critical role of zPHF8 in zebrafish brain and craniofacial development, in a manner that is dependent on its demethylase activity.</p>
    <p id="P15">The msh/Msx gene family encodes homeodomain transcription factors that act downstream of the TGFÎ², BMP and WNT signaling pathways and play important roles in many developmental processes including craniofacial and neural development<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Zebrafish has five homologs, MSXA through MSXE, that constitute the zebrafish orthologs of the tetrapod MSX1, MSX2, and MSX3 genes<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, of which, MSX1 was identified as a PHF8 direct target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figures 14a and b</xref>). Interestingly, a MSXB morpholino produced craniofacial deformities similar to those seen in a zPHF8 morphant<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. We therefore investigated whether MSXB was regulated by zPHF8 and whether it functions to mediate the role of zPHF8 in zebrafish craniofacial development. We found that the <italic>msx</italic>B transcript level was reduced to 40% of wild-type level in embryos injected with a zPHF8 morpholino (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 14c</xref>). The <italic>msx</italic>B transcript was largely restored to wild type level in the animals rescued with zPHF8 mRNA encoding wild type but not with a catalytically inactive form of the zPHF8 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 14c</xref>). Importantly, injection of msxB mRNA also significantly corrected the craniofacial defects induced by the zPHF8 morpholino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, compare panels k, l with a, c and g, h). Although the rescue was not complete, the lower jaw developed better and the 2nd pharyngeal arch was no longer inverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, compare panels l with d and h, and data not shown). Similarly, the apoptosis seen in the developing brain and neural tube was also suppressed by forced expression of MSXB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, panel e). These findings raise the possibility that zPHF8 may control neuronal cell survival and craniofacial development at least in part by regulating MSXB expression. However, it is likely that MSXB is not the only PHF8 target gene that mediates PHF8 biology. Consistent with this idea, bioinformatics analysis of the expression microarray data from HeLa cells identified additional potential PHF8 target genes in a number of pathways including RA (Retinoic Acid) and Notch signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Table 6</xref>), both of which have been previously shown to play a role in neural and craniofacial development<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and therefore may also be involved in PHF8 biological functions. In addition, the PHF8 direct target genes (FBXO7, NCOA3 and TFAP2C) discussed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) also function in neural development<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Lastly, ChIP-seq/ChIP-chip identified many XLMR genes as potential PHF8 direct targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 15</xref>), consistent with a recent report<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. This finding raises the interesting possibility of a connection between PHF8 and other XLMR gene products in regulating cognitive functions. However, given that the ChIP-seq data were obtained from heterologous cells, whether PHF8 regulation of other XLMR genes is physiologically and pathologically relevant remains to be investigated.</p>
    <p id="P16">In conclusion, we have identified the XLMR gene PHF8 to encode a novel H4K20me1 and H3K9me1/2 demethylase, and provided insights into molecular mechanisms by which PHF8 regulates histone methylation and gene transcription. The identification of a role for PHF8 in zebrafish brain apoptosis and craniofacial development suggests a potential biological basis for the involvement of PHF8 mutations in mental retardation and craniofacial deformities. Importantly, our finding of PHF8 as a histone demethylase whose mutations are correlated with XLMR supports the emerging theme of a critical link between histone methylation dynamics in X-linked mental retardation.</p>

The density in the promoter regions was profiled with 500-bp windows after aligning to TSS (Â±5 kb). The same window size was applied to the 5-kb downstream regions of transcription ending sites (TES). Profiles in gene body were generated by aligning genes in each bin relative to TSS + 5 kb and TES, and with a window size of 10% of the region length. The densities were normalized against the size of Chip-Seq library and the size of sliding windows.</p>
        <p id="P29">To detect changes of histone modifications in PHF8 RNAi cells, we aligned ChIP-seq tags according to the centers of PHF8 sites and manipulated the modification densities with a 50-bp window. As a control, we randomly chose 3,000 non-PHF8 sites from promoter regions [Â±2.5 kb of TSS] and non-TSS regions, respectively. To reduce noise from the background, following the procedures described in <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, we filtered the tags outsides of the modification enriched regions determined by SICER before calculating the densities (window =200, gap =1000, E-value =1000). To test the significance of modification changes, we averaged the fold change of densities within a region 2.5 kb around the PHF8 site for each modification, and compared it with an expectation to calculate a p-value (t-test). The expectation was estimated by the ratio of tag number from control RNAi to PHF8 RNAi (normalized by library sizes) in the promoter and non-promoter regions.</p>

        <title>Zebrafish PHF8 vectors, in situ hybridization, zPHF8 knockdown and phenotypic analysis</title>
        <p id="P31">Zebrafish PHF8 (zPHF8) was cloned by RT-PCR. The coding protein, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>, is shorter at the C-terminus than human PHF8 and the predicted zPHF8, and differences in the coding region were also noticed. pCS-N-HA- zPHF8 was cloned and H323Y mutation was introduced into this vector. pBSKS-zPHF (corresponding to PHF8 cDNA nucleotides 1868â2505) was used to generate a cRNA probe. Whole-mount zebrafish embryo in situ hybridizations using digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense zPHF8 RNA probes were carried out following the method described previously <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. A morpholino (MO) targeting â2 to +23 of zPHF8 (5â-CAGTAAACCGGAACAGATGCCATTC-3â) and control Morpholino (5âCCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA 3â) were obtained from Gene-Tools, LLC.</p>
        <p id="P32">Zebrafish embryos injected at the 1 cell stage with 2nl of 250uM control or PHF8 morpholino with or without 200ng of GFP, zPHF8, or zMSXb mRNA were injected using a gas-driven microinjector (Medical Systems Corp). For in vivo detection of cell death, live 30 hpf embryos were incubated in 2 Âµg/ml acridine orange (Sigma) in embryo media in the dark for 30 min and washed three times in fresh embryo media, and fluorescence was observed under 488 nm wavelength excitation. Pharyngeal arches were stained with Alcian blue.</p>

This labeling induces a 5 Da mass shift between the two samples, which is observed as a 2.5 m/z shift for doubly charged peptides. The m/z ranges depicting peptides are indicated. Decreases in H3K9me1 (c), H3K9me2 (d) and H4K20me1 (f) were detected from the PHF8 reaction compared to GST only. No changes were observed in others.</p>
