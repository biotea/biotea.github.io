          <title>Purpose:</title>
          <p>Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is typically inherited in an
autosomal dominant manner, but rare X-linked families have been described. So far,
the only known X-linked gene is <italic>FLNA</italic>, which is associated with the
periventricular nodular heterotopia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However,
mutations in this gene explain only a small number of X-linked TAAD families.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>We performed targeted resequencing of 368 candidate genes in a cohort of 11
molecularly unexplained Marfan probands. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing of
<italic>BGN</italic> in 360 male and 155 female molecularly unexplained TAAD probands
was performed.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>We found five individuals with loss-of-function mutations in <italic>BGN</italic> encoding
the small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan. The clinical phenotype is
characterized by early-onset aortic aneurysm and dissection. Other recurrent
findings include hypertelorism, pectus deformity, joint hypermobility,
contractures, and mild skeletal dysplasia. Fluorescent staining revealed an
increase in TGF-Î² signaling, evidenced by an increase in nuclear pSMAD2 in
the aortic wall. Our results are in line with those of prior reports demonstrating
that Bgn-deficient male BALB/cA mice die from aortic rupture.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion:</title>
          <p>In conclusion, <italic>BGN</italic> gene defects in humans cause an X-linked syndromic
form of severe TAAD that is associated with preservation of elastic fibers and
increased TGF-Î² signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are often asymptomatic but predispose to aortic
dissections, which are associated with high mortality rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> TAAs and dissections (TAAD) can be subdivided into syndromic
(associated with systemic manifestations) and nonsyndromic forms. Most commonly,
familial TAADs segregate in an autosomal dominant manner, but rare X-linked families
have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> So far, <italic>FLNA</italic>
is the only X-linked gene associated with a syndromic form of TAAD, namely,
periventricular nodular heterotopia type 1 (PVNH1; also known as the
Ehlers-Danlos variant of PVNH, MIM300049). However, <italic>FLNA</italic> explains only a
small number of the X-linked TAAD families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Marfan syndrome (MFS; MIM154700) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue
disorder; affected individuals present with ocular, skeletal, and cutaneous signs
in addition to aneurysm and dissection. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS; MIM609192,
MIM610168, MIM613795, MIM614816, MIM615582, and MIM601366) is an aneurysmal
connective tissue disorder that can be distinguished from MFS by the unique presence
of craniofacial, skeletal, cutaneous, and/or vascular manifestations and prominently
includes hypertelorism, cleft palate, or bifid uvula and arterial tortuosity, with
aneurysms distant from the aortic root. In addition, aneurysms in individuals with
LDS tend to dissect at an earlier age and smaller diameter compared to individuals
with MFS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Whereas MFS is caused by
mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> coding for an extracellular matrix (ECM)
protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> LDS is caused by
loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in genes coding for components of the transforming
growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling pathway (<italic>TGFBR1/2</italic>,
<italic>SMAD2/3</italic>, <italic>TGFB2/3</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>
Recent work has demonstrated that both MFS and LDS lead to dysregulation of the
TGF-Î² signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup></p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>BGN</italic> mutations in syndromic TAAD
probands</title>
        <p>After targeted resequencing of 368 ECM-related and TGF-Î²-related genes in a
cohort of 11 molecularly unexplained Marfan probands, we identified two
individuals with mutations in <italic>BGN</italic> encoding the ECM small leucine-rich
proteoglycan (SLRP) biglycan. In the proband (1-III-1) of family 1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>), we identified a novel nonsense mutation
at amino acid position 2 (c.5G&gt;A, p.Trp2*, ClinVar accession number
SCV000266568), and we identified a novel missense variant at the exonâintron
boundary of exon 7 (A in AGgt of the donor splice site) in the proband (2-II-1) of
family 2 (c.908A&gt;C, p.Gln303Pro, ClinVar accession number SCV000266569). Only a
minor effect was predicted on splicing (<bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold> online), but
no skin fibroblasts of the proband of family 2 were available to investigate
potential aberrant splicing. However, the mutation substitutes a highly conserved
amino acid (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary Table
S2</bold> online). </p>
        <p>Subsequently, we performed Sanger sequencing of <italic>BGN</italic> in 360 male and 155
female TAAD probands negative for mutations in the known TAAD genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Because we were unable to amplify exons 2 to
8 of the <italic>BGN</italic> gene in the male probands (3-III-1 en 4-II-1) of families 3
and 4 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>), we suspected a partial
hemizygous gene deletion. The latter was confirmed by microarray analysis
(<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>).We further delineated these
deletions by PCR and Sanger sequencing across the breakpoints. In family 3, we
identified a 21-kb deletion spanning chrX:152767424-152787984 (ClinVar accession
number SCV000266570) and comprising exons 2 to 8 of <italic>BGN</italic>. In family 4, we
identified a larger deletion comprising 28âkb and spanning
chrX:152768438-152795976 (ClinVar accession number SCV000266571), but also
deleting exons 2 to 8 of <italic>BGN</italic>. In the male proband (5-II-1) of family 5
(<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>), we identified a novel
missense mutation at the exonâintron boundary of exon 2, which was predicted
to lead to aberrant splicing because the donor splice site was affected
(c.238G&gt;A, p.Gly80Ser, ClinVar accession number SCV000266572, <bold>Supplementary
Table S2</bold> online). </p>
        <p>We subsequently sequenced cDNA from skin fibroblasts of proband 5-II-1 cultured
with and without puromycin, a translational inhibitor that will stabilize
out-of-frame transcripts that are normally destined to undergo nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay (NMD). Three alternatively spliced products were observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold>). Of the total amount of <italic>BGN</italic>
transcript, only 8% shows normal splicing. The first alternative product (4%
representation) incorporates 45âbp of the intron without creating a
premature stop codon. The remaining two alternatively spliced products incorporate
111 and 368âbp of the intron (with 68 and 20% representation, respectively)
and do introduce a premature stop codon leading to NMD.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, all identified mutations are predicted to lead to a partial or
complete loss of function of BGN through absence of a functional copy of the gene,
through NMD, or through predicted functional changes to protein function
(<bold>Supplementary Table S3</bold> online).</p>

        <title>Clinical data</title>
        <p>The clinical phenotype of the individuals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure
3</xref></bold>) with <italic>BGN</italic> mutations is characterized by early-onset
aortic aneurysm (as early as age 1; 4-II-1) and dissection (earliest at the
age of 15; 3-III-1) in male probands. In all five families, either the aortic
root or the more distal ascending aorta was involved. In one family, we also
observed brain aneurysms in one individual (5-I-2; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). Although the mitral and aortic valves were
involved in some families (e.g., 2-III-1 and 4-I-2), insufficiency was mild. The
cardiovascular phenotype in mutation-carrying females ranged from unaffected upon
repeated echocardiographic evaluation (3-II-2 and 3-I-2) over aortic root
dilatation (4-I-2 and 5-I-2) to death due to aortic dissection (1-II-1). The
initial suspected clinical (differential) diagnoses varied between MFS (families 1
and 2), LDS (families 3, 4, 5), and Melnick-Needles syndrome and filaminopathy
(families 3 and 4). </p>
        <p>We observed nonspecific connective tissue features (e.g., pectus deformities,
joint hypermobility/contractures, and striae) and more specific manifestations of
LDS (e.g., bifid uvula, hypertelorism, and cervical spine instability) in affected
individuals. The stature of the affected patients in this series ranged from short
(e.g., 3-III-2 and 4-II-1) to normal to high normal (e.g., 1-III-1, 2-III-1 and
5-II-1) when compared to unaffected family members. Similarly, either long fingers
(families 1 and 2) or rather short, broad fingers (families 3 and 4, 5-I-2;
<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold>) were noted. Other unusual
features not typically seen in MFS or LDS include ventricular dilatation on brain
imaging (families 3 and 4), hypertrichosis (family 3), gingival hypertrophy
(family 4), and relative macrocephaly (families 3 and 4). There is also evidence
of skeletal dysplasia with hip dislocation (families 3 and 4), platyspondyly
(family 3), phalangeal dysplasia (families 3 and 4), and dysplastic epiphyses of
the long bones (family 3; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold>). A

        <title>Structural and functional changes in the aortic wall</title>
        <p>To investigate the collagen and elastic fiber contents of the aortic walls, we
stained aortic walls from affected (3-III-2 and 5-II-1) and control individuals
with Verhoeff-Van Gieson and Trichrome Masson. The staining revealed low to normal
collagen content; elastin fibers appeared normal (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure
4a</xref></bold>â<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">h</xref></bold>). This is in
contrast to what is observed in LDS individuals, in whom an increase in collagen
production and fragmentation of elastic fibers are typically present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Next, we fluorescently stained the aortic tissue of the affected probands for
biglycan (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref></bold>â<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">l</xref></bold>). As expected, no protein expression was detected in proband
3-III-2 because this proband had a deletion of <italic>BGN</italic>. We observed a subtle
expression of biglycan in proband 5-II-1 that was related to the predicted
expression of a small amount of wild-type (WT) spliced protein. Interestingly, in
individuals with LDS (<italic>TGFB3</italic> mutation, p.Asp263His), we specifically
observed expression of biglycan in areas with disorganization of the arterial
structure. The latter is different than what has been described before in patients
with ascending aortic aneurysms of unknown genetic origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p>
        <p>To investigate whether decorin expression was altered in <italic>BGN</italic>-deficient
patients, we performed immunohistological staining of the aortic walls. Decorin is
another member of the class I SLRP, which displays an essential role in the
formation and deposition of collagen fibrils and was previously suggested to be
able to compensate for biglycan loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup>
We confirmed focal expression of decorin in the media of the aortic walls of
individuals with a BGN mutation (<bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold> online) that was
comparable to what has been described in aortic aneurysm patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Because BGN has also been suggested to be a regulator of TGF-Î²
signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and because we observed marked phenotypic similarities
with MFS and LDS, we hypothesized that an increase in TGF-Î² signaling could
also underlie the phenotype seen in individuals with a <italic>BGN</italic> mutation.
Therefore, we stained pSMAD2, a specific marker of activated canonical TGF-Î²
signaling (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref></bold>â<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">p</xref></bold>). We observed an increase of pSMAD2-positive
nuclei compared to controls, thus confirming an increase in TGF-Î² signaling.
In addition, a gradient of increased nuclear pSMAD2 staining toward the adventitia
was observed in proband 3-III-2 (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold> online). The
increased TGF-Î² signaling in the media was comparable to the LDS-affected
individual.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The <italic>BGN</italic> gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and encodes the biglycan
protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Biglycan belongs to the
SLRP class I proteins and, together with other proteoglycans such as decorin, is
mainly involved in ECM assembly and maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> It consists of a small protein core
(~42âkDa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> that contains 10
leucine-rich repeats (LRR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> with two
tissue-specific chondroitin or dermatan-sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains
attached to two Ser-Gly sites in the N-terminus of the core protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Through the
core protein and GAG chains, biglycan interacts with many other ECM proteins,
including collagen type I, II, III, and VI and elastin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> In this manner, biglycan
becomes sequestered in the ECM of most organs; its role seems to be not only that
of a mechanical link between matrix components but also that of growth factor binding
and regulation of signaling. In healthy individuals, biglycan is expressed by various
specialized cell types, including endothelial cells, skeletal myocytes, and
differentiating keratinocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> It is
widely expressed in various tissues throughout the body, including bone, skin, heart,
lung, and arteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> In the aorta, biglycan is present in the intima and the
media,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> but the adventitia is the
major site of deposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Due to the suggested structural role of biglycan, we performed histological staining
to assess the architecture of the aortic wall. We observed a normal appearance of
elastic fibers and low to normal collagen content in the aortic wall of our probands.
This is in contrast to what has been described for MFS and LDS aortic tissue, where
an increase in collagen content and an increase in elastic fiber breaks are typically
observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> As observed in
<italic>bgn</italic>-deficient mice, we hypothesize that proper functioning of biglycan is
necessary for correct collagen fibril diameters and lateral association of fibers
rather than collagen amount.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In addition to its structural role, biglycan interacts with several growth factors
and cytokines, including TGF-Î²,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> to modulate proliferation, migration, and
differentiation of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> This regulatory
function resembles that of fibrillin-1, which also forms a reservoir for latent
TGF-Î².<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Our results indicate that
lack of biglycan increases TGF-Î² signaling, especially in the adventitia, the
major site of biglycan deposition in the aortic wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> This may explain why <italic>BGN</italic> deficiency has a more
pronounced effect on TGF-Î² signaling in this layer of the aortic
wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Until now, the upregulation
of TGF-Î² signaling in other syndromic forms of TAAD, like MFS and LDS, has
mainly been studied in the media of the aortic wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In individuals with a <italic>BGN</italic> mutation, we observed a
slight increase in TGF-Î² signaling in the media; however, this increase was
significantly more pronounced in the adventitia (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>
online). The increase in TGF-Î² signaling is expected to lead to an increased
transcription of collagen, but proper collagen fibril assembly may be hampered by
biglycan deficiency. Our findings of increased TGF-Î² signaling are in line with
prior observations of enhanced SMAD2 phosphorylation in bgn+/â cardiac
fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> The latter induced
differentiation into a pro-proliferative myofibroblast phenotype that is rescued by
TGF-Î² neutralizing antibodies. </p>
      <p>The absence of an aortic phenotype in the pure C57Bl6 <italic>Bgn</italic>-deficient
mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> confirms our hypothesis of
increased TGF-Î² signaling as the driving pathogenetic mechanism of the aortic
aneurysm development. The C57Bl6 mouse background is believed to induce a relative
deficiency state for TGF-Î² signaling and, as such, attenuates high TGF-Î²
signaling in <italic>Bgn</italic>-deficient aortic walls. Only in male BALB/cA mice does
biglycan deficiency lead to sudden death from aortic rupture, indicating that
biglycan is both structurally and functionally essential for the integrity of the
aortic wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> The molecular mechanism for
the difference between the pure C57Bl6 and the BALB/cA backgrounds remains
unknown.</p>
      <p>As a consequence of the mice studies discussed, biglycan gene defects were predicted
to play a potential role in the pathogenesis of aortic dissection and rupture in
humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Yet, this study is the
first to report <italic>BGN</italic> mutations in TAAD probands. In <italic>Bgn</italic> knockout
mice, aortic elastic lamella did not display any structural changes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> similar to the human <italic>BGN</italic> probands.
These normal elastic fibers can potentially be explained by the ability of decorin to
substitute for biglycan in pathological contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Decorin is another member of the class I SLRP, which
displays an essential role in the formation and deposition of collagen fibrils and,
like biglycan, is able to bind tropoelastin, fibrillin-1, and microfibril-associated
glycoprotein 1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> However, its expression pattern is somewhat different from
that of biglycan and, depending on the tissue, its synergistic or additive effects
with biglycan can differ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>
<italic>Bgn</italic>/<italic>Dcn</italic> double-knockout mice on a 129Sv/C57BL6 background have been
generated, but an aortic phenotype has not been extensively studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> As such, it might be interesting to study the
aortic phenotype of the <italic>Bgn</italic>/<italic>Dcn</italic> double-knockout mice on a BALB/cA
background.</p>
      <p>In addition to their cardiovascular phenotype, <italic>Bgn</italic>-deficient mice have also
been reported to show a phenotype characterized by growth failure, reduced bone
formation, and age-related severe osteopenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Previous research has indicated that the expression levels of
biglycan are potentially related to stature in humans: patients with Turner syndrome
have low levels of biglycan and typically display short stature, whereas patients
with triple X syndrome present with increased limb length and high levels of
biglycan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> In families 3 and 4,
affected male individuals presented short stature (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref></bold>) and mild skeletal dysplasia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure
3b</xref></bold>), confirming a role for biglycan in human bone development.</p>
      <p>From a clinical perspective, the phenotype of <italic>BGN</italic>-mutated individuals
overlaps with LDS and MFS individuals. Typical LDS features in families 3 and 4
include pronounced hypertelorism, bifid uvula, and early-onset aortic dissections.
The probands of families 1 and 2 were initially diagnosed with MFS, but they also
displayed LDS-like features such as hypertelorism. The phenotype of the carrier
females ranges from unaffected upon repeated echocardiographic examination (3-II-2
and 3-I-2) over aortic root dilatation (4-I-2 and 5-I-2) to death due to aortic
dissection (1-II-1). Overall, the noncardiovascular characteristics of the female
carriers seem milder. To determine whether skewed X inactivation underlies the
difference between affected and unaffected females, we performed X-inactivation
experiments using the HUMARA assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The
results did not reveal a clear pattern of skewed X inactivation that could explain
the observed difference (data not shown). </p>
      <p>The phenotypic features in families 3 and 4 seemed more pronounced than in the other
families. Complete LOF cannot explain this difference between the families because we
also expect a complete LOF in family 1 due to the stop codon at the second amino acid
position (even if the first downstream ATG would be used as an alternative start
codon, the resulting protein would miss the signal and the propeptide of biglycan,
and thus still lead to LOF). However, the deletion occurring in families 3 and family
4 extends beyond exons 2â8 of <italic>BGN</italic> and includes a region downstream of
the <italic>BGN</italic> gene that contains a CpG island and, in addition, the untranslated
region (5Ê¹-UTR) of two alternative protein coding transcripts of the
downstream gene <italic>ATP2B3</italic>. So far, mutations in <italic>ATP2B3</italic> are linked to
an X-linked form of spinocerebellar ataxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> and therefore cannot be
directly linked to the phenotype of the <italic>BGN</italic> probands. Nonetheless,
(intronic) regulatory elements may play a role in the expression of the phenotype and
explain the observed difference. The milder phenotype in family 5 could be correlated
with 8% residual expression of WT spliced biglycan protein.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results confirm that <italic>BGN</italic> gene defects in humans cause an
X-linked syndromic form of severe TAAD. The identification of mutations in
<italic>BGN</italic> contributes to the molecular diagnosis of X-linked TAAD and should
therefore be implemented in diagnostics. The signature of increased TGF-Î²
signaling in the aortic walls of the <italic>BGN</italic>-deficient patients offers an
interesting therapeutic target for TGF-Î² activity attenuating agents such as
angiotensin receptor blockers.</p>

malar flattening, down-slanting palpebral fissures (3-II-2/3/4, 3-III-1/2, and

fingers (3-III-1/2), and camptodactyly of fingers and toes (3-III-1/2). (<bold>b</bold>)
Skeletal survey of patient 3-III-1 at age 10 years and of patient 4-II-1 at age
1.5 years. Radiograph of both hands (3-III-1) reveals asymmetry in the size of the
carpal bones, with the ones on the right being larger. Overall, there is symmetric
shortening and broadening of the metacarpals and phalanges that appear osteopenic
with relatively thin cortices. Lateral view of the spine (3-III-1) demonstrates
platyspondyly with thoracolumbar transition mild anterior tonguing.
Anteroposterior view of the lower limbs (3-III-1) shows that the distal
(sub)metaphyseal region of the femur is widened and the knee epiphyses are
flattened. There is also mild undermodeling of the tibia with an S-shape
configuration of the diaphysis. The distal tibial epiphysis is dysplastic.
Skeletal radiographs of proband 4-II-1 reveal bilateral hip dislocation (treated
conservatively), broadened and triangular middle phalanges, broad terminal
phalanges, and a broad thorax.</p>

Gieson staining of the control sample (<bold>a</bold>), proband 3-III-2 (<bold>b</bold>),
proband 5-II-1 (<bold>c</bold>), and an individual with LDS (<bold>d</bold>). The elastin
fibers in proband 3-III-2 do not show any clear breaks. In the tissue from the
individual with LDS, a clear reduction in the elastic fiber content is present.
Scale bar indicates 5âmm. (<bold>eâh</bold>) Trichrome Masson staining of
the control sample (<bold>e</bold>), proband 3-III-2 (<bold>f</bold>), proband 5-II-1
(<bold>g</bold>), and an individual with LDS (<bold>h</bold>). A clear reduction of
collagen content is present in proband 3-III-2, whereas an increase is observed in
the individual with LDS. (<bold>iâl</bold>) Biglycan staining of the control
sample (<bold>i</bold>), proband 3-III-2 (<bold>j</bold>), proband 5-II-1 (<bold>k</bold>), and an
individual with LDS (<bold>l</bold>). Biglycan is not expressed in proband 3-III-2,
whereas in proband 5-II-1 some residual expression of biglycan is present. In the
proband with LDS, focal increased expression of biglycan can be observed. Scale
bar indicates 25 Âµm. (<bold>mâp</bold>) pSMAD2 staining of the control
sample (<bold>m</bold>), proband 3-III-2 (<bold>n</bold>), proband 5-II-1 (<bold>o</bold>), and an
individual with LDS (<bold>p</bold>). No pSMAD2-positive nuclei are present in the
control sample. In proband 3-III-2, proband 5-II-1, and the proband with LDS, an
increase in pSMAD2-positive nuclei can be observed.</p>
