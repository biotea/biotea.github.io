      <abstract>
        <p>Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a rare genetic disorder of the skin characterized by abnormal desquamation over the whole body. In this study we report four patients from three consanguineous Tunisian families with skin, eye, heart, and skeletal anomalies, who harbor a homozygous contiguous gene deletion syndrome on chromosome 15q26.3. Genome-wide SNP-genotyping revealed a homozygous region in all affected individuals, including the same microdeletion that partially affects two coding genes (<italic>ADAMTS17</italic>, <italic>CERS3</italic>) and abolishes a sequence for a long non-coding RNA (<italic>FLJ42289</italic>). Whereas mutations in <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> have recently been identified in autosomal recessive Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome in humans and dogs presenting with ophthalmologic, cardiac, and skeletal abnormalities, no disease associations have been described for <italic>CERS3</italic> (ceramide synthase 3) and <italic>FLJ42289</italic> so far. However, analysis of additional patients with non-syndromic ARCI revealed a splice site mutation in <italic>CERS3</italic> indicating that a defect in ceramide synthesis is causative for the present skin phenotype of our patients. Functional analysis of patient skin and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated keratinocytes demonstrated that mutations in <italic>CERS3</italic> lead to a disturbed sphingolipid profile with reduced levels of epidermis-specific very long-chain ceramides that interferes with epidermal differentiation. Taken together, these data present a novel pathway involved in ARCI development and, moreover, provide the first evidence that CERS3 plays an essential role in human sphingolipid metabolism for the maintenance of epidermal lipid homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a heterogeneous group of human keratinization disorders mainly characterized by generalized abnormal scaling of the skin. To date, positional cloning and homozygosity mapping of families with ARCI have identified disease-associated mutations in seven genes: <italic>ABCA12</italic>, <italic>ALOX12B</italic>, <italic>ALOXE3</italic>, <italic>CYP4F22</italic>, <italic>ICHTHYIN</italic>, <italic>PNPLA1</italic>, and <italic>TGM1</italic>. The reported molecular mechanisms underlying disease development are related to defects in epidermal lipid pathways that interfere with terminal keratinocyte differentiation and skin barrier function. In this study we used genome-wide SNP mapping, which identified homozygous mutations in the <italic>CERS3</italic> (ceramide synthase 3) gene that cause a new type of ARCI. Functional analysis of a skin sample and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated keratinocytes from one patient demonstrated that mutated CERS3 impairs the synthesis of ceramides with very long-chain acyl moieties. The defect in sphingolipid metabolism disturbs the epidermal lipid profile, which leads to an abnormal terminal differentiation process. In summary, mutations in <italic>CERS3</italic> are causative for ARCI and illustrate the important role of ceramide synthesis in human skin physiology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is characterized by abnormal desquamation over the whole body due to a dysfunctional skin permeability barrier and an altered lipid composition of the skin. To date, in our collection of about 550 families presenting with ARCI we identified mutations in seven different genes, which can cause non-syndromic forms of ARCI: <italic>ABCA12</italic>, <italic>ALOXE3</italic>, <italic>ALOX12B</italic>, <italic>CYP4F22</italic>, <italic>ICHTHYIN</italic>, <italic>PNPLA1</italic>, and <italic>TGM1</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Lefvre1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> in about 80% of the patients; the remaining 20% of patients are expected to carry mutations in other genes, which remain to be identified <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we present a new contiguous gene deletion syndrome affecting the sequences of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic>, <italic>FLJ42289</italic>, and <italic>CERS3</italic> in four patients from three consanguineous families from our collection. The clinical phenotype of the affected individuals partly corresponds to the characteristic manifestation of Weill-Marchesani (WM)-like syndrome (MIM 613195) that has been found to be caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> (<underline>a</underline>

However, the present ichthyosis skin phenotype of our patients has never been reported in WM-like syndrome patients, suggesting that mutations in <italic>FLJ42289</italic> and/or <italic>CERS3</italic> (ceramide synthase 3) could be associated with this unusual form of ARCI. We therefore performed sequence analyses of the affected individuals and functional studies on mutant skin samples and keratinocytes, which were differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this way, we were able to characterize a new type of ichthyosis and to provide evidence for the involvement of <italic>CERS3</italic> mutations in the development of ARCI in humans.</p>

        <p>We performed genome-wide SNP-array based homozygosity mapping in 34 consanguineous families with ARCI including three Tunisian families with a syndromic form of ARCI. The clinical features in the four patients (D1, D2, C, and S) include collodion membrane at birth evolving to generalized ARCI, but also short stature, brachydactyly with joint stiffness, microspherophakia, ectopia lentis, mitral valve defects, and multiple nevi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003536-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g001">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003536.s005">Text S1</xref>). These patients all shared a homozygous region on chromosome 15q26.3 with an identical haplotype in the smallest common interval of 1.67 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Within this region, a homozygous deletion of about 100 Kb was observed between the SNP markers rs1080492 and rs7179355 that encompasses the first three exons of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic>, the complete sequence of the non-coding RNA <italic>FLJ42289</italic>, and exon 13 of <italic>CERS3</italic> including the 3â²UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We confirmed the homozygous deletion in these patients using FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and array CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) analysis (data not shown). A breakpoint spanning PCR followed by sequencing defined the genomic deletion encompassing 106,960 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003536.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, sequencing of all exons and exon/intron boundaries of the <italic>CERS3</italic> gene showed the absence of PCR amplification of exon 13 and therefore confirmed the genomic deletion in the patients (D1, D2, C, and S). <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> was not sequenced. One additional Tunisian individual (H) with isolated ARCI also showed a homozygous region on 15q26.3, but did not carry the genomic deletion described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, sequencing of the <italic>CERS3</italic> gene in this patient revealed a homozygous transversion of guanine to thymine affecting the exon 9 splice donor site (c.609+1G&gt;T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). To analyze the functional effect of this mutation event we performed reverse transcription of mRNA from patient H isolated from <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated keratinocytes followed by PCR amplification of the corresponding <italic>CERS3</italic> region using specific primers. Separation by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as sequencing of the PCR fragment demonstrated a reduced length of the PCR product due to skipping of exon 9 resulting in an in-frame deletion of 93 bp in the <italic>CERS3</italic> coding transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003536.s002">Figure S2</xref>). MutationTaster software calculated a result score of 0.999 for a probable disease causing mutation event <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, this sequence variation was not found in 96 unaffected population-matched control individuals.</p>

<italic>CERS3</italic> mutations cause abnormal skin morphology</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of <italic>CERS3</italic> mutations in the development of ichthyosis we performed histological and biochemical studies using a skin sample of patient H carrying the splice site mutation in the <italic>CERS3</italic> gene. Since we could not exclude that mutations in <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> and/or <italic>FLJ42289</italic> interfere with skin physiology, we did not include samples from the patients with the gene deletion syndrome in the following experiments. Histological analysis of the skin biopsy from patient H showed acanthosis with thickening of the stratum granulosum, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and normal size of the detached stratum corneum (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To examine CERS3 distribution in skin we performed immunofluorescence staining of paraffin as well as frozen sections from human control biopsies. Using an antibody targeting an epitope near the N-terminus of CERS3 (amino acid 59â120) we demonstrated that the protein localizes at the interface between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003536.s003">Figure S3</xref>) in accordance with data of the <italic>Human Protein Atlas</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>). In contrast, the patient's skin biopsy did not show CERS3 staining suggesting that functional protein is not present in mutant epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We verified these results by immunoblotting of lysates from <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated control and patient keratinocytes using an antibody targeting amino acids 370â383 at the C-terminus of CERS3. Immunoblots revealed expression of the protein in control cells at the basal stage (day 0) and increased levels during progression of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Concordant with the results of immunofluorescence staining, we did not detect full-length CERS3 or a truncated version of the protein in mutant keratinocytes under basal conditions as well as at later stages of keratinocyte differentiation.</p>

        <title>Mutations in <italic>CERS3</italic> lead to an abnormal terminal differentiation</title>
        <p>To examine the effect of <italic>CERS3</italic> mutations on epidermal differentiation, we performed immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis using established differentiation markers for keratinocytes. In healthy control skin, immunohistochemical staining showed that K14, a marker of undifferentiated keratinocytes, was almost exclusively present in the stratum basale arranged as a one- or two-cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, upper panel). In a skin sample of patient H, however, K14 staining expanded to upper cell layers. During differentiation, keratinocytes from the basal layer gradually migrate upwards forming the upper layers of the epidermis. Thus, an expansion of the basal layer in mutant skin could be a result of an increased proliferation and/or delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. However, immunolabeling of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in control and patient skin corresponded to the K14 expression pattern, indicating a delayed epidermal differentiation and an increased number of proliferating cells in mutant skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lower panel). Immunofluorescence staining for involucrin, loricrin, and filaggrin, markers for terminally differentiated keratinocytes, revealed a thickening of the upper stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum in patient skin compared to control samples. Together, these observations suggest that mutated CERS3 affects the terminal differentiation process in human skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report four patients with a genomic microdeletion on chromosome 15q26.3 that partially affects the sequences of <italic>CERS3</italic> and <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> and abolishes the sequence of the non-coding RNA <italic>FLJ42289</italic>. We observed the same haplotype with an identical genomic deletion in these patients and since they originate from the same geographical region in Tunisia, we concluded that the present contiguous gene deletion syndrome is due to a founder effect. The loss of exon 13 in <italic>CERS3</italic> with the 3â²UTR and the first three exons of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> including the 5â²UTR and the start codon predict a reduced mRNA transcript stability of both genes that renders protein translation unlikely. Moreover, the genomic deletion could lead to a fusion protein of CERS3 with ADAMTS17 resulting in a stop codon in exon 4 of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic>. If so, the premature termination codon in the predicted fusion gene suggests an enhanced transcript instability triggered by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Exon 13 of <italic>CERS3</italic> corresponds to the C-terminal amino acids 334â383 that are predicted to form a coiled-coil structure (amino acids 335â355, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>). This domain is found in many other proteins involved in important biological functions such as gene regulation (e.g. transcription factors) or vesicular transport <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Gillingham1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Moreover, because of their specific interaction, coiled-coil structures are essential for protein-protein interactions thereby facilitating dimerization (e.g. leucine zipper) <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Harbury1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mahrenholz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Whether CERS3 interacts with DNA or with other proteins via its coiled-coil motif is not known so far. However, the C-terminal 50 amino acids of CERS3 are evolutionary highly conserved among mammals (homology 62â96%) indicating an important role of this domain for protein function.</p>
      <p>Since the partial deletion of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> and <italic>CERS3</italic> seems to have a pathologic effect only when both alleles are affected, and since the parents of our patients have no obvious disease symptoms, we conclude an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Thus, the present contiguous gene deletion syndrome leads to two independent diseases (ARCI and WM-like syndrome). Currently, it is unclear whether the deletion of the non-coding RNA <italic>FLJ42289</italic> contributes to the phenotype of the syndrome.</p>
      <p>Recently, Morales <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Morales1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> described a related WM-like syndrome phenotype in eight individuals from Saudi Arabian families with mutations in <italic>ADAMTS17</italic>, who displayed many of the key features of WM-like syndrome, including lenticular myopia, ectopia lentis, glaucoma, spherophakia, and short stature, but none of these patients had the characteristic brachydactyly or decreased joint flexibility of WM-like syndrome. However, in our four patients with the homozygous 15q26.3 microdeletion in which the first three exons of <italic>ADAMTS17</italic> are missing, three of them show a brachydactyly and two of them have reduced joint flexibility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003536-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g001">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003536.s005">Text S1</xref>). This observation is coherent with phenotypic variability found in most genetic syndromes and underlines the importance of clinical reports in rare genetic disorders.</p>
      <p>The identification of the <italic>CERS3</italic> splice donor site mutation, c.609+1G&gt;T, in an additional patient (H) with isolated ARCI confirmed that mutations in <italic>CERS3</italic> are causative for the skin anomalies in this form of contiguous gene deletion syndrome. The splice site mutation leads to the loss of exon 9 in the <italic>CERS3</italic> coding transcript. This sequence region corresponds to a transmembrane domain (amino acid 174â194) of CERS3 that is thought to be essential for proper membrane topology of the protein. Thus, the loss of this structure would most likely affect protein localization as well as stability. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody that recognizes an N-terminal epitope of CERS3 demonstrated the presence of the protein at the interface between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum in control skin but was not detectable in the patient H. CERS3 belongs to a family of enzymes encoded by the <italic>CERS</italic> genes (<italic>CERS1</italic>â6 in mammals) that were originally referred to as <italic>LASS 1â6</italic> (<underline>l</underline>ongevity <underline>ass</underline>urance homolog 1â6) based on their homology to the yeast protein, longevity assurance 1 (LAG1p) <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Venkataraman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Riebeling1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. All mammalian CERS are integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyze the acylation of the free amine nitrogen of the sphingoid long chain base to form an amide bond (<italic>N</italic>-acylation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Stiban1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this reaction each CERS prefers acyl-CoAs of specific carbon chain length to synthesize ceramides <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mizutani1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Jennemann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Venkataraman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Riebeling1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mizutani2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Lahiri1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Of the six known mammalian CERS, CERS3 shows the broadest substrate spectrum utilizing acyl-CoAs of 18 to 28 carbon chain lengths <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mizutani1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Jennemann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that <italic>CERS3</italic> mRNA is mainly expressed in testis and epidermis, and its expression in these tissues strongly increases upon differentiation <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Rabionet1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mizutani3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, CERS3 contributes to the fatty acid composition and concentration of ceramides in these tissues. In skin sections of the patient carrying the splice site donor mutation we did not detect ceramides in the epidermis by immunohistochemistry using a commercially available antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the patients' ichthyosis skin phenotype results from mutations in <italic>CERS3</italic> that significantly impair the epidermal ceramide synthesis, in particular the synthesis of (glucosyl)acylceramides. Using TLC analysis, however, we identified VLC ceramides in <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated patient keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003536-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) suggesting that the mutated CERS3 may harbor residual enzymatic activity. In addition, some limited synthesis of VLC ceramides may occur in patient keratinocytes by the enzymatic activity of other members of the CERS family that compensate for the CERS3 defect. Indeed, CERS2 as well as CERS4 show epidermal expression and substrate specificities toward acyl-CoAs with acyl chain lengths of 22 to 26 carbon atoms <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Jennemann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mizutani4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In mammalian epidermis, ceramides represent the most abundant components of the stratum corneum lipid, which forms a barrier against the penetration of chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms as well as the unregulated loss of water <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Feingold1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. There are at least eleven different ceramide species in human skin, differing in their fatty acid composition as well as their sphingoid base <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Mizutani4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To date, the molecular details of sphingolipid metabolism resulting in this huge structural diversity of epidermal ceramides as well as their role in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes have not been extensively studied. However, profound knowledge of these pathways and their regulation is of great interest for the understanding of skin physiology and to provide novel targets and strategies for the treatment of ichthyosis and possibly other lipid-associated disorders of the skin. In this context, the metabolism of (glucosyl)acylceramides may play a central role in epidermal lipid pathways <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Acylceramides are epidermis-specific sphingolipids carrying amide-linked VLC fatty acids with a terminal hydroxyl group that is further esterified with linoleic acid. In mammalian skin, these ceramides are an absolute prerequisite for the formation of an intact stratum corneum and the water permeability barrier <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Accordingly, loss-of-function of enzymes involved in acylceramide metabolism result in cutaneous barrier abnormalities such as those found in human diseases and corresponding mouse models like ELOVL4-deficiency (MIM 614457) <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Aldahmesh1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003536-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> or Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (MIM 275630) <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Uchida2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Radner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The skin of these patients and mutant mice does not exhibit detectable levels of acylceramides and displays a delayed terminal differentiation process that is similar to the one observed in CERS3-deficient skin, arguing for a fundamental role of acylceramides in keratinization. The importance of ceramides and their metabolism for cellular proliferation and differentiation is also evident in other organs and cell types. Very recently, Jennemann <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003536-Jennemann2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> demonstrated that glucosylceramides are essential for intestinal epithelial differentiation to maintain the reabsorption function of enterocytes.</p>
      <p>Our data resemble in many ways the skin phenotype of mice with targeted disruption of the <italic>Cers3</italic> gene <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Jennemann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast to affected patients of our families, however, <italic>Cers3</italic>-null mice die shortly after birth due to drastically reduced levels of VLC ceramides leading to a dysfunctional water permeability barrier and rapid dehydration of the animals <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Jennemann1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This interesting phenotypic difference suggests that mice are more sensitive to barrier defects than humans probably due to a disadvantageous ratio of body volume to skin surface provoking increased dehydration. Notably, similar skin barrier defects associated with early postnatal death are also present in other mouse models for human skin disorders like Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Radner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> or NISCH syndrome (MIM 607626) <xref rid="pgen.1003536-Furuse1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Future detailed studies addressing skin integrity and barrier recovery of patients with <italic>CERS3</italic> mutations will be required to shed light on the mechanisms involved in disease development in humans.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study reports a contiguous gene deletion syndrome that identifies <italic>CERS3</italic> as another ARCI-associated gene in humans. We present functional evidence demonstrating that CERS3 is crucial for the synthesis of VLC ceramides in human skin to maintain epidermal lipid homeostasis and terminal differentiation. Therefore, we suggest that the application of lotions supplemented with VLC ceramides, especially acylceramides onto the skin of affected patients would be a promising therapeutic approach to treat skin symptoms in patients with keratinization disorders.</p>
