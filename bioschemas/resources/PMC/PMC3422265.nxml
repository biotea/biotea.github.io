        <p>Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8; ANTXR1) is one of two anthrax toxin receptors; the other is capillary morphogenesis gene 2 protein (CMG2; ANTXR2). TEM8 shows enhanced expression in certain tumor endothelia, and is thought to be a player in tumor vasculature formation. However, a comprehensive expression profile of individual TEM8 variants in normal or cancerous tissues is lacking. In this work we carried out an extensive analysis of all splice variants of human TEM8 in 12 digestive tissues, and 8 each fetal and adult tissues, 6 of them cognate pairs. Using variant-specific primers, we first ascertained the status of full-length transcripts by nested PCR. We then carried out quantitative analysis of each transcript by real-time PCR. Three splice variants of TEM8 were reported before, two single-pass integral membrane forms (V1 and V2) and one secreted (V3). Our analysis has revealed two new variants, one encoding a membrane-bound form of the receptor and the other secreted, which we have designated V4 and V5, respectively. All tissues had V1, V2, V3, and V4, but only prostate had V5. Real-time PCR revealed that all variants are present at different levels in various tissues. V3 appeared the most abundant of all. To ascertain its functionality for anthrax toxin, we expressed the newly identified form V4 in a receptor-negative host cell, and included V1 and V2 for comparison. Cytotoxicity, toxin binding, and internalization assays showed V4 to be as efficient a receptor as V1 and V2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) was originally discovered by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in endothelial cells of colon carcinomas <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The analysis revealed markedly elevated levels of TEM8 mRNA in these cells, and normal endothelial cells appeared to have little of it. Further, these studies identified three splice variants of the gene, V1, V2, and V3. The variants encode proteins of 564, 368, and 333 residues, respectively. Topologically, V1 and V2 are type-1 integral membrane proteins with a single tramsmembrane helix. V2 is identical to V1 up to residue 364, but the last four residues of V2 are unique, a consequence of differential splicing. V3 sequence diverges from V1 and V2 right before the beginning of the transmembrane helix. Thus, V3 has a portion that is identical to the extracellular portions of V1 and V2, but its 13-residue carboxyl terminal segment is unique.</p>
      <p>Using a human cDNA library for expression cloning, Bradley et al. <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> independently identified TEM8 V2 as an anthrax toxin receptor. Later studies showed that V1 also functions as an anthrax toxin receptor, and that V3 does not <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus, these findings were consistent with the original reports that V1 and V2 are integral membrane proteins and V3 is a secreted form <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, TEM8 is not the only cell surface protein that anthrax toxin uses to enter cells. Capillary morphogenesis gene 2 protein (CMG2), a protein similar to TEM8, was found to be an avid receptor as well <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Indeed CMG2 proved a stronger anthrax toxin receptor than TEM8 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. CMG2, like TEM8, has multiple splice variants. At least two membrane-bound forms of it, the 488-residue and 489-residue proteins, both strongly support anthrax toxin entry <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. CMG2 was originally identified by way of its enhanced expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and evidence suggests it is a player in angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The only definitively known function of TEM8 is its role as an anthrax toxin receptor, and commensurate with that function it is designated ANTXR1. Likewise, the confirmed role of CMG2 is that of anthrax toxin receptor, and therefore it is designated ANTXR2. Each protein has a von Willebrand Factor A (vWA) domain in its extracellular portion, and within this domain each protein also has a metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Both features are important for anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) binding <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Anthrax toxin is secreted by <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, a Gram-positive, encapsulated, spore-forming rod <xref rid="pone.0043174-Leppla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The toxin comprises three proteins: protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF). None of the proteins alone is toxic to cells; the toxic assemblies are PA+EF and PA+LF <xref rid="pone.0043174-Leppla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. EF is a calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase that harms cells by producing excessive amounts of cAMP <xref rid="pone.0043174-Leppla2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. LF is a Zn-dependent metalloprotease that targets MAP kinase kinases in cytosol; LF can cleave six out of seven of these kinases <xref rid="pone.0043174-Duesbery1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Klimpel1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Pellizzari1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Vitale1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Vitale2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This cleavage is detrimental to cells, and its consequences include apoptosis in at least human endothelial cells and the mouse macrophage line RAW264.7 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Kirby1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Popov1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, as well as in human melanoma cells <xref rid="pone.0043174-Koo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. PA itself has no toxic activity, but is crucial because it delivers EF and LF inside cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process that requires functioning ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Leppla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Upon binding the receptors PA is cleaved by furin, releasing a 23-kDa amino-terminal fragment <xref rid="pone.0043174-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Klimpel2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The 63-kDa PA remains bound and forms a heptamer, which then binds three molecules of EF, LF, or both <xref rid="pone.0043174-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Mogridge1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Mogridge2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The receptor-toxin complex is then internalized. Upon exposure to acidic pH in an endosome the heptamer changes its conformation, subsequently translocating EF and LF into cytosol <xref rid="pone.0043174-Leppla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Acidification of the endocytic pathway is indispensable for the intoxication process <xref rid="pone.0043174-Friedlander1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The natural ligands for TEM8 and CMG2 have not been precisely identified. It is known, however, that TEM8 interacts with cleaved C5 domain of collagen Î±3 (VI) <xref rid="pone.0043174-Nanda1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, while CMG2 can interact with collagen IV and laminin <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. But the functional significance of these interactions remains obscure. The suggested native role for the two proteins is in neo-angiogenesis, a complex process crucial not only for normal development, but also for many pathological states, such as tumor development and wound healing <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Rmali1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Rmali2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Notably, TEM8 shows enhanced expression in endothelia of certain colon carcinomas, suggesting its role in tumor vasculature formation <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-CarsonWalter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. TEM8 expression has also been studied in some phagocytes <xref rid="pone.0043174-Premanandan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have carried out extensive variant-specific expression analysis of human TEM8 by nested as well as real-time PCR. We report here that TEM8 transcripts show ubiquitous expression, albeit at different levels. We also report identification of two new transcripts, one of which encodes a fully functional anthrax toxin receptor.</p>

        <p>Human prostate and fetal brain Smart RACE Marathon Ready cDNAs, human multiple tissue cDNA panels, and plasmid pIREShyg3 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The template in Marathon Ready cDNAs is double-stranded, but that in the tissue panels is first strand synthesized (reverse transcribed) RNA-DNA hybrid. The reagents for PCR (polymerases, dNTPs, and buffers) were from Clontech, Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and Takara (Japan). Primers were made by the FDA Core Facility (Bethesda, Maryland), Sigma-Genosys (Houston, Texas), or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Restriction enzymes and the ligation kit were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Supercompetent XL1-Blue cells were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Functionally receptor-negative cell line PR230 and its parental line, WTB111, have been reported before <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>

        <p>For TEM8 V1, the primers were based on the reported longest original transcript (NCBI accession number, NM_032208; 5540 bp; coding sequence, 144â1836; 564 aa). For nested PCR, the primary and secondary (nested) PCR primers were designed to partially overlap (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043174-t001">Table 1</xref>). The primers s21 and as 1842 amplify an 1848-bp V1 fragment containing the coding sequence. For analysis of V2 and V3, the sense primers were the same as for V1, but the antisense primers were specific, each representing the unique 3â² region of V2 (NCBI accession number, NM_053034; 1454 bp; coding sequence, 144â1247; 368 aa), or V3 (NCBI accession number, NM_018153; 2143 bp; coding sequence, 144â1142; 333 aa). All primers were assessed for any secondary structures and self-complementarity using the Oligonucleotide Calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html">http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Purification of PCR Products</title>
        <p>Based on results from analytical gels, those mixtures that had unique bands were purified directly using a PCR product purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Those mixtures that had two or more PCR bands were subjected to preparative gel electrophoresis. Long-tooth combs were used to make preparative gels. Sample over-loadings were avoided to retain electrophoretic resolution of DNA fragments that had physical proximity. The bands of interest were then cut out of gels and the amplified DNA fragments purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The final elution volume depended on the amount of products, as judged from the analytical gels, and varied from 30 to 100 ÂµL. The purified DNA fragments were analyzed on gels to assess the degree of purity and recovery. When purity was insufficient or recovery low, the PCR reactions were carried out again, sometimes in duplicate or triplicate, to obtain sufficient amounts for purification.</p>

        <title>Identification of a New Membrane-bound Variant of ANTXR1 (TEM8)</title>
        <p>The reported original TEM8 (ANXR1) splice variants encode proteins of 564, 368, and 333 residues, respectively designated V1, V2, and V3 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Scobie2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. V1 and V2 are single-pass integral membrane proteins and V3 secreted. Both V1 and V2 function as anthrax toxin receptors, while V3 does not <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. TEM8 was originally discovered as one of nine tumor endothelial markers that showed enhanced expression in colon tumor endothelia <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Later findings showed that TEM8 mRNA also shows elevated expression in certain other tumor endothelia <xref rid="pone.0043174-CarsonWalter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, a detailed expression analysis of each of the three transcripts has been lacking. For this work we analyzed the expression of each variant in a large number of human tissues using commercially available cDNA panels. Using variant-specific primers, we analyzed the presence of full-length TEM8 transcripts, which required nested PCR.</p>
        <p>For V1 transcript analysis, the primary PCR primers were s3+as1859 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043174-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We have based all primer and other numbering on the original 5540-nucleotide transcript for V1 (accession number, NM_032208; ORF, nucleotides 144-1835), originally reported when the gene was first discovered <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Initially we ran a pilot analysis using human fetal brain and prostate Marathon Ready cDNA. But PCR with these primers resulted in no amplification. We think this was partly because of low concentration of template cDNA, but could not rule out the possibility that the V1 transcript may be a rare one. We therefore opted to do nested PCR with primers s21+as1842 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043174-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This resulted in definite amplification of a unique fragment from the fetal brain cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The unique amplicon from fetal brain appeared smaller than the expected 1848-bp fragment (nucleotides 21â1868). Indeed sequencing revealed this fragment to be 1740 bp, 108 bp shorter than the expected V1 amplicon. We designated it TEM8 variant 4 (V4).</p>

        <p>We analyzed the V4 sequence by BLAST, BLAST-2, and BLAT to precisely determine its splicing boundaries. This analysis revealed that differential splicing of V4 relative to the reported V1 transcript is within exon 18, the last one. The intron 17/exon 18 boundary is the same for V1 and V4. Apparently V4 differential splicing comes about by recruiting new splice donor and acceptor sites within exon 18, resulting in exclusion of the 108-bp segment from the coding sequence of V1. This alternative splicing retains the V1 reading frame, and therefore V4 differs from V1 only in that it has an internal 36-residue in-frame deletion spanning residues 522â557 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g002">Figure 2A, B &amp; C</xref>). Thus, V4 is a new 528-residue membrane bound form of TEM8/ANTXR1 (GenBank, JX424838).</p>

        <title>Identification of TEM8 V5, a New Secreted Variant</title>
        <p>As already stated, nested PCR analysis of pooled prostate cDNA with the primer sets s3+as1859 and s21+as1842 resulted in multiple amplicons, one of them identical to the 1740-bp fetal brain fragment. However, prostate had a unique smaller amplicon of about 1300 bp. Sequencing revealed this amplicon to be 1361-bp long. Analysis of this sequence by BLAST, BLAST-2, and BLAT revealed that the amplicon represents a new splice form of TEM8, with the same start codon as the other variants. However, differential splicing of this variant comes about by recruiting an alternative splice donor site within exon 12, ten nucleotides upstream of the one for V1. This site then splices with a new acceptor site within exon 18, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. The overall consequence of this is that exons 13â17 are altogether skipped and the reading frame is shifted. The ORF in this sequence is 358 residues, which diverges from the other forms after residue 314, right before the transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We have designated this TEM8 splice variant V5 (GenBank, JX424839). Like V3, V5 does not have the tramsmembrane helix that V1, V2, and V4 do. It also does not have any other predicted transmembrane helix. We therefore conclude that V5 is a secreted form of TEM8. The divergent carboxyl-terminal segments of V3 and V5 are unique, but otherwise they are identical to the membrane-bound TEM8 proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g002">Figure 2C</xref> schematically shows the relative topological positioning of the three previously reported variants of TEM8, as well as the two new ones reported in this work.</p>
        <p>Prostate also had an amplicon slightly below the 1740-bp one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). But we have not established its identity; repeated attempts at isolating and sequencing it failed. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that it may be yet another variant of TEM8.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Full-length TEM8 V1, V4, and V5 by Nested PCR</title>
        <p>Nested PCR results with human fetal brain and prostate revealed a highly differential profile of TEM8 expression in these two developmentally and histologically distinct tissues. To ascertain a more precise expression profile of each TEM8 transcript, we analyzed a large number of normal human tissues. To do that we used one normalized cDNA set representing 12 digestive system tissues. A second set comprised cDNAs from 8 fetal and 8 adult tissues, 6 of them cognate pairs. For this analysis we used the same V1-specific primers that revealed V4 and V5.</p>
        <p>The most prominent band following nested PCR was confirmed to be V4, not V1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g003">Figure 3</xref>, V4 showed ubiquitous expression in digestive, as well as the fetal and adult tissues tested. Upon primary PCR, there appeared noticeable differences in the variantâs expression levels. However, this was not a quantitative analysis, and therefore we could not rely on the differences in expression by this approach. To more precisely determine the expression levels we did real-time PCR.</p>

        <title>Specific Analysis of Full-length TEM8 V1 Transcript by Nested PCR</title>
        <p>As described above, nested PCR primers specifically meant to amplify the 1848-bp V1 fragment, which carries the complete coding sequence for this variant, failed to do so, except in prostate. Instead they revealed a new ubiquitous transcript that encodes a 528-residue membrane-bound form of the protein, as well as a putative secreted form unique to prostate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g003">3</xref>).

        <p>Nonetheless, we allowed the possibility that unexpected absence of V1 from so many tissues may be an artifactual anomaly, and therefore decided to further assess its apparent absence. To do so, we made sense and antisense primers specific for the 108-bp region unique to V1, but absent from V4 and V5, as well as V2 and V3. We used these primers in conjunction with s3 and s21, as well as other sense and antisense primers to amplify V1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043174-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed these attempts resulted in definite bands of the expected sizes in all tissue cDNA templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Sequencing confirmed that these fragments carried the 108-bp segment unique to V1. We therefore conclude that the absence of V1 upon first analysis was anomalous. However, we are unable to explain why the antisense primers as1859 and as1842, both specific for the reported V1 transcript, in conjunction with s3 and s21 failed to amplify the expected V1 amplicon in any of the 28 tissues represented in the three cDNA panels.</p>

        <p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g008">Figure 8</xref> show that V1 is ubiquitous, consistent with the nested PCR results. However, its levels vary from tissue to tissue, at times markedly. Of the digestive tissues, jejunum had the greatest and colon the least amounts of V1, as suggested by the difference of 5 in their ÎC<sub>t</sub> values. Among the fetal tissues, kidney showed the greatest and thymus and liver the least of V1. Of the adult tissues, skeletal muscle showed much greater expression than brain. There were differences in V1 expression among the cognate pairs of fetal and adult tissues. Fetal brain, for example, had much greater expression of V1 than did adult brain. But there appeared no definitive pattern; some fetal tissues had more of V1 than their cognate adult tissues, and vice versa. Of all 28 tissues analyzed, adult brain had the lowest expression of V1.</p>
        <p>Quantitative analysis results for V2 differed from the nested PCR results in that the qPCR revealed presence of V2 in all tissues, whereas nested PCR did not. V2 showed differences in expression from tissue to tissues, but generally these variations were not as remarkable as for V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

        <title>Analysis of V4 Function as an Anthrax Toxin Receptor</title>
        <p>The extracellular portion of V4 is identical to those of V1 and V2, both functional anthrax toxin receptors. It has also been shown that TEM8 functions as an anthrax toxin receptor even when its intracellular portion is removed <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that V4 would also prove a functional toxin receptor, despite the 36-residue in-frame internal deletion in its cytoplasmic domain. To verify, we tested V4 as an anthrax toxin receptor in parallel with the previously reported forms V1 and V2. V4 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pIREShyg3 as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>. V1 and V2 cloning and expression has been described before <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The plasmid-encoded receptors were expressed in PR230, a functionally receptor-negative Chinese hamster ovary cell line <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g010">Figure 10</xref>, V4 supported anthrax toxin entry as efficiently as V1 and V2, and the toxin IC<sub>50</sub> for PR230 expressing any of the three receptors was nearly the same. The host cell alone was resistant. WTB111, the parent of PR230, was included as a control for toxicity. A modified form of anthrax toxin, PA+FP59, was used for these assays. FP59 is a recombinant toxin that carries the PA-binding amino-terminal domain of LF and the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A <xref rid="pone.0043174-Arora1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

        <title>Assessment of PA Binding, Processing, and Internalization</title>
        <p>The overall efficiency of intoxication depends on a series of sequential events that underlie the toxin endocytosis. The notable ones are PA binding to receptors, cleavage by furin to release a 20-kDa amino-terminal fragment, PA63 heptamer formation on the cell surface, heptamer internalization, and routing to an acidic compartment, where the heptamer undergoes conformational changes <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Friedlander1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It is not inconceivable that various receptor forms could differ in their capacity to support these events, and yet the toxin IC<sub>50</sub> values may be nearly the same. We therefore assessed PA binding, cleavage by furin, and oligomerization in PR230 cells expressing V1, V2, or V4.</p>
        <p>The binding assays were done at 4Â°C and 37Â°C as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>. At 4Â°C membrane trafficking is essentially arrested, and consequently no PA enters cells. But receptor-bound PA83 is still cleaved by furin to form PA63 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The PA63 heptamer that forms on the cell surface resolves into PA63 monomers upon SDS-PAGE. In contrast, at 37Â°C the heptamer enters cells and becomes SDS-resistant upon exposure to acidic pH in endosomes. Thus, appearance of this heptamer on Western blots can serve as an index of toxin entry. This is shown in a control experiment with WTB111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). Little, if any, PA63 oligomers appear when the binding experiment is performed at 4Â°C, but a strong doublet of oligomers appears when the experiment is done at 37Â°C. With these cells we have consistently observed that two bands representing PA oligomers appear. Such doublets have been reported before <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. It is also known that aside from the heptamer, PA63 also forms octamers, and such assemblies involve intermediate stages of dimers and tetramers <xref rid="pone.0043174-Kintzer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, the lower order assemblies do not appear to be SDS-resistant <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-VanderGoot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Mogridge1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Mogridge2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The 4Â°C binding assays revealed that V1, V2, and V4 equally support PA binding and its cleavage by furin, as is clear from the PA83 and PA63 bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g011">Figure 11B</xref>. We next assessed the three receptorsâ capacity to support entry of PA. To do that we incubated cells with PA at 37Â°C, followed by processing as for the 4Â°C assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g011">Figure 11C</xref>, all three receptors bound PA83 equally well at this temperature as well. Further, the subsequent cleavage of PA83 to yield PA63 was also equally efficient for all three receptors. And the SDS-resistant oligomer formation was also efficient for all three receptors. The oligomers reflect successful entry of the toxin. Overall these results are fully consistent with the finding that all three receptors make PR230 cells sensitive to PA+FP59 to the same extent. Thus, when expressed in PR230, V4 as an anthrax toxin receptor is as efficient as V1 and V2.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Discovered as a gene that showed elevated expression in endothelial cells of colon carcinomas, TEM8 was suggested to be a player in tumor vasculature development <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Histological studies that employed <italic>in situ</italic> mRNA hybridization also showed the geneâs enhanced expression in tumor endothelia <xref rid="pone.0043174-CarsonWalter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, the relative expression levels of the three reported TEM8 transcripts remained undetermined. Therefore it was unclear whether all three were elevated in tumor endothelia or only one of them. Indeed at that time it was unclear whether TEM8 is expressed in normal tissues. Moreover, <italic>in situ</italic> mRNA hybridizations are not nearly as sensitive as PCR, and thus often fail to detect transcripts expressed at low levels. Variant-specific expression profile of the gene remained undetermined altogether. Once determined as an anthrax toxin receptor <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, it was clear that the gene shows wide expression, given that the toxin can bind and enter a wide variety of cell types <xref rid="pone.0043174-Leppla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Chaudry1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. It has also been reported that TEM8 shows differential expression in mouse tissues <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bonuccelli1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The major focus of this work was to ascertain an expression profile of all splice variant mRNAs of TEM8 in human tissues. The analysis employed variant-specific primers and nested PCR. To further ensure this analysis is indeed of those TEM8 transcripts that encode the three reported variants, we used primers designed to amplify fragments that carry the complete coding regions. Our findings show that all tissues analyzed have the previously reported variants, V1, V2, and V3. Although nested PCR showed selective expression of V2, the real-time PCR showed that the variant is indeed expressed in all tissues analyzed. We therefore conclude that V2 is not selectively expressed, and its absence in some cases was due to failure of nested PCR.</p>
      <p>Analysis of V1 transcript initially proved problematic; two separate sets of primers specific for the reported V1 sequence failed to amplify it. We are unable to explain this anomaly, but the same primers amplified two novel splice variants of TEM8. One of these, V4, encodes a 528-residue membrane-bound form of TEM8, and the other, V5, a 358-residue protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g002">2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g003">3</xref>). The V5 protein sequence diverges after residue 314, and it does not have the TEM8 hydrophobic transmembrane helix, nor any other predicted one. We therefore conclude that the putative V5 protein is a secreted form of TEM8. Prostate cDNA pools analyzed were the only ones that had V5; neither nested PCR, nor real-time PCR amplified the target fragments of V5 from any of the other 28 tissues analyzed. We therefore conclude that V5 is likely an exceedingly rare splice form of TEM8.</p>
      <p>The newly discovered variant V4 shows broad expression, as evidenced by both nested and real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g003">Figures 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g009">9</xref>). The V4 sequence differs from V1 in that it lacks a 108 bp cDNA segment, resulting in an in-frame deletion of 36-residues (residues 522â557) in the cytoplasmic domain. We therefore exploited this difference to analyze V1 transcript using primers specific for the 108-bp V1 segment. This approach worked; separate sets of sense and antisense primers specific for this region gave the expected amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g004">Figures 4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g008">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>V1 and V2 are proven anthrax toxin receptors <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bradley2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We have shown that V4 too is a functional anthrax toxin receptor. The receptor confers the same degree of sensitivity on PR230 as V1 and V2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g010">Figure 10</xref>). PR230 is a functionally receptor-negative cell line that has been described before <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Consistent with these results, anthrax toxin protective antigen efficiently binds V4, is cleaved by furin, is internalized, and forms the SDS-resistant oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043174-g011">Figure 11B, C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that TEM8 expression is not restricted to any particular type of tissue. However, whether the normal and tumor endothelial cells show different expression patterns for all five variants remains to be seen. Another point to note is that we used pooled tissue cDNA panels representing different individuals. Thus, it is impossible to tell whether the gene exhibits individual-specific variations. As an example, we found V5 in one pooled prostate cDNA panel, but not in another (not shown). This suggests the possibility that the geneâs expression profile may even vary from individual to individual. A statistically significant number of individual samples would be required to discern such differences, if any.</p>
      <p>An intriguing expression pattern of TEM8 in neuroblastoma cell lines has been reported. In these cells the gene is found as fusion transcripts with various segments of novel neuroblastoma gene 1 (NNG1) <xref rid="pone.0043174-DePreter1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Oberthuer1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Oberthuer et al. identified 4 such transcripts, each representing the first 14 exons of TEM8 and various segments of NNG1. Revealed by sequencing, the transcripts encode fusion proteins of 388, 411, 412, and 420 residues, all comprising the first 363 residues of TEM8. However, the functional significance, if any, of these fusion transcripts is unclear.</p>
      <p>The putative role of ANTXR1/TEM8 in neo-angiogenesis remains dubious. But in mice the gene is dispensable, as evidenced by normal development of TEM8<sup>â/â</sup> knockout mice <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Indeed, the other anthrax toxin receptor, ANTXR2/CMG2, is also dispensable for mouse development, as shown by studies with CMG2<sup>â/â</sup> mice <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Note that CMG2 has also been reported a player in angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0043174-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Reeves1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, these findings do not necessarily rule out angiogenic role for TEM8 and CMG2 during mouse development. If the two genes are indeed players during mouse developmental angiogenesis, then there exist other players that compensate for the loss of TEM8 and CMG2. In as much as ANTXR1/TEM8 shows enhanced expression in at least some tumor endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0043174-StCroix1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-CarsonWalter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, the gene does appear to be a player in tumor vasculature development. Evidence also suggests that TEM8 promotes endothelial cell adhesion and migration, which it seems to achieve by interacting with cell matrix proteins <xref rid="pone.0043174-Hotchkiss1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many recent findings have significantly unraveled the endocytic pathway of TEM8 and the proteinâs interactions with other factors. Wei et al. discovered that LRP6, a single-pass integral membrane protein related to the LDL receptor, interacts with TEM8, as well as the other PA receptor, CMG2 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Anthrax toxin endocytosis is largely via the clathrin-mediated pathway, evidently for both TEM8 and CMG2 <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Both receptors cluster in lipid rafts, and TEM8 is palmitoylated and ubiquitinated, modifications that evidently trigger its endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. TEM8 V1 interacts with actin, and this interaction affords more PA binding to this form of ANTXR1/TEM8, although it does not necessarily afford greater sensitivity of cells to anthrax toxin <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043174-Go1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Some other classical players in endocytosis, such as Cbl and Î²-arrestins 1 &amp; 2, are also important for PA heptamer formation. In contrast, Grb2 and Dab2 appear unimportant <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Surprisingly, AP2, the predominant adaptor for clathrin-mediated vesicle budding at the plasma membrane, seems less relevant to PA entry than AP1, which largely functions in vesicle budding from endosomes and trans-Golgi network <xref rid="pone.0043174-Abrami2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
      <p>At the molecular and cellular level, the native functions of ANTXR1/TEM8 remain obscure. The relative roles of the receptorâs various isoforms are even more elusive. Is it possible, for example, that relative enhancement or attenuation of TEM8 variants defines the geneâs role in tumor angiogenesis. Is the gene important in vasculature formation during other disease states, such as wound healing and other forms of tissue repair? Liu et al. have shown that TEM8 and CMG2 are not needed for mouse developmental angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0043174-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, whether these findings can be extended to human development is unknown. They further reported that CMG2 is the major anthrax toxin receptor and that toxin binding to it is 10 times stronger than to TEM8. Evidence also suggests that TEM8 exists in different forms on the cell surface, and that these forms are influenced by actin and the actin binding protein transgelin <xref rid="pone.0043174-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Clearly much more research is needed to precisely elucidate the role of TEM8 and CMG2 at the molecular level in disease state and normal vasculature formation.</p>
