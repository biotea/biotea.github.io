      <abstract id="abs0010">
        <p>The exosome is a conserved multi-protein complex that is essential for correct RNA processing. Recessive variants in exosome components <italic>EXOSC3</italic>, <italic>EXOSC8</italic>, and <italic>RBM7</italic> cause various constellations of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and central nervous system demyelination. Here, we report on four unrelated affected individuals with recessive variants in <italic>EXOSC9</italic> and the effect of the variants on the function of the RNA exosome <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> in affected individualsâ fibroblasts and skeletal muscle and <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> in zebrafish. The clinical presentation was severe, early-onset, progressive SMA-like motor neuronopathy, cerebellar atrophy, and in one affected individual, congenital fractures of the long bones. Three affected individuals of different ethnicity carried the homozygous c.41T&gt;C (p.Leu14Pro) variant, whereas one affected individual was compound heterozygous for c.41T&gt;C (p.Leu14Pro) and c.481C&gt;T (p.Arg161<sup>â</sup>). We detected reduced EXOSC9 in fibroblasts and skeletal muscle and observed a reduction of the whole multi-subunit exosome complex on blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA sequencing of fibroblasts and skeletal muscle detected significant &gt;2-fold changes in genes involved in neuronal development and cerebellar and motor neuron degeneration, demonstrating the widespread effect of the variants. Morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of <italic>exosc9</italic> in zebrafish recapitulated aspects of the human phenotype, as they have in other zebrafish models of exosomal disease. Specifically, portions of the cerebellum and hindbrain were absent, and motor neurons failed to develop and migrate properly. In summary, we show that variants in <italic>EXOSC9</italic> result in a neurological syndrome combining cerebellar atrophy and spinal motoneuronopathy, thus expanding the list of human exosomopathies.</p>

      <p id="p0010">The RNA exosome is a multi-protein complex that plays a vital role in gene expression via processing and degradation of mRNA.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The exosome is composed of nine subunits (EXOSC1âEXOSC9) forming a two-layered ring and is conserved in all eukaryotes.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> EXOSC4âEXOSC9 form the core, a hexamer channel through which the RNA passes, and EXOSC1âEXOSC3 make up the cap of the exosomal ring for RNA recognition and binding.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The exosome in the nucleus processes precursor RNA and degrades precursor species, cryptic transcripts, and un-spliced RNAs,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> whereas in the cytoplasm, the exosome degradesÂ defective transcripts that have evaded nuclear degradation and AU-rich element-containing mRNAs (AREs).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Exosomal RNA degradation proceeds in the 3â²-to-5â² direction and is associated with other proteins, such as EXOSC10, for catalytic activity and the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, which binds and delivers some specific non-coding RNAs to the exosome for degradation.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>

<italic>EXOSC3</italic> variants account for about 40% of PCH1 cases worldwide,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> suggesting further genetic heterogeneity. On the other hand, <italic>EXOSC8</italic> variants seem to be much less frequent, given that despite screening of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> variants in large PCH1 cohorts, only one report on two <italic>EXOSC8</italic> variants has been published to date,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> leaving over 50% of PCH1 cases still unsolved.

        <p id="p0025">Four unrelated affected individuals were included in this study.

        <p id="p0030">Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed in affected individual 1:II-1 with both copy-number and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes on a whole-genome array (Affymetrix CytoScan HD platform). Exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from blood (affected individual 1:II-1) and saliva (affected individual 1:II-1 parents). Trio exome sequencing was performed through the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center with the Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Exome+UTR Library and Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing instruments. Variants were analyzed with Varsifter and searched for in dbSNP, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Variant Server, and the Exome AggregationÂ Consortium (ExAC) Browser.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in affected individual 1:II-1 and her parents.</p>

All relevant variants were inspected visually with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), and their segregation was verified by Sanger sequencing with gene-specific oligonucleotide primers and the BigDye (Applied Biosystems) protocol on an ABI3500 Genetic Analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientific). For verification of the <italic>EXOSC9</italic> c.41T&gt;C (p.Leu14Pro) and the c.481C&gt;T (p.Arg161<sup>â</sup>) variants (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-n:NG_029848.1" id="intref0025">NG_029848.1</ext-link>) we analyzed the PCR-products generated with the oligonucleotide primer pairs 5â²-gcccaagccatttcccattt-3â² (forward) and 5â²-tcagtccacaccttgagacc-3â² (reverse) and 5â²-cctgataaatagccactggttgt-3â² (forward) and 5â²-tcctggttcacataggagct-3â² (reverse).</p>
        <p id="p0040">Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in affected individual 3:II-1 with an Agilent SureSelect All Exons V5 (50 Mb) capture kit (Agilent Technologies) for library preparation. An Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) was used for paired-end 100Â bp sequencing. Sequence alignment, indexing of the reference genome (hg19), variant calling, and annotation used a pipeline based on BWA, SAMtools, GATK (see <xref rid="app4" ref-type="sec">Web Resources</xref>), and ANNOVAR. Variants were annotated with a combination of public knowledge databases available from the ANNOVAR package and in-house databases, which included collections of previously published Saudi disease-causing variants. Variants were interpreted with a previously described in-house variant interpretation pipeline.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in affected individual 3:II-1 and her parents.</p>
        <p id="p0045">Lastly, with genomic DNA from affected individual 4:II-1, the exonic regions and flanking splice junctions of the genome wereÂ captured with the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0. Massively parallel (NextGen) sequencing was done on an Illumina system with 100Â bp or greater paired-end reads. Reads were aligned to human genome build hg19 (UCSC Genome Browser) and analyzed for sequence variants with a custom-developed analysis tool.

        <p id="p0050">Haplotype analysis was determined by the identification of shared regions of homozygous variants from each of the affected individuals with the homozygous <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variant at chr4: 122,722,620. Only variants that were called as high confidence by their respective pipelines were included for analysis, and regardless of pipeline, only non-indel SNVs with at least 10Ã coverage were considered. Specifically, the largest extent of the shared runs of homozygosity (ROH) haplotype was determined by extending the ROHs from the variant in each direction until the first high-confidence heterozygote. The region was then trimmed back from those outer boundaries to the first high-confidence shared homozygote. We then intersected the three resulting regions to determine the shared haplotype. To further assess possible shared ancestry, we performed principal-component analysis (PCA) and k-nearest neighbor (knn) classification on exome SNPs from the four individuals against random representative samples from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 super-populations plus a GeneDx-sequenced Middle Eastern population as previously described by Lake etÂ al<italic>.</italic><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>

Pregnancy was notable for reduced fetal movements. She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 2.98Â kg (10<sup>th</sup>â25<sup>th</sup> percentile), and length was 48Â cm (25<sup>th</sup> percentile). There were no concerns regarding feeding or breathing in the neonatal period, and movements of the extremities were reported as normal. As an infant, she was noted to have poor head control and a soft cry. She was found to have congenital esotropia, which was managed with botulinum toxin A injection. By 8Â months of age, she had increasing difficulty with lifting her arms and legs against gravity. Her strength declined further, which was exacerbated by periods of illness. By 9Â months of age, she had lost the ability to vocalize. She rolled from back to side briefly but subsequently lost this skill. She had normal neonatal growth; however, by 21Â months of age, her weight, height, and head circumference were all below the third percentile. She had a history of recurrent pulmonary infections requiring hospitalizations, and nighttime non-invasive ventilation in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was initiated at 20Â months of age. Examination at the age of 28Â months revealed a high-arched palate and tongue fasciculations. Extraocular movements were full but were notable for broken pursuits and gaze-evoked nystagmus in horizontal and vertical directions. Although there was a tendency for downward deviation of the eyes, upward gaze was also observed. Occasional oromotor dyskinesia was noted on examination. She had severe axial and appendicular hypotonia and profound weakness, causing her to require full head support. She had no antigravity movements proximally in the upper and lower extremities. Wrist extension was antigravity at 3/5 (Medical Research Council-grade), whereas elbow flexion, knee extension, and finger extension were 2/5. Facial strength was relatively spared. Sensation appeared to be normal. Reflexes were absent throughout. Plantar response was flexor bilaterally. There were multiple joint contractures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). Hands were fisted with thumbs adducted, and feet were maintained in a cavo-varus position (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>FigureÂ 1</label><caption><p>Clinical Presentation and Pedigrees</p><p>(A) Clinical photos of affected individual 1:II-1.

Brain MRI performed at the age of 7Â months revealed mild cerebellar atrophy with a normal-appearing pons and no significant abnormalities of the cerebral white matter or the basal ganglia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). A repeat brain MRI at 21Â months of age revealed a mild progression of the cerebellar atrophy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Muscle biopsy performed at 15Â months of age demonstrated abundant, very small fibers, often in groups and intermixed with hypertrophic fibers, consistent with denervation and thus suggestive of a neurogenic process. Lysosomal enzymes, plasma amino acids, carbohydrate transferrin, coenzyme Q10, and plasma lactate levels were normal. No seizures have been observed, and a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) performed at 5Â months of age did not reveal any epileptiform activity. Family history was non-contributory, and the family deniedÂ known consanguinity.

He was born at term with several congenital fractures, including fractures of the bilateral femurs and one fracture of the humerus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Examination findings were consistent with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita with hip and hand involvement, severe hypotonia, and respiratory insufficiency. Dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, prominent epicanthic folds, low-set ears, prominent lips, and a short neck, were noted. Sclerae were described as blueish, and skin appeared redundant. As a result of swallowing difficulties, heÂ required gastric-tube feeding. Brain MRI performed atÂ 1Â week of age showed cerebellar atrophy, generalized cerebral atrophy, and possibly delayed myelination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Muscle biopsy findings, including fiber-type grouping, grouped fiber atrophy, and type 1 fiber hypertrophy, were suggestive of a motor neuronopathy. EMG was not performed. Genetic testing for deletions in <italic>SMN1</italic> and an SMA-related gene panel were negative. Chromosomal microarray analysis, methylation analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome, myotonic dystrophy testing, and metabolic screening were also negative.

She was noted at birth to have hypotonia, a poor cry, and difficulties with feeding. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with microcephaly and failure to thrive, and she was noted to have severe developmental delay. At the age of 5Â months she was noted to have seizures, which were partially controlled by anti-epileptic drugs. Clinical examination at the age of 18Â months showed minor dysmorphicÂ facial features. She was unable to visually track objects. She was not vocalizing and appeared to have receptive language difficulties. There was axial hypotonia,Â generalized weakness of the upper and lower limbs, and an apparent increased tone of the extremities with evidence of exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. SheÂ underwent brain imaging (computed tomography [CT]), which revealed minimal cortical atrophy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). Family history is significant for an older sister who died at the age of 8 years and who reportedly manifested severe spasticity and epilepsy. DNA from the sisterÂ was unavailable for diagnostic testing. Routine biochemistry, renal profile, total creatine phosphokinase, ammonia, plasma amino acids, very-long-chain fatty acids, and urine for organic acids were normal.

She was found to have mild jaundice and congenital nystagmus. At 2Â weeks of age she was noted to have poor head control and a weak cry. She had excessive oral secretions and difficulty with clearing her airway. Over time, her head control slowly improved. She started to visually track and follow at the age of 6â7Â months. Her weight gain had stagnated between 6 and 12Â months, but by 19Â months her weight was above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile. Her length had been between the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles and her head circumference between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentiles. On examination at the age of 12Â months she was found to have a moderately high-arched palate and a weak cry. Extraocular movements were full, but she had aÂ recurrent intermittent horizontal nystagmus. She had diffuse hypotonia and weakness with poor truncal control, requiring head support. She was unable to sit and reach for objects. Her muscles were atrophic, and she had minimal antigravity movements in all extremities. Sensation appeared to be normal. Reflexes were 2+ in upper extremities, 1+ at the patellae, and absent at ankles. Plantar response was flexor.</p>
        <p id="p0135">EMG was suggestive of a motor neuropathy or motor neuronopathy. Brain MRI at the age of 6Â months showed cerebellar atrophy but a normal-appearing pons.

Muscle biopsy was suggestive of neurogenic atrophy with fiber-type grouping. Sural nerve biopsy was normal. EEG studies performed on multiple occasionsÂ were mostly read as normal, though one earlier study was interpreted as showing myoclonic discharges. Creatine kinase was borderline at 147Â U/L (reference range &lt; 143Â U/L). Cerebrospinal fluid studies for neurotransmitters were normal.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0200">We report four independent affected individuals with an early-onset progressive axonal motor neuronopathy, resulting in severe weakness and respiratory impairment, in combination with cerebellar atrophy. All affected individuals harbor autosomal-recessive variants in <italic>EXOSC9</italic>, which encodes an exosomal protein. Individual 2:II-1 presented with congenital fractures and arthrogryposis at birth and subsequent symptom progression resulting in respiratory failure and death at 15Â months of age. This individual carried the heterozygous null variant inÂ combination with the missense variant, whereas the three other affected individuals carried this missense in homozygosity; this might explain the more severe clinical presentation in individual 2:II-1. Individual 1:II-1 and individual 4:II-1 showed milder phenotypes, starting with congenital esotropia and congenital nystagmus, respectively, and poor head control in a relatively normal neonatal course. Significant developmental delay, progressive muscle weakness, oculomotor dysfunction, and coordination difficulties became evident only after 6Â months of age. In particular, the lower motor neuron symptoms subsequently progressed rapidly during the second year of life: these included limited spontaneous movement of the extremities, and individual 1:II-1 also required mechanical ventilation. Individual 3:II-1 had a more pronounced neonatal presentation with muscle hypotonia, weak cry, feeding difficulties, and early-onset seizures at the age of 5Â months. The phenotype of individual 3:II-1 could be partially due to another, yet to be identified, recessive genetic disorder segregating in the family, given the parental consanguinity and the history of a sister who had severe spasticity and epilepsy and passed away at age 8 years. Unfortunately, DNA from the sister of individual 3:II-1 was not available for genetic testing.</p>
      <p id="p0205">The involvement of spinal motor neurons together with cerebellar atrophy, with or without pontine involvement, is a common feature in affected individuals with variants in different exosomal subunit (<italic>EXOSC3</italic>, <italic>EXOSC8</italic>, and <italic>EXOSC9</italic>) and belongs to the spectrum of PCH1-related disorders. Although these variants typically present with severe weakness precluding sitting in most cases, variants in <italic>EXOSC3</italic> in particular are now recognized to also include a milder presentation. However, CNS hypomyelination has thus far been noted only in affected individuals with variants in <italic>EXOSC8</italic>. The presence of congenital symptoms in more severe exosomal protein defects suggests a developmental impairment; however, a progressive deterioration of motor skills in the first few months of life confirms that exosomal proteins are important not only for neuronal development but also for the survival of spinal motor and cerebellar neurons. Although the disease in our affected individuals fits into the PCH1 spectrum, the presence of congenital fractures in the severe case described here (individual 2:II-1) is reminiscent of congenital bone fractures with prenatal SMA caused by variants in subunits of the transcriptional coactivator complex, another disorder caused by abnormal RNA function.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Although not all affected individuals present with obvious pontocerebellar hypoplasia at birth, all affected individuals show cerebellar atrophy and signs of motor neuronopathy with onset in early childhood, suggesting the very characteristic involvement of the cerebellum and spinal motor neurons. Similar to PCH2, which results from variants in genes encoding subunits of the tRNA-splicing endonuclease complex (TSEN),<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> PCH1 has been also classified as PCH1A (<italic>VRK1</italic> variants), PCH1B (<italic>EXOSC3</italic> variants), and PCH1C (<italic>EXOSC8</italic> variants). We propose to classify the disease caused by <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variants as PCH1D. This would allow the characterization of the different phenotypes within each genotype.</p>
      <p id="p0210">In the four families reported here, we detected two different <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variants (c.41T&gt;C and c.481C&gt;T). Interestingly, haplotype analysis revealed a common haplotype shared among all three affected individuals homozygous for the c.41T&gt;C variant. Given the milder phenotype of affected individuals carrying this homozygous variant, we suspect that its loss of function is not as severe as in the case of the nonsense variant c.481C&gt;T. The presence of two severe nonsense variants in one individual would most likely result in intrauterine lethality, which has also been proposed for other exosomal protein variants in <italic>EXOSC8</italic><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and <italic>EXOSC3</italic>.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> We noted that there has been no case of a complete loss of function in any of the exosomal components, thus reinforcing our hypothesis that such a defect would be cause intrauterine lethality.</p>
      <p id="p0215">We detected reduced levels of the protein EXOSC9 in two affected individuals, indicating a loss-of-function effect of the variants, as we have shown previously for <italic>EXOSC8</italic> and <italic>RBM7</italic> variants. Notably, the other subunits of the exosome (EXOSC3 and EXOSC8) were also reduced, suggesting that the exosome complex cannot be assembled or might be unstable if one of the subunits is primarily reduced. This notion was also supported by the detection of a lower total amount of the entire exosome complex by BN-PAGE in all cells from affected individuals with exosome variants. The individuals with <italic>EXOSC8</italic> and <italic>EXOSC3</italic> variants and severe phenotypes demonstrate the most pronounced reduction of the whole exosome and its subunits, whereas the reduction of the exosome was less pronounced in affected individuals with <italic>EXOSC9</italic> (individual 1:II-1) and <italic>RBM7</italic> variants. This pathophysiological concept would suggest that the disease manifestations and their severity are more the result of the degree of overall exosome dysfunction rather than of a dysfunction of individual exosome components. This would be consistent with the similar nature of the âexosomopathiesâ as a group.</p>
      <p id="p0220">We performed RNA-seq analysis in fibroblasts and skeletal muscle of affected individuals with <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variants to investigate the effect of exosome impairment on the mRNA level. In fibroblasts, we detected significantly altered expression of genes involved in embryonic development of neurons <italic>(HOXB-A53</italic>, <italic>HOXB7</italic>, and <italic>HOXC8</italic>) and genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins and potassium channels, but we did not detect other neuron-specific gene alterations, probably because we studied fibroblasts and not neurons. RNA-seq in muscle showed altered gene expression of a high number of genes, suggesting that all tissues might be affected by the exosome defect. Expression of <italic>EXOSC9</italic> and other genes encoding exosomal proteins was not different from control levels, suggesting that the downregulation of the exosome proteins is not due to reduced gene expression but is probably secondary to the instability of the holocomplex. Some of the genes contained AREs, suggesting that <italic>EXOSC9</italic> variants affect the degradation of AU-rich transcripts, which is one of the best-known functions of the exosome in the cytosol. However, changes in gene expression of many non-AU-rich genes suggest a more widespread exosome function, potentially involving splicing and other forms of gene expression regulation. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of altered RNA metabolism in neurons.</p>
      <p id="p0225">We studied reduced <italic>exosc9</italic> in an <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> model by morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish embryos. Morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown is an established technique used for modeling diseases in zebrafish, although there has been recent criticism of the specificity of the morpholino oligonucleotides and suggestions of âoff-targetâ effects.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> To address this potential problem, we complementarily used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to produce mosaic âcrispantâ zebrafish<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Knockdown and mutagenesis of <italic>exosc9</italic> produced similar phenotypes in zebrafish, which suggests that both methods specifically target and reduce <italic>exosc9</italic>, although we could not find any antibody that successfully identified any of the exosome components in zebrafish to prove that there was indeed a reduction at the protein level.</p>
      <p id="p0230">The phenotype caused by the reduction of <italic>exosc9</italic> in zebrafish is generally consistent with the phenotypic aspects (in particular, cerebellar defects and motor neuron pathology) seen in the four affected individuals. The phenotype of the <italic>exosc9</italic> morphants and crispants was also similar to that observed in <italic>exosc3</italic>, <italic>exosc8</italic>, and <italic>rbm7</italic> morphant zebrafish.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Interestingly, other zebrafish models of cerebellar hypoplasia and atrophy caused by abnormal RNA processing have a phenotype similar to that of the <italic>exosc9</italic> downregulated zebrafish. Morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of <italic>Toe1</italic> caused midbrain and hindbrain degeneration.<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> TOE1 has roles in RNA degradation, and variants in <italic>TOE1</italic> have been reported in affected individuals with PCH7. TSEN variants and the associated protein CLP1 have been associated with PCH in affected individuals.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Morpholino knockdown of these genes in zebrafish embryos also recapitulated the phenotype seen in affected individuals. Together, these studies highlight the consistency of zebrafish as a model of cerebellar hypoplasia and atrophy in particular in disorders of RNA processing.</p>
      <p id="p0235">Morpholino knockdown of <italic>exosc9</italic> has previously been performed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos.<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> However, the <italic>Xenopus exosc9</italic> morphants had defects in skin development but not the cerebellum. The discrepancy between zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> could be due to inherent differences in the models, or it could simply be that the cerebellum was not examined in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> morphants. Our results here show that zebrafish are a useful tool for generating rapid <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> models of rare genetic diseases involving the development of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
      <p id="p0240">In summary, we have described four independent individuals who are affected by variants in <italic>EXOSC9</italic> and who presented with motor axonopathy resembling SMA, cerebellar atrophy, and in one affected individual, multiple bone fractures. These <italic>EXOSC9</italic>-related phenotypes closely resemble the clinical spectrum of other exosomal defects, which could be referred to as âexosomopathies.â The clinically unique combination of a motor neuronopathy with cerebellar atrophy typical for the exosomopathies link the other two major clinical groups of the disorders of RNA processing, namely SMA without cerebellar involvement on the one end and the pontocerebellar hypoplasias without SMA on the other. Molecular studies indicate that the pathology is linked to a loss of function of theÂ RNA processing by the exosome. Further studies on neuronal cells of affected individuals or zebrafish neurons might reveal neuron-specific alterations, which could be targeted in future interventions.</p>
