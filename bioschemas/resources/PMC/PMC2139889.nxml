      <abstract>
        <p>Serine phosphorylation of human pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) by A431 human carcinoma cells results in a catalytically active molecule with reduced sensitivity to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. We mapped the phosphorylated seryl residues by analyzing the in vivo phosphorylation state of engineered prouPA variants carrying a COOH-terminal poly-histidine tag. Stably transfected A431 cells do not incorporate radioactive phosphate into tagged pro-uPA in which the serines 138 and 303 have been replaced with glutamic residues, although endogenous nontagged pro-uPA is <sup>32</sup>P-labeled on A and B chains. Moreover, the catalyticindependent ability of the mono- and di-substituted âphosphorylation-likeâ variants to bind to the GPIanchored urokinase receptor (uPAR) and promote adherence of differentiating U937, HL-60, and THP-1 myelomonocytic cells was examined. We found that glutamic residues as well as the naturally occurring phosphoserines at positions 138 and 303 abolish proadhesive ability, although they do not interfere with receptor binding. In addition, pro-uPA carrying Glu<sup>138/303</sup> lacks the capability to induce a chemotactic response of THP-1 cells. The exclusive presence of Glu<sup>138</sup> reduces pro-uPA proadhesive and chemotactic ability by 70â 80%, indicating that a phosphoserine residue at the same position plays a major inhibitory role of myeloid cell response to pro-urokinase. The di-substitution does not affect pro-uPA ability to interact with vitronectin or to enhance binding of urea-denatured vitronectin to uPAR. However, unlike wild-type tagged pro-uPA, the di-substituted variant does not induce receptor polarization in pre-adherent U937 cells. Taken together, the data support the possibility that pro-uPA phosphorylation on Ser<sup>138/303</sup> can modulate uPAR transducing ability.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Urokinase (uPA)<sup>1</sup>, one of the two plasminogen activators, is a secreted serine protease which converts the latent ubiquitous zymogen plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is, in turn, capable of degrading a variety of intravascular proteins, such as fibrin and extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycans, as well as activating type IV pro-collagenase, thus indirectly hydrolyzing collagen (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dano et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
    <p>Urokinase catalyzes the rate-limiting step of this proteolytic cascade, thereby regulating a variety of events that require extracellular proteolysis, such as cell migration, tissue remodeling and involution, and tumor metastatization (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blasi et al., 1994</xref>). Increasing evidence shows that the complex regulation of uPA activity and localization is accomplished through the integration of multiple modulators. These include specific inhibitors of the proteolytic activity, namely plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2) and protease nexin (PN), which directly interact with uPA catalytic moiety (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blasi et al., 1987</xref>). Cell surfaceâassociated plasminogen activation is achieved through the high affinity binding of uPA to the GPI-anchored urokinase receptor (uPAR) (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Vassalli et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Stoppelli et al., 1985</xref>, 1986. <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Roldan et al., 1990</xref>). Secreted pro-urokinase is a zymogen that must be proteolytically cleaved in two fragments (namely, A and B chain) to display its full enzymatic activity, either in solution or on the cell surface: cell-associated plasmin cleaves receptor-bound pro-uPA with an efficiency 50-fold higher than plasmin in solution (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Stephens et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 1989</xref>). Furthermore, the activation of cell-associated plasminogen by receptorbound uPA is characterized by a 40-fold reduction in the K<sub>m</sub> for plasminogen activation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 1991</xref>). The membrane-bound plasmin activity generated by cellbound plasminogen is protected by inactivation from serum inhibitors, but it can be modulated by the plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cubellis et al., 1990</xref>). Receptor-bound uPA:PAI-1 complexes can be cleared from the cell surface via the Î±<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin receptorâlow density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Conese et al., 1994</xref>). Many observations have suggested that uPAR could direct uPA-dependent proteolysis to discrete regions of pericellular matrix, where the degrading activity is required by cells engaged in migratory processes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Estreicher et al., 1990</xref>). Considerable evidence has been accumulated which indicates that receptor-bound uPA provides cells with a very efficient invasion machinery (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Carriero et al., 1994</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dano et al., 1994</xref>). However, recent findings uncover additional roles for ligand-stimulated uPAR: in particular, the ability of pro-uPA to trigger uPAR-dependent cell responses, such as cell migration, proliferation, chemotaxis, adherence, tyrosine phosphorylation, and transcription of specific genes, has received considerable attention (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kirchheimer et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Nusrat and Chapman, 1991</xref>; Del Rosso et al., 1993; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dumler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Busso et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gyetko et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 1995</xref>). In most cases, uPA proteolytic activity is not required, as the same effect is exerted by catalytically inactivated uPA (DFP-uPA) or its amino-terminal domain (ATF, aminoacids 1-135). In both cases, the occurrence of a COOH-terminal lysine (Lys<sup>135</sup> or Lys<sup>158</sup>) is critical to the proadhesive effect (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1995</xref>). Like other proteases of the fibrinolytic and blood coagulation systems bearing large noncatalytic domains involved in the interaction with regulatory macromolecules, pro-uPA includes a 157âamino acid NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal moiety (A chain) which comprises the âgrowth factor-likeâ domain responsible for uPAR binding, the kringle domain, and the so called âmini-chain,â which precedes the Ile<sup>157</sup>-Lys<sup>158</sup> activation site (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Patthy, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Appella et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 1994</xref>). The occurrence of ATF-dependent events leading to cell activation raises an important question concerning the mechanisms underlying the signaling ability of uPAR, as this receptor lacks a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic region, which could link it to the intracellular signal transduction pathways. Reversible association with CR3, the complement receptor type III (CD11b/CD18) both in neutrophils and in monocytes, has been reported (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kindzelskii et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sitrin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, Î²2-integrins, Src kinases, and uPAR have been found in a single complex from monocytes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bohuslav et al., 1995</xref>). Also, functional evidence for the existence of a transmembrane adaptor in THP-1 monocyte-like cells has been recently provided (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Resnati et al., 1996</xref>). Although most of the uPAR-dependent cell responses are triggered by its ligand, little attention has been given to the role of uPA in the early steps of receptor activation. Cultured myelomonocytic cell lines, like U937, HL-60, and THP-1, can be induced to differentiate with TGF-Î²/vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, and, if further treated with nanomolar concentrations of uPA or ATF, they acquire an adherent phenotype within minutes (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Waltz et al., 1993</xref>). Differentiation of U937 cells into cells displaying macrophage-like properties is accompanied by an increase in the number of uPARs which parallels the acquisition of an adherent phenotype (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Stoppelli et al., 1985</xref>; Picone at al., 1989). Also, THP-1 motility is greatly stimulated by uPA or ATF or proteolytically cleaved soluble uPAR (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Resnati et al., 1996</xref>). To shed light on these ligand-dependent signaling processes, we analyzed the functional effects of pro-uPA serine phosphorylation on uPAR-dependent chemotaxis and adhesion. We have previously found that pro-urokinase synthesized by A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells is phosphorylated on seryl residues located within the A chain and the B chain, respectively (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mastronicola et al., 1990</xref>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of uPA from human urine and from HT-1080 cell line has also been reported (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barlati et al., 1991</xref>). Phosphate groups linked to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues have been detected in pro-uPA secreted from human melanoma cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barlati et al., 1995</xref>). Functional consequences of phosphorylation have been described: we have shown that serine phosphorylated uPA from A431 cells is severely impaired in its interaction with PAI-1, although its catalytic activity is not affected (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mastronicola et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Franco et al., 1992</xref>). Moreover, an increased catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) has been reported for uPA phosphorylated by the Detroit 562 carcinomatous cells (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 1992</xref>). Early efforts directed to the identification of pro-uPA phosphorylation sites in A431 cell line, by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, have tentatively identified Ser<sup>138</sup> and Ser<sup>303</sup> as major phosphorylation sites (Welinder, K., M.P. Stoppelli, and F. Blasi, unpublished observations). In this paper, we describe the construction and the high level expression of engineered COOH-terminal histidine-tagged pro-uPAs carrying single amino-acid substitutions which alter the presumptive phosphorylation sites. These âphosphorylation-likeâ variants have been employed for a final identification of the phosphorylation sites in vivo, and for a functional analysis of single phosphoserines at critical sites of pro-uPA. Evidence is provided that the naturally occurring phosphate groups on Ser<sup>138/303</sup>, as well as glutamic residues mimicking phosphoseryl residues at the same locations, strongly impair uPA ability to induce uPAR-dependent myelomonocytic adherence and motility.</p>

        <title>Subcloning of pro-uPA Gene and Site-directed Mutagenesis of Its cDNA</title>
        <p>A SacIIâSspI fragment encompassing the pro-uPA gene, lacking the nontranslated exon I, was excised from pRSV-uPA (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Riccio et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Nolli et al., 1989</xref>; see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and subcloned in pcDNA neo I linearized with EcoRV (pcDNAneo-uPA gene). pcUK176 from R. Miskin (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) was the source of uPA cDNA (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axelrod et al., 1989</xref>). Mutations were generated by PCR amplification with pFC16 as template (described in <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Orsini et al., 1991</xref>). The oligonucleotides employed are n.1: 5â²-TTC T<underline>TC</underline>

In particular, for the S138E mutation, two cDNA fragments were amplified using, respectively, primers n.6+1 and n.1/2+5. Both the fragments were then restricted, respectively, with BglII+AccIII and AccIII alone and subcloned into the pFC16 vector digested with the same enzymes, therefore substituting the nonmutagenized fragments. For the cloning procedure, in the primers n.1 and n.1/2, an AccIII site has been introduced with no change in the protein sequence. For the S303E mutation, only one fragment was amplified using primers n.6+3 and subcloned directly into the pFC16 vector, as described above. As a result, the codons encoding Ser<sup>138</sup> (TCC) and Ser<sup>303</sup> (TCT) were converted to GAA which specifies for Glu (positions 2413 and 3794 of the uPA gene, according to <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Riccio et al., 1985</xref>). Successful mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. </p>

After the transfection, the cells were diluted up to 3 ml and plated in a 6-cm dish. The medium was replaced 24 h later and the cells assayed 48 h after the transfection. Stable A431 transfectants were obtained by electroporating 10<sup>7</sup> subconfluent A431 cells at 360 V, 960 Î¼Faraday with 80 Î¼g of plasmid DNA, in 0.9 ml of culture medium.

        <title>High Level Expression of COOH-Terminal Histidine-tagged Pro-Urokinase and Its Variants</title>
        <p>Early work from our laboratory has shown that the in vivo <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) from A431 human carcinoma cell line is phosphorylated at least on two serine residues, being located within the A and the B chain, respectively (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mastronicola et al., 1990</xref>). Further efforts directed to the localization of the phosphorylation sites by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of A431 pro-uPA tentatively identified Ser<sup>138</sup> and/or Ser<sup>303</sup> as major sites (Welinder, K., M.P. Stoppelli, and F. Blasi, unpublished observations). This paper addresses the localization of pro-uPA phosphoseryl residues by an independent approach. As described in Materials and Methods, pro-uPA cDNA has been subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to encode prouPA variants carrying a replacement of Ser<sup>138</sup> and/or Ser<sup>303</sup> with glutamic acid residues. However, transient transfection of these cDNAs driven by SV40 or CMV promoters in HeLa cells resulted in a barely detectable level of prouPA, whereas a 10â20-fold greater amount of secreted prouPA was obtained from the genomic version under the same conditions (not shown). The latter finding raises the possibility that the presence of pro-uPA intronic regulatory sequences may stabilize its mRNA, therefore suggesting that a greater expression may arise from intron-bearing units encoding the full pro-uPA or its variants. On the other hand, the requirement of, at least, one intron for optimal mRNA accumulation has been shown for many genes, including those encoding Î²-globin, ribosomal protein L 32, tissue plasminogen activator, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Buchman and Berg, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Gorman, 1990</xref>). Also, some genes require specific sequences for intron-independent gene expression (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Mertz, 1995</xref>). In this case, although pcDNAneoI vector carries SV40 transcription termination and RNA processing signals to enhance mRNA stability, the expression of pro-uPA cDNA was unsatisfying: therefore, a minimum of four introns, derived from pro-uPA gene, were inserted upstream to the cDNA fragments carrying the mutations of interest, following a strategy described in Materials and Methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The protein encoded by these new intron-bearing units or âmini-genesâ is the 431 amino acids âpre-prourokinase,â which is secreted concomitantly to the signal peptide removal (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Riccio et al., 1985</xref>). Then, the expression level of these mini-genes, driven by CMV promoter in pcDNAneoI vector, was tested in transient transfections of HeLa cells: the results confirmed that fusion of genomic sequences to the 5â² region of pro-uPA cDNA enables accumulation of mRNA and protein to an intermediate level as compared to the expression level of pro-uPA gene or cDNA (not shown).</p>
        <p>To selectively analyze the in vivo phosphorylation state of pro-uPA specific variants, we had to take into account the endogenous high level of pro-uPA in A431 cell line. Therefore, a polyhistidine tagging was designed, as it does not contain any phosphorylatable amino acid and, also, should not interfere with protein secretion, if inserted at the COOH-terminal end of the protein (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bush et al., 1991</xref>). Also, it ensures rapid and efficient purification based on its high affinity interaction with Ni<sup>2+</sup>Sepharose (Ni-NTA). As described in Materials and Methods, a double strand oligonucleotide encoding the COOH-terminal region of pro-uPA, downstream to the BamHI site (exon XI), followed by an exahistidyl peptide and a stop codon, was cloned into the BamHIâXhoI excised pcDNAneoI vector. Afterwards, a BamHI fragment containing most of the prouPA gene or the mini-genes was inserted into the unique BamHI site. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, upper part, a histidinetagged fusion protein with a slightly different carboxy-terminal sequence (His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>) was generated. To test the in vivo expression of this construct and the purification procedure of histidine-tagged pro-uPA, a transient transfection of HeLa cells, displaying no detectable endogenous pro-uPA, was performed. The cells were transfected as described in Materials and Methods and, 48 h later, labeled with 100 Î¼Ci/ml of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 18 h. As shown by the similar patterns displayed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (lower part), incubation of the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled HeLa transfectants' conditioned medium with either 5B4-agarose or Ni<sup>2+</sup>Sepharose resulted in the purification of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>. In control experiments, untagged pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>, encoded by pcDNAI bearing uPA gene, could exclusively be purified with antiuPA antibody and not by Ni-NTA chromatography. In both cases, pro-uPA exhibits a mol wt of â¼47 kD: the lower mol wt bands correspond to the A and B chains of pro-uPA which undergoes partial activation in cell culture. In other experiments, a tag-dependent, slightly decreased electrophoretic mobility of B chain was detected (not shown). Parallel ELISA and enzymatic assays of purified His-prouPA<sup>wt</sup> suggested no major effects of COOH-terminal tagging on its catalytic activity (not shown).</p>

        <title>Identification of A431 Pro-Urokinase Phosphoseryl Residues</title>
        <p>PcDNAneoI vector carrying either pro-uPA gene encoding His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or the mini-gene encoding His-prouPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> was stably transfected into A431 epidermoid carcinoma cell line. Two geneticin-resistant clones, producing 1.5â2 Î¼g pro-uPA/10<sup>6</sup> cells in 18 h, were selected for further studies. To rule out the possibility that His-tagging may affect pro-uPA in vivo phosphorylation, a preliminary experiment was designed in which the phosphorylation level of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> was compared to that of untagged endogenous pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>. In agreement with the previously reported phosphorylation pattern, in both cases, three bands can be observed under reducing conditions corresponding to the single (47 kD) and two-chain uPA (30 kD and 17 kD, respectively), following metabolic labeling with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine or [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). </p>
        <p>To assess the in vivo phosphorylation state of pro-urokinase in which neither Ser<sup>138</sup> nor Ser<sup>303</sup> are available any longer, the phosphorylation state of His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> was analyzed and endogenous pro-uPA (pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>) was used as a reference. This approach allows the simultaneous analysis of both proteins, so excluding any effect due to clonal variability. 1 10-cm dish of subconfluent A431 transfectants was labeled with 200 Î¼Ci/ml of [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate and one dish was incubated with 100 Î¼Ci/ml of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, to ensure an internal control of prouPA synthesis. In both cases, 18 h later, the conditioned medium was subjected to the Ni-NTA chromatography to isolate His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>; the unbound proteins have been further incubated with the 5B4 anti-uPA monoclonal antibody to recover endogenous untagged pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>. The resulting samples have been loaded onto a 12.5% SDSPAGE under reducing conditions. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>B</italic> shows that the recovered untagged pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> is labeled with <sup>35</sup>S and <sup>32</sup>P. Conversely, His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> is exclusively labeled with <sup>35</sup>S and not with <sup>32</sup>P. Quantitation of the enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitates confirmed that the same amount of pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> and His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> is indeed present in the last two samples shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>B</italic> (not shown). The lack of His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> in vivo phosphorylation clearly establishes that pro-uPA phosphorylation by A431 cells is totally dependent on the availability of Ser<sup>138</sup> and Ser<sup>303</sup>.</p>

        <title>Receptor Binding Ability of Phosphorylated Pro-uPA and Its âPhosphorylation-likeâ Variants</title>
        <p>The localization of pro-uPA phosphorylation sites does not suggest functional consequences on uPAR binding, as the growth factor-like domain does not include any phosphoserine. However, given the possibility that negatively charged side chains may trigger conformational changes even at distant sites, we analyzed the uPAR binding ability of phosphorylated pro-uPA. Previous work has shown that A431 human carcinoma cells synthesize pro-uPA and bind it to cell surface receptors in an autocrine fashion. According to a previously published protocol, receptor-bound pro-uPA can be extracted by a short acidic treatment of A431 cells (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Stoppelli et al., 1986</xref>). Here we demonstrate that acid-released pro-uPA from the surface of A431 cells, which have been metabolically labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]orthophosphate, is indeed <sup>32</sup>P-labeled. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>A</italic> shows the immunoprecipitated 47-kD protein from neutralized acid wash of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled A431 cells with 5B4 anti-uPA antibody (lane <italic>2</italic>), analyzed onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Incubation of the same extract with an irrelevant antibody confirms the specificity of the reaction (lane <italic>1</italic>); however, this experiment could only detect a severe impairment of receptor binding ability, but it does not draw any conclusion on the affinity of phosphorylated prouPA for uPAR. To address this question, conditioned medium from A431 cells was fractionated with the Fe<sup>3+</sup> Sepharose chromatography. As previously published, this matrix only retains phosphorylated uPA (Pser-uPA) which can be subsequently eluted by raising the pH and washing the column with a phosphate buffer (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Franco et al., 1992</xref>). A further immunoaffinity step allows purified phosphorylated uPA to recover and to test its affinity for uPAR. No major differences in the relative <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub>s for uPAR were detected in binding assays in which unlabeled Pser-uPA or human urinary uPA were used as competitors of <sup>125</sup>I-ATF binding to monocyte-like U937 cells, at the concentrations reported in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B.</italic>
</p>
        <p>Although the functional analysis of in vivo phosphorylated uPA could benefit from the Fe<sup>3+</sup> Sepharose chromatography technique, this procedure does not allow purification of pro-uPAs homogeneously phosphorylated at one or both relevant sites. So, to investigate the functional consequences of pro-uPA phosphorylation at single sites, we analyzed the above described phosphorylation-like prouPA variants in which glutamic residues are expected to mimic the presence of phosphate groups (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Maciejewski et al., 1995</xref>). In this set of experiments, we took advantage of the inability of HeLa cells to neither phosphorylate Ser<sup>138</sup> nor Ser<sup>303</sup>, thus allowing individual analysis of the glutamic substitutions (Iaccarino, C., P. Franco, and M.P. Stoppelli, unpublished observations). For this reason, stably transfected HeLa cells overexpressing His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>, His-prouPA<sup>138E</sup>, or His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>, at 1â2 Î¼g uPA/10<sup>6</sup> cells in 20 h, have been obtained. Histidine-tagged pro-uPA variants have been purified on large scale Ni-NTA Sepharose chromatography and quantitated by indirect enzymatic assay, as phosphorylation of pro-uPA does not affect its kinetic parameters for plasminogen activation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Franco et al., 1992</xref>). The results show that the receptor binding ability of unlabeled His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> is indistinguishable from that of urinary uPA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). In addition, the affinity of His-pro-uPA<sup>138E</sup> and His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> for uPAR is similar to that of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>, as shown by comparing the relative <italic>K</italic>
<sub>dâ</sub>s. In all cases, half-maximal binding is attained â¼0.4 nM, a value which is in the expected <italic>K</italic>

        <title>Effect of Phosphorylation on Pro-Urokinase Ability to Induce Adhesion of Differentiating Myeloid Cells</title>
        <p>As reported by others (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Nusrat and Chapman, 1991</xref>), the proadhesive ability of uPA on differentiating myelomonocytic cell lines depends on receptor binding and is independent of uPA catalytic activity. However, the possibility that additional interactions involving uPA and matrix or membrane-associated proteins may concur to promote U937 cell adherence cannot be excluded. Cells were induced to differentiation with TGF-Î²/vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 20 h and then incubated in tissue culture multiwell plates for 30 min in the presence of 10% FBS, with or without 1 nM of various effectors. In the assay shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, the adhesion promoted by 1 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> was taken as 100%. A single amino acid substitution at position 138 of histidine-tagged pro-uPA causes, at least, a 60% reduction of its proadhesive ability. It is noteworthy that His-prouPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>, in which the two amino acid substitutions are combined, fails to increase adhesion. Similar relative data were obtained using the same effectors at the concentration of 0.2 nM (not shown). The lack of stimulation is neither due to undesired mutations of the selected clones, nor to the COOH-terminal polyhistidine sequence, as it has been observed with untagged pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> purified from independent HeLa transfectants (not shown). Accordingly, A431 phosphorylated pro-uPA (Pser-uPA) shows a poor proadhesive ability with respect to the nonphosphorylated counterpart (Ser-uPA), at the same concentration (1 nM). In this case, the occurrence of nonphosphorylated molecules or molecules phosphorylated at single sites may likely account for the reduced, although still appreciable proadhesive effect of Pser-uPA, as compared to the disubstituted variant. Furthermore, the reduced proadhesive ability of Pser-uPA is not due to its inhibition-insensitive enzymatic activity, as it can be observed even after DFP treatment, which inactivates the residual two-chain activity. Consistently, the irreversible inactivation of two-chain uPA in the preparation of the phosphorylation-like variants did not alter the relative extent of the proadhesive effect. The proadhesive ability of pro-uPA is uPAR-dependent, as it can be prevented by pre-saturating the cells with anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody before the addition of the effectors. Also, 5 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> can reverse the proadhesive effect of 1 nM pro-uPA, further supporting the possibility that binding to the receptor is required for the negative effect of the di-substituted variant. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>B</italic> shows the percentage of differentiating U937 cells which have acquired adherence in the presence of increasing concentrations of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>. The results indicate that the di-substituted variant is indeed no longer capable to exert a proadhesive effect, even at concentrations 10-fold higher than those employed in the previous experiments. Further testing of the effects of phosphorylation on pro-uPA proadhesive ability employed THP-1 and HL-60 cell lines, all belonging to the myelomonocytic lineage. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>, treatment of âprimedâ THP-1 and HL-60 cell lines with 0.2 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> under the conditions described for U937 cells causes 20â 25% of the cells to adhere to culture plates, in the presence of 10% FBS. A substantial reduction is observed with the monosubstituted variant His-pro-uPA<sup>138E</sup>, which approximately retains 20â25% of the wild-type proadhesive ability. As for U937 cell line, no proadhesive effect is exerted by the di-substituted variant. </p>

        <p>It is known that pro-uPA or ATF can stimulate a chemotactic response of THP-1 monocyte-like cells: in this experiment, the extent of cell migration along a gradient formed by His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or the relative phosphorylation-like variants was estimated. According to a procedure reported by <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Resnati et al. (1996)</xref>, THP-1 cells were allowed to migrate in modified Boyden chambers. Directional migration was assessed by counting the total cell number on the lower side of each filter and reporting it as a percentage of basal cell migration in the absence of chemoattractant. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, 0.2 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> does stimulate directional migration, unlike His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> which fails to stimulate THP-1 cell motility at the same concentration (we could detect even a slightly reduced migration with respect to random migration). Similar to the relative effects on adherence, His-pro-uPA<sup>138E</sup> retains â¼30% of the chemotactic ability of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>. Consistently, Pser-uPA from A431 cells is a weaker chemotactic agent than Ser-uPA. Nonreversible inactivation by DFP does not alter the chemotactic ability of any of the pro-uPAs, showing that none of the observed effects is due to the trace amount of two-chain uPA in the preparation. </p>

        <title>Interaction of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> and His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> with Vitronectin and uPAR</title>
        <p>To gain some insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the impaired signaling ability of pro-uPA phosphorylated on Ser<sup>138/303</sup>, we investigated the direct interaction of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> and His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> with denatured vitronectin. Varying amounts of vitronectin were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with <sup>125</sup>I-His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or <sup>125</sup>I-His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>, according to a procedure published by <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Moser et al. (1995)</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, both variants react to the same extent to 1.25 Î¼g, 2.5 Î¼g, and 5 Î¼g of vitronectin whereas they do not show an appreciable interaction with 5 Î¼g of fibronectin or collagen. </p>
        <p>The possibility that phosphorylation of pro-uPA may interfere with uPAR binding to vitronectin was examined. For this experiment, urea-denatured vitronectin, which mimics the matrix-like form of vitronectin, was employed (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 1994</xref>). Primed U937 cells were either incubated in RPMI without any effector or with 10 nM recombinant pro-uPA, or His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>, in the presence of <sup>125</sup>I-vitronectin. At the end of the incubation, the cell-associated radioactivity was assessed. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>B</italic>, binding of <sup>125</sup>I-vitronectin to the cells was similarly enhanced by all pro-uPAs used, ruling out the possibility that His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> may interfere with uPAR/ vitronectin interaction.</p>

        <title>Chemotactic Ability of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> in Nonmyelomonocytic Cell Lines</title>
        <p>Next, we investigated whether the lack of effect by the disubstituted phosphorylation-like variant can be exclusively observed in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage, where uPAR interacts with the Î²2-integrin CD11b/CD18 or Mac-1 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bohuslav et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, the chemotactic ability of His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> and Hispro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> was tested in A431 human carcinoma and mouse LB6-19, overexpressing human uPAR. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>, His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> is a chemotactic factor, capable of enhancing random cell migration of both cell lines. On the contrary, the di-substituted variant fails to stimulate cell motility in both cases. The data also show that migration directed by His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> is unaffected by 10 Î¼g/ml antivitronectin antibodies, suggesting that uPAR binding to vitronectin is not a prerequisite for uPA-dependent A431 cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that the lack of His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> chemotactic ability is not dependent on tissue-specific, uPAR-associated factors and raise the possibility that binding of phosphorylated prouPA may cause a general impairment of receptor function. </p>

        <title>Cellular Distribution of uPA Receptors in Preadherent U937 Cells</title>
        <p>Like other GPI-anchored proteins, uPAR lateral mobility in the cell membrane allows its ligand-dependent migration toward specific regions of the cell (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Myohanen et al., 1993</xref>). By the aid of immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we tested uPAR distribution in primed U937 cells, further treated with 10 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> or Hispro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> for 1 h. Cells were fixed, incubated with affinity-purified anti-uPAR rabbit polyclonal antibody, and subsequently incubated with FITC-conjugated antiâ rabbit IgG. Cells were kept in suspension throughout the entire procedure, so to exclude any effect of cell attachment on uPAR localization. First, the distribution of fluorescence in the 0.75-Î¼m section at the cell equator was analyzed. Primed cells exhibited primarily a diffused staining pattern at the membrane level, with occasional concentration of fluorescence at one cell edge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>Aâ²</italic>). After treatment with His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>, uPAR staining became distinctly polarized in â¼70% of preadherent U937 cells (<italic>B</italic> and <italic>Bâ²</italic>). On the contrary, treatment with the phosphorylation-like variant results in uPAR redistribution only in 20% of the cell population (<italic>C</italic> and <italic>Câ²</italic>). These values were calculated by taking sequential through-focus images of single cells, as fluorescent patches can be detected only by analyzing specific focal planes of preadherent cells (<italic>D</italic>). The data show that preadherent U937 cells undergo a ligand-dependent uPAR redistribution, which is severely impaired in cells treated with the phosphorylation-like, disubstituted pro-uPA variant. </p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism of prourokinase proadhesive and chemotactic ability in myelomonocytic cells, which depends on phosphorylation at specific serine residues. First, we have identified Ser<sup>138/303</sup> as the in vivo major phosphorylation sites of pro-uPA synthesized by A431 human carcinoma cells. Second, by analyzing histidine-tagged pro-uPA variants carrying Glu<sup>138</sup> and/or Glu<sup>303</sup> to mimic the occurrence of specific phosphoserines, we found that the di-substitution strongly impairs pro-uPA ability to promote myelomonocytic motility and adherence, although it does not alter the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> of uPA for its receptor. Third, we found that the monosubstituted variant His-pro-uPA<sup>138E</sup> only retains 20â30% of the wild-type proadhesive and chemotactic ability. These results were confirmed by parallel controls with naturally occurring phosphorylated pro-uPA from A431 cells. Finally, the disubstituted variant does bind to vitronectin, but it does not stimulate uPAR polarization in preadherent U937 monocytes. The data reported here indicate that phosphorylation of pro-uPA may modulate uPAR signaling ability, possibly interfering with uPAR mobilization and dynamic association with other membrane partners.</p>
      <p>The requirement for receptor binding is further confirmed by the finding that deletion of amino acids 10-135, which include the growth factor domain, renders pro-uPA totally unable to interact with uPAR and to stimulate adherence (Chiaradonna, F., P. Franco, and M.P. Stoppelli, unpublished observations). In addition, previous work has shown that the amino-terminal fragment of uPA, namely ATF, completely retains pro-urokinase proadhesive ability (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Nusrat and Chapman, 1991</xref>). However, these findings do not exclude that other regions of pro-uPA may modulate its signaling mechanism. One of the two phosphorylation sites lies within a small region connecting A and B chain of pro-uPA (135-158), or âmini-chainâ: The finding that a negatively charged side chain at position 138 causes a 70â 80% reduction of both proadhesive and chemotactic ability of pro-uPA suggests that the surrounding region may be responsible for critical interactions with membrane- associated proteins, provided pro-uPA is receptor-bound. Additional information on the relevance of uPA mini-chain region to the uPA-enhanced adhesivness of U937 cells is provided by Gurewich and coworkers which showed that removal of Lys<sup>135</sup> or Lys<sup>158</sup> with carboxypeptidase A impairs uPA proadhesive effect, whereas it does not affect uPAR binding (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1995</xref>). These data, taken together, may lead to the conclusion that different local charges may exert opposite effects on uPA proadhesive ability and raise the possibility that the conformation of the mini-chain region may fulfill a regulatory function of uPA-dependent signaling. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that intramolecular charge interactions in phosphorylated uPA may preclude proper formation of a functional contact region, thereby suppressing uPA-dependent signaling. In our experiments, Glu<sup>303</sup> seems to enhance the effects of Glu<sup>138</sup>: this may lead to the interpretation that either the full pro-uPA molecule bears two distant regions of interaction or that, in receptor-bound pro-uPA, Glu<sup>303</sup> is spatially closer to Glu<sup>138</sup>, thereby enhancing the local negative charge. On the other hand, NMR analysis of pro-urokinase has shown a substantial independent motion between individual domains of the protein (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al., 1989</xref>). Functional alterations due to single phosphorylation sites or to negatively charged amino acids (Asp or Glu) replacing phosphoserines are not unique to this case: phosphorylation of Ser<sup>78</sup> in the c-Jun transcriptional regulator enhances its DNA binding activity and so does the variant carrying Asp<sup>78</sup>. The transcriptional regulator p53, if phosphorylated on Ser<sup>389</sup>, lacks its growth suppressor function; regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase by phosphorylation of Ser<sup>113</sup> leads to enzyme inactivation, which can be mimicked by substituting the critical Ser with Glu or Asp (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hoeffler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rolley and Milner, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hurley et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
      <p>A challenging question concerns the upstream molecular events of the uPAR-directed signaling, as this receptor, lacking a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic region, is associated to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blasi et al., 1994</xref>). Very little is known about the ligand-dependent activation and the early signaling steps of GPI-anchored proteins. However, their lateral mobility may be important for a dynamic coupling to integral membrane proteins and therefore relevant to their transducing ability (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Robinson, 1991</xref>). It has recently been reported that uPAR can interact with integrin receptors: Work by <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (1996)</xref> has shown complex formation between uPAR and Î²1- or Î²2-integrins, which suggested this as the link between uPAR and cytoskeleton, therefore providing a mechanistic explanation for uPAR signaling. In neutrophils, the interaction between uPAR and CD11b/ CD18 (Mac-1) is highly dynamic and depends upon cell shape change from a spherical to a polarized morphology during locomotion; interestingly, uPARs are concentrated in lamellipodia-type structures (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kindzelskii et al., 1996</xref>). It is known that uPA binding to uPAR induces its relocalization to focal contact sites in human fibroblasts and rabdomyosarcoma cells (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Myohanen et al., 1993</xref>). Others have shown that uPAR undergoes ligand-dependent conformational changes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Plough et al., 1994</xref>). This paper shows that uPAR signaling ability may be modulated by single amino acid substitutions in its ligand, in a nontissue-specific and vitronectin-independent manner. We also show that wildtype tagged pro-uPA can induce uPAR redistribution in preadherent U937 cells, and that this ligand-dependent effect is prevented by phosphorylation of pro-uPA on Ser<sup>138/303</sup>. The blockage of uPAR-dependent signaling is further supported by the evidence that in cells treated with the di-substituted variant, we could not observe cytoskeletal rearrangements, as in preadherent cells (Chiaradonna, F., and M.P. Stoppelli, unpublished observations). Although the mechanistic role of pro-uPA as a trigger of motility and adhesion is presently unclear, different pieces of evidence may converge on the possibility that ligand-activated uPAR has an increased lateral mobility which allows its rapid redistribution to specific membrane regions and, perhaps, a particular conformation leading to its dynamic association with specific receptors. However, these aspects deserve further investigation.</p>
      <p>In any event, an interesting conclusion may be drawn from the inability of phosphorylated pro-uPA to stimulate both myelomonocytic adherence and motility, which suggests that these two processes share some common mediators in myelomonocytic cells. This finding is not surprising, as the formation of adhesive cell-matrix contacts in cell spreading and migration results from cooperation between the membrane-associated adhesive systems, the actin cytoskeleton, and the generation of force across regions of the cell. Cell migration implies the occurrence of cytoskeletalmediated process extension (filopodia and lamellipodia) and retraction, together with the formation and disruption of adhesive contacts at the leading edge of the cell. In particular, focal adhesions comprise integrins as the major adhesion receptors and are thought to serve as sites for coordination between cell adhesion and motility (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gumbiner, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>). Despite the relevance of monocyte/macrophage motility and adhesion to hemostasis, inflammation, and immunity, the molecular mechanisms governing these processes have been studied mostly in fibroblasts (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zachary and Rozengurt, 1992</xref>). A detailed molecular analysis of the effects triggered by prouPA may provide some clues to such mechanisms in myelomonocytic cells. In particular, the nonsignaling, di-substituted variant can be instrumental in additional studies aimed at identifying the membrane partners of pro-uPA and the molecular details of these critical interactions. Also, the maximized expression level of the nonphosphorylatable variants encoded by the mini-genes will hopefully give the opportunity to study both the regulation and the tissue specificity of these sites.</p>
      <p>In a previous paper, we have shown that phosphorylated pro-uPA is less sensitive to the inhibition by PAI-1; recent data suggest that it also render pro-uPA more susceptible to the activation by plasmin (Iaccarino, C., P. Franco, and M.P. Stoppelli, unpublished observations). Conversely, this work presents evidence that phosphorylation inhibits uPA-dependent control of myelomonocytic adherence and motility. In conclusion, phosphorylation of pro-uPA can be regarded as a remarkable mechanism which alters the properties of pro-uPA, indirectly enhancing its catalytic activity and reducing its signaling ability. It is tempting to speculate that in highly invasive cells phosphorylation of pro-uPA is a means to prevent pro-uPAâdependent control of cytoskeleton while favoring PAI-1âinsensitive matrix degradation.</p>

        <p>Construction of the mini-genes encoding prouPA<sup>138E</sup> and pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>. A map of the intron-exon organization of pro-uPA gene showing the regions and the restriction sites relevant to the construction of the cDNA/gene hybrids is shown at the top of the figure. Exons are indicated by boxes and roman numbers, introns are indicated by solid lines and capital letters (<italic>BâJ</italic>), broken lines correspond to absent introns. Specific restriction fragments of prouPA cDNA carrying the mutations were fused to genomic regions to generate new coding units or mini-genes, encoding full pro-urokinase variants. The figure depicts the mini-gene<sup>138E</sup>, carrying the introns B, C, D, E, I, and J and encoding pro-uPA<sup>138E</sup> and the minigene<sup>138E/303E</sup>, containing the introns B, C, D, E and encoding pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>.</p>

        <p>Effect of phosphorylation on the ability of pro-uPA to promote adhesion of differentiating U937 cells.

Then, they were incubated with the following effectors at the concentration of 1 nM: His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>, His-pro-uPA<sup>138E</sup>, His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup>, Ser-uPA (nonphosphorylated pro-uPA), Pser-uPA (phosphorylated pro-uPA), and DFPPser-uPA (DFP-inactivated Pser-uPA). Control samples included a combination of 5 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>138E/303E</sup> and 1 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> (WT+138E/303E) and a preincubation of the cells with 10 Î¼g/ml anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody for 1 h before the addition of 1 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup> (WT+399Ab). The number of adherent and non-adherent cells was counted 30 min later and reported as a percentage of the maximal adherence observed (37.5% of the total cell number, with 1 nM His-pro-uPA<sup>wt</sup>, over a background of 12.6% due to the TGF-Î²/vitamin D<sub>3</sub> addition).
