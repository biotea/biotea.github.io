        <p>
<italic>DTNBP1</italic> has been recognized as a schizophrenia susceptible gene, and its protein product, dysbindin-1, is down-regulated in the brains of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the physiological role of dysbindin-1 in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that disruption of dysbindin-1 with unidentified proteins could contribute to pathogenesis and the symptoms of schizophrenia. GST pull-down from human neuroblastoma lysates showed an association of dysbindin-1 with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex. The DNA-PK complex interacts only with splice isoforms A and B, but not with C. We found that isoforms A and B localized in nucleus, where the kinase complex exist, whereas the isoform C was found exclusively in cytosol. Furthermore, results of phosphorylation assay suggest that the DNA-PK complex phosphorylated dysbindin-1 isoforms A and B in cells. These observations suggest that DNA-PK regulates the dysbindin-1 isoforms A and B by phosphorylation in nucleus. Isoform C does not contain exons from 1 to 6. Since schizophrenia-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur in these introns between exon 1 and exon 6, we suggest that these SNPs might affect splicing of <italic>DTNBP1</italic>, which leads to impairment of the functional interaction between dysbindin-1 and DNA-PK in schizophrenic patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (<italic>DTNBP1</italic>, dysbindin-1) consists of approximately 350 amino acids and was originally identified by Benson et al. <xref rid="pone.0004199-Benson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> as a dystrobrevin-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Dysbindin-1 attracted interest in 2002 when variations in the gene encoding it at chromosomal locus 6p22.3 were reported to be associated with schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0004199-Straub1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, suggesting a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. Since then, many groups have reported data that collectively support a link between schizophrenia and <italic>DTNBP1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0004199-Schwab1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Vilella1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Hence, genetic variations in the dysbindin-1 gene might be a major risk factor for schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>Previous reports have shown that diverse high-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes could influence dysbindin-1 mRNA expression <xref rid="pone.0004199-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Weickert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, schizophrenics demonstrate reduced dysbindin-1 mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus <xref rid="pone.0004199-Weickert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Weickert2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and lower protein expression levels of dysbindin-1 have been observed post-mortem in the hippocampus of schizophrenics compared to age-matched controls <xref rid="pone.0004199-Talbot1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, dysbindin-1 is involved in glutamatergic <xref rid="pone.0004199-Numakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Talbot1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and dopaminergic neurotransmission <xref rid="pone.0004199-Kumamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Iizuka1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Collectively, this suggests that the physiological function of dysbindin-1 might be impaired in schizophrenia patients. Nevertheless, the functions of dysbindin-1 in the central nervous system (CNS) remain unclear.</p>
      <p>To identify the proteins that interact with dysbindin-1, we examined dysbindin-1 binding proteins in lysates from human neuroblastoma cells by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. We found that the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex bound to dysbindin-1 and phosphorylated dysbindin-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, the functional complex interacted with dysbindin-1 in an isoform-selective manner. Dysbindin-1 isoforms A and B interacted with DNA-PK and localized in the nuclei where DNA-PK complex functions. DNA-PK phosphorylated these isoforms in cells, implying that DNA-PK regulates them by phosphorylations in nucleus. Isoform C does not interact with DNA-PK, not phosphorylated, nor localized in nucleus. These observations suggest a novel function and differences among isoforms of dysbindin-1 in mammalian cells, which could shed new light on the etiology of schizophrenia.</p>

        <title>Identification of dysbindin-1-associated proteins</title>
        <p>To identify proteins that interact with dysbindin-1 in neuronal cells, GST and GST-dysbindin-1 were purified and used to perform pull-down assays in lysates from human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), mouse brain, and skeletal muscle. The purities of GST and GST-dysbindin-1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to separate the purified proteins, and the gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, the apparent molecular weights (MW) of GST and GST-dysbindin-1 were 30 and 70 kDa, respectively.</p>

            <p>A) Expression of the GST and GST-dysbindin-1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (asterisk). Purified GST and GST-dysbindin-1 were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. B) Proteins identified as dysbindin-1-associated proteins. The purification of GST-dysbindin-1, isolation of lysates from the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, and the pull-down assays were performed as described in the â<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.â Eluates of the GST- or GST-dysbindin-1 associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB. Lanes 1 and 2 represent GST and GST-dysbindin-1 alone without cell extract, and lanes 3 and 4 show the associated proteins pulled down by incubating whole-cell extracts from SH-SY5Y cells with GST-dysbindin-1 or GST, respectively. The appropriate portions of the polyacrylamide gel containing the specific protein bands in lane 3 were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as described in the â<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.â The arrows indicate the proteins identified by MALDI-TOF-MS with a high score.</p>

        <p>Proteins that were captured by GST or GST-dysbindin-1 were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by CBB staining. Five proteins, which were â¼80, 115, 120, 157, and 470 kDa, respectively, were co-purified from SH-SY5Y cell lysates with GST-dysbindin-1, but not with GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These protein bands were excised from the gel, subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and analyzed by mass assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). They were reproducibly identified as ATP-dependent DNA helicase 2 (Ku80), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family, member 1 (PARP1), adaptor-related protein complex 3, beta 2 subunit (AP3b2), leucine-rich PPR-motif containing protein (LRPPRC), and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). Interestingly, three of these proteins, Ku80, PARP1, and DNA-PKcs, are components of the DNA-PK functional complex <xref rid="pone.0004199-Meek1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Collis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This suggests that dysbindin-1 might possibly interact with the DNA-PK complex and influence its function. In addition, we also identified several mouse dysbindin-1-associated proteins from mouse brain or skeletal muscle homogenates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004199-t001">Table 1</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated an interaction of AP3b2 with dysbindin-1, which we also identified in screenings of both mouse brain and SH-SY5Y cells. Therefore, we focused on the three components of the DNA-PK complex and investigated their interactions with dysbindin-1 because they revealed the highest PMF score, they are known to physiologically function as a complex, and their interactions with dysbindin-1 have not been defined.</p>

        <title>Endogenous dysbindin-1 interacts with Ku70/80 in SH-SY5Y cells</title>
        <p>According to previous studies, it is known that Ku70 forms a heterodimer with Ku80 and is also a component of the DNA-PK complex<xref rid="pone.0004199-Weaver1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. All members of the DNA-PK complex except for Ku70 were identified as binding partners of dysbindin-1, which led us to examine the binding of Ku70/80 to dysbindin-1. To confirm the interaction between endogenous dysbindin-1 and Ku70/80, we generated a polyclonal anti-dysbindin-1 antibody by immunizing rabbits with GST-dysbindin-1 as described in the â<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.â Three isoforms of human dysbindin-1 exist in the NCBI database. Hence, the specificity of the dysbindin-1 antibody was evaluated by immunoblotting using lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with myc-dysbindin-1s (isoforms AâC). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, all three isoforms of dysbindin-1 were detected by the dysbindin-1 antibody (center panel) but not by the antigen-absorbed antibody (left panel). In the absence of myc-dysbindin-1, this antibody reacted weakly with a protein band near the estimated MW of dysbindin-1. The antigen-absorbed antibody did not show immunoreactivity with proteins at this MW. Therefore, we conclude that this band was endogenous dysbindin-1 and used the dysbindin-1 antibody to detect endogenous dysbindin-1 in subsequent experiments.</p>

            <p>A) The anti-dysbindin-1 antibody recognizes all isoforms of human dysbindin-1. The lysates of COS-7 cells overexpressing each isoform were detected by Western blotting using the anti-dysbindin-1 antibody (center panel), the antigen-absorbed antibody (left panel), or the anti-myc antibody (right panel). In the lanes 8 and 12, there were two bands, lower one of which was thought to be the degraded form of isoform C. B) Endogenous Ku70/80 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous dysbindin-1. Immunoprecipitation was performed using SH-SY5Y cells with the anti-dysbindin-1 antibody or normal rabbit IgG (negative control). As indicated by the arrowheads, Ku70 and Ku80 immunoprecipitated with dysbindin-1 (indicated by arrows), which was pulled down with the anti-dysbindin-1 antibody (lanes 5â7). In the overexposured immunoblot, two more bands corresponding to isoforms C and B were detected, indicating that the protein levels of these isofoms were much lower than that of isoform A.</p>

        <p>To ascertain whether endogenous dysbindin-1 interacts with Ku70/80 in neuronal cells, immunoprecipitation assays were performed in SH-SY5Y cells with the anti-dysbindin-1 antibody or with non-specific rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The proteins immunoprecipitated by the anti-dysbindin-1 antibody or control IgG were sequentially eluted into three fractions (E1 to E3) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, the anti-dysbindin-1 antibody immunoprecipitated dysbindin-1 and co-immunoprecipitated Ku70 and Ku80; control IgG did not immunoprecipitate dysbindin-1, Ku70, or Ku80. These data suggest that dysbindin-1 might interact with Ku70 and Ku80 in neuronal cells under physiological conditions. However, Ku70 was not identified as a dysbindin-1 binding partner in our pull-down screening. We infer that Ku70 was obscured by the robust dysbindin-1 band because the molecular weight of Ku70 is nearly equal to that of GST-dysbindin-1.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, dysbindin-1 appeared to localize primarily to the cytoplasm, but also showed some diffuse localization in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g003">Fig. 3A a-2</xref>).

        <p>Since this immunocytochemical approach could not clearly show the nuclear localization of dysbindin-1, we performed subcellular fractionation of SH-SY5Y cells followed by immunoblotting. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were confirmed by immunoblotting using the marker protein antibodies anti-Î±-tubulin and anti-lamin B, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, endogenous dysbindin-1 was unambiguously localized to both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, which is in accord with our immunocytochemical staining data. We also investigated the subcellular distribution of Ku70/80.

Furthermore, we identified three bands in whole-cell lysates and cytosolic fractions and a single band in the nuclear fraction. The upper, middle, and lower bands are consistent in MW with isoforms A, C, and B, respectively; hence, we hypothesize that isoform A can localize to the nucleus but not isoform C and that it might have a specific biological purpose there.</p>

<italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation of dysbindin-1 by the DNA-PK complex</title>
        <p>We next investigated the functional meaning of binding between dysbindin-1 and DNA-PK complex. As DNA-PK complex is known to be a serine/threonine kinase, we examined whether dysbindin-1 influences DNA-PK kinase activity by comparing the intrinsic kinase activity of the DNA-PK complex in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with myc-dysbindin-1 or empty vector. DNA-PK activities were determined by measuring incorporation of [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P] into a synthetic peptide from [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP by liquid scintillation counting.

        <p>Next, we investigated whether dysbindin-1 was a substrate for phosphorylation by DNA-PK.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we identified interaction partners of dysbindin-1 in neuronal cells, mouse brain, and muscle by GST pull-down screening. Dysbindin-1 is a member of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) <xref rid="pone.0004199-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and is thought to be involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking (i.e., protein sorting and vesicle docking and fusion), because genetic deletion of each component of BLOC-1 leads to disruption of intracellular vesicular trafficking in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. All BLOC-1 knockout mice have phenotypes characteristic of Hermansky-pudlack syndrome (HPS), i.e., hypopigmentation of both coat and eyes due to melanosome defects and prolonged bleeding times resulting from platelet dense body defects <xref rid="pone.0004199-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Sandy mice in which dysbindin-1 genes are disrupted also demonstrate such phenotypes and have often been used as HPS model mice <xref rid="pone.0004199-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In this study, one of the novel dysbindin-1 binding partners identified was a component of the AP-3 complex, AP3b2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004199-t001">Table 1</xref>). This complex appears to be functionally similar to BLOC-1 because genetic disruption of AP-3 components also results in HPS-like symptoms in mice <xref rid="pone.0004199-Ciciotte1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Kantheti1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Huizing2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Moreover, physical and functional interactions between BLOC-1 components and AP-3 components were reported recently <xref rid="pone.0004199-DiPietro1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Salazar1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Accordingly, we detected the binding of AP3b2 to dysbindin-1, implying that our GST pull-down screening worked well. However, dystrobrevin-1, which was reported to bind to dysbindin-1 in a yeast two-hybrid system <xref rid="pone.0004199-Benson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, was not identified as a dysbindin-1 binding partner. Lack of detection of dystrobrevin-1 in these pull-down assays could be due to the inability to separate dystrobrevin-1 from GST-dysbindin-1 by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, we were interested in the interaction between dysbindin-1 and the DNA-PK complex, which is involved in transcription <xref rid="pone.0004199-Feldmann1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, DNA recombination <xref rid="pone.0004199-Taccioli1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, and DNA repair <xref rid="pone.0004199-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Rathmell1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-LeesMiller1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Yaneva1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> in many kinds of cells. The physiological role of dysbindin-1 in the nucleus remains to be elucidated, although dysbindin-1 was also reported to localize to nuclei of hippocampal neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0004199-Talbot1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We demonstrated that both endogenous and exogenous dysbindin-1 bound to components of DNA-PK, Ku70, and Ku80 in neuronal cells by immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemical staining, and subcellular fractionation. Interestingly, dysbindin-1 was also phosphorylated by DNA-PK, suggesting a functional consequence of the interaction. Although phosphorylation of some substrates by DNA-PK is activated by dsDNA <xref rid="pone.0004199-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Suwa1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, dysbindin-1 phosphorylation by DNA-PK was not affected by the addition of dsDNA, indicating that phosphorylation of dysbindin-1 might not be involved in DNA repair. This is consistent with the idea that DNA-independent DNA-PK activity might also play an important role in transcriptional regulation besides recombination and double-stranded DNA repair as previously described<xref rid="pone.0004199-Yavuzer1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Ko2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we found that three isoforms (A, B, and C) of dysbindin-1 interacted with Ku70/80 in different manners in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Functional differences between these isoforms have not been reported, and the isoform-dependent binding of dybindin-1 to DNA-PK may be of importance. Interestingly, the same isoform-dependency was observed in subcellular localization and phosphorylation in cells. The consistency suggested that DNA-PK complex bound to and phosphorylated dysbindin-1 in mammalian cells as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay data showed that all three isoforms were phosphorylated by DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), implying that all purified isoforms of dysbindin-1 can bind to purified DNA-PK. We hypothesized that the distribution of dysbindin-1 in cells might be different among the isoforms and that localization differences could be the basis of their isoform-dependent interaction properties. Correspondingly, isoforms A and B were detected in considerable amounts in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g004">4</xref>). Hence, nuclear localization of isoforms A and B might facilitate their binding to Ku70/80. In contrast, isoform C, although abundant in total cell lysates, was not detected in the nuclear fraction. As isoform B appeared to be a minor dysbindin-1 according to its very low expression level in neuronal cells, the functional difference between isoform A and C might be of importance in terms of the physiological roles of dysbindin-1 in CNS.</p>
      <p>What is the difference between dysbindin-1 isoforms A and C? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows the amino acid sequences of the spliced isoforms of dysbindin-1. It appears that isoform C is an N-terminally truncated form of isoform A. Hence, the N-terminal region of isoform A could possibly localize to nuclei and bind Ku70/80. To our surprise, almost all of the schizophrenia-related SNPs are found in the introns between exon 1 and exon 6, which are in isoforms A and B but not in C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004199-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0004199-Straub1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Kirov1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Tochigi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0004199-Tosato1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004199-Bray2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This led us to hypothesize that the schizophrenia-related SNPs in the coding region of the dysbindin-1 gene might affect its splicing variations and lead to a reduction in isoform A and an increase in the content of isoform C, which could be defective with regard to interaction with the DNA-PK complex.</p>

          <title>Schematic representation of the human dysbindin-1 gene and its three isoform structures.</title>
          <p>The gene encoding dysbindin-1 located at chromosomal locus 6p22.3, and its several genetic variations are associated with schizophrenia. These variations (SNPs and haplotypes) are located in intron or promoter regions, and almost all are located in the N-terminus of the gene. Red asterisks indicate major SNPs. Three isoforms (A, B, and C) of human dysbindin-1 were reported by NCBI. Isoform A encodes the longest isoform, and isoform B contains an additional segment in the coding region compared to isoform A. Isoform C contains an alternate splice site in the 5â² coding region and uses a downstream start codon, compared to isoform A; this isoform has a shorter N-terminus compared to isoform A.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, in this study we describe for the first time a functional interaction between dysbindin-1 and the DNA-PK complex and show a functional difference in dysbindin-1 isoforms. This newly acquired information provides a basis for the novel hypothesis that alternative splicing of dysbindin-1 due to schizophrenia-related SNPs may underlie the etiology of schizophrenia. Further studies that focus on the relationship between schizophrenia-related SNPs and dysbindin-1 splice variants and the expression levels of the three isoforms in the brains of post-mortem schizophrenic patients would be helpful in understanding the role of dysbindin-1 in schizophrenia.</p>

        <p>Three isoforms of human dysbindin-1 cDNA and mouse dysbindin-1 cDNA were cloned from a human fetal brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences) and a mouse brain cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. These cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare), which contained His-tagÃ6 at the C-terminus. The myc-dysbindin-1 contained myc-tagÃ6 at the N-terminus of dysbindin-1, and V5-dysbindin-1 contained a V5-tag at the C-terminus of â1. GST-dysbindin-1 was able to express GST protein at the N-terminus and His-tagÃ3 at the C-terminus of dysbindin-1. The full-length human Ku80 and Ku70 were cloned from a human fetal brain cDNA library by PCR. The cDNAs of Ku80 and Ku70 were subcloned into a pcDNA3.1 expression vector that contained a V5-tag in the C-terminus of the cDNA. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using a fully automated DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter).</p>

DTT-containing buffer (10 mM DTT in 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) was added to the gel pieces, and the gel pieces were incubated for 1 h at 56Â°C. After the samples had cooled to room temperature, the DTT-containing buffer was replaced with iodoacetamide-containing buffer (55 mM iodoacetamide 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>), and the gel pieces were vortexed for 45 min at room temperature. The gel pieces were then washed with 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> buffer and dehydrated by ACN several times repeatedly and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The gel pieces were then incubated in trypsin (Promega)-containing buffer (12.5 ng/ÂµL trypsin in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) in an ice-cold bath. After 45 min, the protein digestion was performed overnight at 37Â°C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.1% TFA in 50% (v/v) ACN/water. Peptides were extracted by the addition of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> in 50% ACN, with three changes (20 min per extraction) at room temperature, and concentrated. The peptides in the extract were purified from the supernatant by absorption onto ZipTipC18 (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Then, 0.3 ml of each eluted sample were spotted on the target plate repeatedly and dried at room temperature. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on an AXIMA-CFR mass spectrometer (Shimadzu). MALDI peptide spectra were calibrated using several peaks of self-digested trypsin and matrix ion as internal standards.
